        Unacceptable practices like plagiarism, publication in more than one journal, 
        fraudulent use of data, non or improper attribution of co-authorship, 
        among other unethical practices, will be treated by an ad hoc commission, 
        preferably defined among scientific board members. When confirmed, such 
      practices will entail the following consequences:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>In case of previously checked publications: the publication will be 
          withdrawn (through a bar written WITHDRAWN) and the research ethics 
          procedure commission will define the period during which the involved 
        authors will not be allowed to publish in the journal.</li>
        <li>In case of manuscripts under analysis: the authors will be contacted, 
          the manuscripts will be returned and the research ethics procedure commission 
          will define the period during which the authors will not be allowed 
          to publish in the journal.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Conflicts of interest must be disclosure for the Journal.</p>
      <p>The commission will take into account the orientations in the RC&amp;F 
        Regimen and will incorporate the experiences of the COPE - Committee on 
        Publication Ethics.</p>
<p><b>Guidelines for manuscript submission</b>

      <p>To check our guide for authors, please access  <a href="http://www.rcf.fea.usp.br/english/Guide_authors.aspx       ">http://www.rcf.fea.usp.br/english/Guide_authors.aspx </a>      
      <p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>1. Papers  are analyzed through the triple blind review system, in which: (i) the author  does not know who the reviewer is; (ii) the reviewer does not know who the  author is; and (iii) the associate editor does not know who the author is, but  knows who the reviewer is.</p>

        <p>2. Papers are analyzed for scope (editorial line), depth and clarity 

          of the presented idea, as well as accessibility to readers (faculty 

          members, executives, graduate and undergraduate students and Accounting, 

          Controllership, Actuarial Science and Finance experts).<br>

          It is very relevant that authors indicate what <b>gap</b> they want 

          to address, the <b>contribution</b> of the paper, the <b>applicability</b> 

          of the knowledge presented. These elements help the reviewers and editors 

          in their assessment.</p>

        <p>3. The manuscript should be original, i.e. it should not have been 

          forwarded for publication to any other publication vehicle in Portuguese 

          or any other language. In case the manuscript was previously disseminated 

          in congress annals, indicate the event name and place.</p>

        <p>4. The maximum number of authors is five. Upon publication, the list 

          of authors will be disseminated in the other indicated upon submission.</p>

        <p>5. Authors are fully and exclusively responsible for the contents. 

          Copyright should be transferred to the Department of Accountancy and 

          Actuarial Science at FEA/USP in advance.</p>

        <p>6. Originals will be published in Portuguese and English. Papers will 

          only be accepted if authors agree with the translation of their paper 

          to English, or from English to Portuguese, to be provided for by RC&amp;F 

          with a view to publication in the same journal.</p>

        <p>7. Exceptionally, studies written in Spanish can be accepted. In this 

          case too, the translation of the paper too English will be provided.</p>

        <p>8. Independently of the number of reviews, authors can only consider 

          that their papers will be published after receiving the information 

          that their manuscript HAS BEEN APPROVED.</p>

        <p>9. Submissions that do not comply with established formal guidelines 

          will be returned.</p>

        <p>10. In case of review, the authors are expected to return the file 

          with review marks, accompanied by a letter to the editor and reviewers, 

          explaining the changes made.</p>
