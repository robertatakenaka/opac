      <p><u>AMBIENTE  &amp; SOCIEDADE PAPER EVALUATION PROCESS</u></p>
      <p>Paper  evaluation process is as follows:</p>
      <p><b>(1) Initial Screening</b>: Assistant editors screen the paper for  compliance with publishing rules listed online. Within this phase there is no  paper rejection, editors only suggest modifications to the authors according to  the editorial criteria*. The sooner the author suits its paper to the changes  solicited, the quicker the evaluation process will be.</p>
      <p><b>(2) Pre-analysis</b>: The paper will pass through the sieve of the  editor-in-chief and assistant editors. Within this stage, some requirements are  analyzed, such as relatedness to the scope of the journal, originality, method  consistency, and interdisciplinary discussion. <u>There is paper rejection  within this phase. Evaluation proceeds without author identification.</u></p>
      <p><b>(3) Designation</b>: Should the papers be approved at the  pre-analysis stage, they will be designated to the associate editors. These are  responsible for following up the evaluation and indicate peer referees who will  proceed with the paper revision.</p>
      <p><b>(4) Evaluation</b>: In this final stage, the paper is evaluated by  a pair of referees using double-blind methodology. In some cases, it undergoes  the evaluation of further referees if the decision is tied. It is quite common  for the evaluators to suggest a series of adjustments, and again, the sooner  the author delivers the adjustments, the faster the analysis process.</p>
      <p>Should  the paper be approved at stage 4, it will be accepted for publishing in a yet  to be determined journal number.</p>

Authorial information will be concealed and kept  registered within the system. When saving your document, <strong>make sure to remove MS Word’s metadata</strong> (file author; last modified  by), in order to remove any possible author identification. <strong>Manuscripts with  author’s informations will not be accepted</strong>.

In edited book reviews, please review the book as a  whole, avoiding in that way, if possible, a review for each chapter.</li>
</ol>
      <p><b>B) PAYMENT SYSTEM</b></p>
      <p>Due to budget cut and support reduction by research  financing agencies,&nbsp;<strong>Ambiente &amp; Sociedade</strong>&nbsp;Journal has  started charging online paper submission since 2009.</p>
      <ol start="1" type="1">
        <li>Submission value is R$       200,00 (Two hundred reais) each paper submitted for       evaluation.&nbsp;<strong>There are no refunds if the paper is rejected.</strong>&nbsp;Editors       hope to count on the collaboration of all authors, and in that way ensure       the continuity of the journal.<br>
            <strong>The fee can be paid at Banco do Brasil:<br>
              ANPPAS<br>
              Agency: 3559-9<br>
              Account: 51117-X</strong></li>
        <li>From February 1st 2017       on the value charged for submission of article will be US 65,00 (sixty five U$       dollars) per manuscript submitted for evaluation. This increase is due to       the need to cover costs of production and management that imply being part       of Scielo collection. The resources obtained from the national funding       agency for 2016 have diminished and unfortunately they are much below the       necessary costs to produce four volumes yearly. It is to be recalled that       this value will not be reimbursed if the manuscript is refused. The       editors count with the understanding of all authors, as these resources are       essential to guarantee the periodicity and quality of the journal.</li>
        <li>The author has to annex the receipt of the rate in the submission Online  together with the manuscript as &ldquo;Supplemental File NOT for Review.
        .<br>
      </li>
      </ol>
      <p><b>C) BILINGUAL OR ENGLISH  PUBLISHING</b></p>
      <p>In order to expand the audience of the journal  and comply with Scielo trends, since Volume 16.1 (Jan/Mar 2013), <b>Ambiente &amp;  Sociedade</b> Journal has started publishing all articles in English language, in  addition to its original language (when in Portuguese or Spanish).</p>
      <ol><li>Translation to English is only compulsory if  approved for publication; During the evaluation phase it is required only the  paper in its original language. For translation, we suggest a list of  translators, aiming to maintain a language standard. <b>Authors are responsible for translation costs</b>.</li>
