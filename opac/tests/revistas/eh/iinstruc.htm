      <p>The  journal<em> Estudos Históricos</em> aims to  publish original works, with a historical perspective, of researchers from the  national and international academic community in the areas of History, Social  Sciences and similar. </p>
      <p> The  journal will only accept unpublished works of doctors and doctoral students in  the form of articles and bibliographic essays. It is editors’ responsibility to  evaluate the manuscripts in advance, in order to identify any <strong>improper</strong> conduct related to plagiarism,  self-plagiarism, conferring previous publications of authorship and third  parties on the same subject. When the improper conduct is identified, <em>Estudos Históricos</em> will deny the  evaluation of the article, informing the decision to those involved.</p>
      <p> All  articles submitted to the Editors will be submitted to two or more referees to  issue their evaluation. Secrecy will be maintained concerning the identity of  both the referees and the authors. The opinions may recommend: a) full  acceptance of the text; b) the complete refusal; c) acceptance with minor  modifications; d) acceptance with significant modifications, and the text, in  the latter two cases, is sent back to the author for the changes.</p>
      <p> The  final decision on the publication of the manuscript will always be the  Editors’, who value the geographical distribution of the authors to be  published. The Editors reserve the right to request also changes in the  original papers. The changes concerning standardization and writing, introduced  by the Editors themselves, will always aim at maintaining the homogeneity and  quality of the journal, while respecting the style and opinions of the authors.  The texts in English and Spanish, when accepted by the Editors, will be  published in their original language and, whenever possible, will be translated  into Portuguese.</p>
      <p> Each  article submitted to the journal should be accompanied by a list of up to six  keywords that identify the main topics and a summary in Portuguese, with  English and Spanish versions, with a maximum of 100 words, clearly stating the  purposes, methods used and the main conclusions of the study.</p>
      <p> If  the article results from research sponsored by a funding agency, it should be  mentioned. Information about the author (title and institutional linkage etc.)  and two declarations should also be forwarded to the editors: the first,  responsibility and originality, and the second, the assignment of copyright  (see models below). The articles published in the journal may also be available  in different media and on the Internet.</p>
      <p> The bibliographic essays should be structured around a critical analysis  of relevant national and/or international bibliography produced in the last  five years and related to the specific issue of the journal number.</p>
      <p> After the publication of an article in <em>Estudos Históricos</em>, the author will be subject to a two-year period without being able to  submit a new article proposal. The authors who collaborate as referees may not  submit an article to the same issue of the <em>Journal </em>to which they contributed.</p>
The journal<em> Estudos Históricos </em>does not charge a  submission fee. </td>

      <p><strong>1. Text - </strong>The  texts submitted to the Editors must be in the Portuguese, English or Spanish  languages, ​​and in DOC, DOCX or RTF format (considering they do not exceed  5MB), Times New Roman 12 font, double space, page A4. In this standard, texts  must have a minimum of 35 thousand characters and a maximum of 50 thousand  characters (with spaces) for article, a minimum of 20 thousand characters and a  maximum of 35 thousand characters (with spaces) for bibliographic essays,  including titles, notes and bibliographical references and excluding abstracts.  The authorship identification of the work must be removed from the file and the  'Properties' option of the Word or RTF document, thus guaranteeing the  journal's discretion.<br>
 <br>
<strong>2. Bibliographic notes and references - </strong>Notes  should be concise. Bibliographical references should not be made in notes, but  should appear in the main body of the text.

      <p> Examples:  According to Cassirer (1979: 46), the synthesis and production by knowledge ...</p>
      <p> The self that enunciates &quot;I&quot;  (Benveniste, 1972: 32) ...</p>
      <p><strong>3. Bibliographical references – </strong>The  bibliographical references should constitute a single list at the end of the  article, in alphabetical order. They must obey the norms of NBR 6023: 2002,  according to the following models:</p>
      <p> I)  in the case of books: a) author's surname (in capital letters), followed by the  name; b) title of the work (italic); c) edition number; d) place of  publication; e) name of the publisher; f) date of publication.</p>
