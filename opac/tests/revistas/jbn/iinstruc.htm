        Society of Nephrology (SBN) designed for publication of original works 
        from all relevant areas in the field of nephrology. In addition to the 
        regular numbers, JBN also publishes annual supplements that include JBNEducational, 
        primarily addressing clinical practice. For selection of articles, originality, 
        topic relevance, and quality of scientific methodology are evaluated,

      <p>The following are considered for publication</p>
      <p><b>Editorials</b></p>
      <p>An in-depth critical commentary prepared as a response to an Editors 
        invitation and/or submitted by a person with noteworthy experience on 
        the subject. Editorials may contain up to 900 words and 5 references.</p>
      <p><b>Original Articles</b></p>
      <p>These should present unpublished results from research, constituting 
        complete studies that contain all relevant information so that the reader 
        may reproduce the study or evaluate its results and conclusions. The manuscripts 
        may contain up to 5,000 words.</p>
      <p>The formal structure should contain Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, 
        and Conclusion sections. The use of subtitles is particularly recommended 
        in the discussion section. Clinical implications and limitations of the 
        study should be highlighted. It is also suggested that, when appropriate, 
        the Methods section be detailed regarding the study design, location, 
        participants, clinical outcomes of interest, and intervention. These manuscripts 
        should</p>
      <p>contain an Abstract with an Introduction, Objective(s), Methods, Results, 
        and Conclusion section.</p>
      <p><b>Short Communication</b></p>
      <p>These are original articles, however, less substantial than the regular 
        article, and are of particular interest in the area of nephrology, presenting 
        preliminary results or results of immediate relevance.</p>
      <p>Brief communications should contain up to 1,500 words. </p>
      <p>The manuscript should have an Abstract followed by the model for original 
        articles, and at maximum, one Table or Figure, as well as a maximum of 
        15 bibliographical references. Brief communications should be sent only 
        in Portuguese.</p>
      <p><b>Review Articles</b></p>
      <p>Reviews are preferentially solicited by the Editors to a specialist in 
        a particular area. The objective of these articles is to express and critically 
        evaluate the knowledge available on a determined topic, commenting on 
        studies from other authors and using a broad reference base, or on occasion, 
        responding to a spontaneous demand concerning a specific topic. These 
        should contain up to 6,000 words. The text should contain an Introduction, 
        a Discussion section, a Conclusion, and other subdivisions, when appropriate 
        (e.g., "Clinical Application", "Treatment"). These manuscripts should 
        present an Abstract, however, not necessarily structured. A broad reference 
        list, however, not excessive, should appear at the end of the manuscript; 
        preferably up to 80 references for this type of article.</p>
      <p><b>Update Articles</b></p>
      <p>To address current information relevant to the clinical practice, less 
        complete than the review articles. These should be preferentially, a response 
        to the editors' invitation, and occasionally upon spontaneous demand. 
        Updates should contain up to 2,000 words, and present an Abstract, not 
        necessarily structured, and preferably up to 40 bibliographical references.</p>
      <p><b>Case Reports</b></p>
      <p>Presentation of professional experience, based on a study of a peculiar 
        case and succinct comments of interest for the practice of other professionals 
        in the area. The report should contain up to 1,500 words. The structure 
        should contain at minimum the following sections: Introduction, explaining 
        the relevance of the case; Structured presentation of the case (i.e., 
        identification of the patient, complaints and previous history, personal 
        and familial antecedent, clinical exam), and Discussion.</p>
      <p><b>Clinical Trials</b></p>
      <p>All materials related to human and animal research must have prior approval 
        from the Institutional Review Boards - IRBs from the institution where 
        the work was done in accordance with the recommendations of the Declaration 
        of Helsinki (1964 and versions from 1975, 1983, and 1989), the International 
        Standards for the Protection of Animals, and the resolution 196/96 of 
        the Brazilian National Health Council on Research Involving Humans. Each 
        manuscript must contain the number of this protocol.</p>

      <p>Opinions or commentaries about the content, editorial views, or relevant 
        scientific topics of a journal; the text should be brief, with a maximum 
        of 500 words. The manuscript may be a commentary about published material, 
        or may bring new data and clinical observation. Only one Table and one 
        Figure are permitted, and a maximum of 5 references. All authors (maximum 
        of five) should sign the letter. Nephrological Consultation in 10 Minutes: 
        mandatory by invitation from the editors, this section was created to 
        offer the reader a rapid expertise on day to day</p>
      <p>topics in nephrology. The text should contain, on average 630 words, 
        only one Table and one Figure, and a maximum of 5 references.</p>
