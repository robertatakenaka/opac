      <p><b>5.</b> The <b>Revista de Odontologia da Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo</b>

    href="../rousp/iedboard.htm#Commission%20of%20publication">Commission of publication</a> 
        and of the Editorial board, that hold full authority to decide on the 
        convenience of the acceptance of a work. Those boards can also re-present 
        a work to the authors with suggestions in such a way that necessary alterations 
        in the text are made, and / or in order that the work be adapted to the 
        editorial standards of the journal. In such a case, the work will be re-evaluated 
        by the Commission of publication and the Editorial board. The works not 
        accepted for publication will be returned to the authors. The referees' 
        names will remain confidential. In the same way, the authors' names will 
        be omitted to the referees.</p>

      by two hard copies and three sets of original photographs. It is recommended 
      that the authors keep other copy in their possession.
      <p><b>2.</b> An original submitted for publication should contain at the

        to whom correspondence should be sent by the Commission of publication.</p>

      <p><b>4.</b> Coloured photographs will not be published, except in case 
        of absolute necessity and on the recommendations of the Commission of 
        publication.</p>
      <p><b>5.</b> The originals destined to the <b>Revista de Odontologia da 
        Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo</b> should be written in agreement with the 
        following standards (based on NB/61 of the Brazilian Association of Technical 
        Standards &#150; ABNT, 1978):</p>
      <p>a) The originals should follow the official spelling and should be typed 
        or computer printed double-spaced with margins of three centimetres on 
        paper size A4 (21 cm x 29,7 cm), and should not exceed 15 pages, including 
        the illustrations (graphics, tables, photographs etc.). The authors should 
        keep a copy of the original for possible eventualities.</p>
      <p>b) The illustrations (photographs, graphics, drawings etc.) should be 
        <b>limited</b> to the strictly indispensable, presented in separate sheets 
        and numbered consecutively in Arabic numerals. The respective legends 
        should be clear, concise and placed below of the illustrations, preceded 
        of the corresponding order number. The graphics, drawings and formulas 
        that serve to the preparation of the clich&eacute;s should be made in Indian 
        ink on white paper. Authors are required to avoid squared paper (unless 
        it is printed in clear blue). The illustrations should be presented in 
        sufficient size to allow reductions to the minimum of eight centimetres 
        in width. The approximate position of each illustration in the text should 
        be indicated in the margin.</p>
      <p>c) Tables should be numbered consecutively in Arabic numerals, and cited 
        in the text by those numerals. The legends should be placed on their top. 
        Tables should follow the presentation standards to tabulate, established 
        by the Conselho Nacional de Estat&iacute;stica (National Council of Statistics), 
        published by the IBGE in 1979.</p>
      <p>d) The footnotes should be indicated with a high asterisk and kept to 
        a minimum.</p>
      <p>e) The journal recommends the use of the composed names and the names 
        of the elements in the text, instead of their formulas or symbols; the 
        journal also recommends that: the periods of time be written out in full, 
        instead of numbers; the binomials of the zoological and botanical nomenclature 
        be also written out in full and underlined, instead of using abbreviations; 
        the mathematical and physical symbols be used according to the internationally 
        accepted rules, and the metric symbols be applied in agreement with the 
        Brazilian legislation into operation.</p>
      <p>f) In the preparation of the original, it should be observed, insofar 
        as possible, the following structure:</p>

          and <b>English</b>; when the article is written in English, the title 
          and subtitle should appear both in English and Portuguese).</li>

          describing the substantial issues of the text, and pointing out its 
          main conclusions. It allows the evaluation of the interest of the article 
          without reference to the complete text. The abstract should be centralized 
          in the sheet with larger margins than those of the text. There is no 
          need to include the title &quot;Abstract&quot;. For the redaction and 
          presentation style of the abstract, the authors should observe the rule 
          NB/88 of the ABNT, 1978, as well as the <i>Guide for the preparation 
          of author's abstracts for publication</i>, UNESCO, 1968.</li>

      <b>
      <p>Keywords
      </b>
