    <td width="70%"><p>The journal <b><i>Arquivos Internacionais de

        Otorrinolaringologia</i></b> publishes manuscripts from National and

        International scientific communities in the format of original articles on

        clinical and experimental research, literature review articles and

        meta-analysis, case reports articles, opinion articles and letters to the

        editor. The opinion articles and letters to the editor are subjected to

        invitation by the editor. Articles published in scientific events will be

        published in the journal <b><i>Arquivos Internacionais de

        Otorrinolaringologia</i></b> only after going through all the editorial steps

        of the journal. The journal <b><i>Arquivos Internacionais de

        Otorrinolaringologia</i></b> comes out every three months and supports the

        World Health Organization (WHO) and of the International Committee of Medical

        Journal Editors (ICMJE) politics regarding registration of clinical trials

        and also the recognition of these initiatives of registration and

        international spread of information regarding open access clinical trials.

        Therefore from now on we will only accept for publication articles of

        clinical trials that have been given a number of identification from one of

        the Clinical Essay Registry validated by the criteria established by the WHO

        and the ICMJE, which links are available at the ICMJE site&nbsp;<a

  href="http://www.icmje.org/" target="_blank">http://www.icmje.org/</a>.

        The identification number should be informed at the end of the abstract.</p>

      <p>The submitted manuscripts are initially evaluated

        regarding submission rules of the journal and then regarding scientific

        evaluation by the Editor, and if necessary they are sent to the Associated

        Editors with the same thematic area of the main subject of the manuscript.

        Afterwards, the manuscripts are revised by 2 (two) members of the editorial

        board, who are also well qualified in the area of Otorhinolaryngology, Head

        and Neck surgery, Allergies and Immunology, Phonoaudiology or correlated

        ones, in a double-blind evaluation system through peer review, from where

        revisors do not have information on the authors and vice-versa. Besides,

        revisers do not have any information on the other revisers who are analyzing

        the same article.</p>

      <p>All material is sent to revisers electonically. They can

        be accepted or not due to physical and schedule problems or even due to

        conflicts of personal, commercial, political, family, scientific or financial

        interests. Once agreed upon, revisions should be done within 15 (fifteen)

        days. Revisers should access the Managment Publication System - MPS using

        their private password, where the material for revision is available,

        according to the type of article, i.e. original, revision or case report.

        They have the options to approve, approve with considerations and require

        changes or even refuse it. The suggestions or comments from the revisers, if

        there is an approval, are sent back to the authors, also electronically, and

        they can contest it or not. Authors, also then, sent articles back either

        agreeing on the suggestions or opposing to them (by sustaining their ideas).

        Afterwards, articles will be evaluated by both, the same reviser and the

        editor. If articles are refused, they are sent back to authors. In case of

        conflicting opinions among revisers, there will be a third one and the

        Associated Editor or even the Editor will take part on the evaluation.</p>

      <p>Essays should be followed by Declaration of Copyright Transfer Statement 

        and by Declaration of Non-existing Conflict of Interest signed by authors, 

        besides the Declaration of Authorization of Images and Material Uses, 

        when necessary. The authors are exclusively responsible for the opinions 

        exposed on the studies. They are also totally responsible for the originality 

        of the material and for the non-simultaneous submission to other journals. 

        The approved works are published in printed and electronic formats and 

        become property of the journal in all languages and countries. Partial 

        or total reproduction is prohibited and so is the translation into other 

        languages without authorization from the journal. Manuscripts should be 

        submitted only electronically, through the Managment Publication System 

        - MPS at <u><a href="http://www.arquivosdeorl.org.br/sgp"

        related words. (THESE WORDS MUST BE PART OF DECS AND MESH), which can be

        found on&nbsp;<strong>MPS</strong>&nbsp;(Manager Publication System)on all

        of the screens.      </p>

      <p>Summary/Abstract must

        have 250 words at its maximum. The author should fill the following fields:

        Institution, Name and Mail Address, Financial Support (any other information

        on concessions or other type of financial support), and Letter to the Editor

      <p>In this step the

        Copyright and Conflict of Interest terms are displayed, which should be

        printed, so the author can be able to sign and collect signatures and inform
