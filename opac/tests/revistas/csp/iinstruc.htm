      <p>Cadernos  de Sa&uacute;de P&uacute;blica/Reports in Public Health (CSP) publishes original articles of high scientific merit, which contribute with the  study of public health in general and related disciplines. Since January 2016, CSP is only publishing its  online version, in a continuous publication system for articles in periodicals  indexed in the SciELO database. We recommend the authors to carefully read the  instructions before submitting their articles to CSP.</p>
    <p>As  the abstract of the article achieves more visibility and distribution that the  article per se, we suggest the specific recommendations for its writing be  carefully read. (<strong><a href="/img/revistas/csp/links_ing.doc">link abstract</a></strong>)<strong>.</strong></p>
    <p>There are no fees for  submission and evaluation of articles. </p>
    <p>The Journal adopts  Ephorous system for plagiarism identification. </p>
    <p>Articles  will be reviewed preferably by three consultants from the same field of  research, members of Brazilian and international teaching and research  institutions with proven scientific research production. Following corrections  and suggestions as appropriate, the article will be accepted by the Editorial  Board of CSP if it meets the journalâ€™s criteria for quality, originality, and  methodological rigor. </p>
    <p>The author retains  copyright of the work, giving the publication in Public Health, the right of  first publication. </p></td>
