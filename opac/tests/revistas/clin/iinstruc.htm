      </ul>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Authors are strongly       advised to use abbreviations sparingly whenever possible to avoid jargon       and improve the readability of the manuscript. All abbreviations&nbsp;must       be defined the first time that they are used. Only terms or expressions       that are used at least 5 times throughout the text should be abbreviated.       Never use abbreviations that spell&nbsp;common English words, such as FUN,       PIN, SCORE, and SUN.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>PROFESSIONAL  ENGLISH REVISION</strong></p>
      <p>Please keep in mind that accepted manuscripts must be sent by the  authors to the company American Journal Experts (<strong><a href="https://www.aje.com">https://www.aje.com</a></strong>) for premium editing prior to publication.  Manuscripts should use American English spelling. </p>
<p><strong>PUBLICATION  FEES</strong></p>
      <p><strong>CLINICS&nbsp;</strong>uses  a business model&nbsp;whereby expenses are&nbsp;partly recovered by charging  the authors, or research sponsors, a publication fee&nbsp;for each published  article. Original Articles  and Review Articles:<strong>&nbsp;US$ 1,500.00 (International authors)&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>R$  1.500,00 (Brazilian authors)</strong>. There are no charges for&nbsp;Invited reviews.</p>
    <p><strong>Waiver Policy:&nbsp;</strong>Most institutions and funding agencies have set up  funding sources to cover Article Publication Costs. Unfortunately&nbsp;<strong>CLINICS</strong>&nbsp;cannot  grant fee waivers due to its 2016 policies.</p></td>

    <td width="70%" height="924"><p><strong>ORIGINAL  ARTICLES</strong>:&nbsp;Complete original studies should be  submitted in this category. Original studies must conform to&nbsp;the following format:
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>Title:</strong>&nbsp;Up to  250 characters</li>
        <li><strong>Running  title:</strong> Up to 40 characters </li>
        <li>Authors' full names and  contribution: Authors should have participated sufficiently in the work to take  public responsibility for appropriate portions of the content. Such  participation must be declared in this section of the manuscript.</li>
        <li><strong>Any  financial or other relationships that may lead to a conflict of interest</strong>.      </li>
      </ul>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>Abstract: </strong>Abstracts are limited to 250       words and structured into objectives, method, results, and conclusions.       Citations or abbreviations (except internationally recognized       abbreviations, such as weights, measures, and&nbsp;physical or chemical       abbreviations) are not permitted. Authors are strongly encouraged not to       display numerical statistical information but to merely&nbsp;state what is       significantly different (or not) between the described parameters. <strong>Please make sure to always include your Abstract  in the main document file.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Keywords: </strong>For keywords, 3-6 items from       the Medical Subject Headings (MeSh) should be used.</li>
        <li><strong>Introduction: </strong>The introduction should set the       purpose of the study, provide a brief summary (not a review) of previous       relevant studies, and state the new advances in the current investigation.       The introduction should not include data or conclusions from the work       being reported. A final sentence summarizing the novel finding to be       presented is permissible.</li>
        <li><strong>Materials and       Methods: </strong>This       section should briefly give clear and sufficient information to permit the       study to be repeated by others. Standard techniques&nbsp;only need       to&nbsp;be referenced. Previously published methods may be briefly       described following the reference.</li>
        <li><strong>Ethics: </strong>When reporting experiments on       human subjects, indicate whether the procedures&nbsp;were in accordance       with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human       experimentation (institutional or regional) and with the Helsinki       Declaration. When reporting experiments       on animals, indicate whether the institution's guide,&nbsp;a national       research council's&nbsp;guide,&nbsp;or any national law on the care and       use of laboratory animals was followed.</li>
        <li><strong>Results: </strong>The results section should be a       concise account of the new information that was discovered, with the least       personal judgment. Do not repeat in&nbsp;text&nbsp;all the data in the       tables and illustrations but briefly describe what these data comprise.</li>
        <li><strong>Discussion: </strong>The discussion should include       the significance of the new information and relevance of the new findings       in light of&nbsp;existing knowledge. Only unavoidable citations should be       included. Citation to review articles&nbsp;are&nbsp;not encouraged in this       section.</li>
        <li><strong>Acknowledgments: </strong>This section should be       short,&nbsp;concise, and restricted to&nbsp;acknowledgments&nbsp;that are       necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>References in       text: </strong><strong>CLINICS</strong> adopts the Vancouver format.       Cite references in the&nbsp;text using Arabic numerals in the&nbsp;order       of appearance, within parentheses, (1) after the previous word, with       spacing as in this example: &ldquo;Diabetes (2), hypertension (3,4) and       alcoholism (5-9) are complex medical problems (10).&rdquo; Under exceptional       circumstances, authors&rsquo; names may appear in text:&nbsp;<u>Single author</u>:       &ldquo;Einstein (11) proposed a new theory &hellip;&rdquo;,&nbsp;<u>Two authors</u>: &ldquo;Watson       and Crick (12) reported on the structure of &hellip;&rdquo;, or&nbsp;<u>Three or more       authors</u>:&nbsp;&ldquo;Smith et al. (13) described &hellip;&rdquo;</li>
        <li><strong>Reference List: </strong>Only citations that appear in       the text should be referenced. References must be restricted to directly       relevant published works, papers, or abstracts. Unpublished papers, unless       accepted for publication, should not be cited. Work that is accepted for       publication should be referred to as &quot;in press&quot; and a letter of       acceptance of the journal must be provided. Authors are responsible for       the accuracy and completeness of their references and for correct       textcitation.&nbsp;Usually&nbsp;the total number of references should not       exceed 35. For up to 6 authors, list all authors. For more than 6 authors,       list first 6 authors&nbsp;followed by &ldquo;et al.&rdquo;.</li>
        <li><strong>Tables and Figures</strong>: <strong>Tables</strong>-&nbsp;Should be       constructed using the table feature in your word processor or using a       spreadsheet program such as Excel. The tables should be numbered       in&nbsp;order&nbsp;of appearance in the text, using Arabic numerals. Each       table should have a title and an explanatory legend, if necessary. All       tables must be referenced&nbsp;and succinctly described in the text. Under       no circumstances should a table repeat data that are presented in an       illustration. Statistical measures of variation (i.e., standard deviation       or standard error) should be identified, and decimal places in tabular       data should be restricted to those with mathematical and statistical       significance.&nbsp;<strong>Figures</strong>:&nbsp;Photographs,       illustrations, charts, drawings, line graphs, etc. are all defined as       figures. Number&nbsp;figures consecutively using Arabic numerals in order       of appearance. Figure legend(s) should be descriptive and should allow       examination of the figure without reference to&nbsp;text. Images must be       of professional quality and uploaded as *.tiff files. Generally, figures       will be reduced to fit one column of text. The actual magnification of all       photomicrographs should be provided, preferably by placing a&nbsp;scale       bar on the print. Line graphs and charts should&nbsp;never be sent as       *.jpeg illustrations. We recommend preparing line graphs and charts as       Excel&reg; files and copying these files into a Word *.doc sheet.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>REVIEW ARTICLES:</strong>&nbsp;Review&nbsp;articles  should cover themes that are relevant to medical practice. Spontaneously  submitted reviews are welcome; however,&nbsp;potential authors should bear in  mind that they are expected to have expertise in the reviewed field. The sections should be arranged  as follows:&nbsp;</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>Title</strong><strong>:</strong> Up to 250 characters</li>
        <li><strong>Running  title:</strong> Up to 40 characters</li>
        <li><strong>Authors'  full names and contributions:</strong> Authors should have  participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for  appropriate portions of the content. Such participation must be declared in  this section of the manuscript. Any financial or other relationships that may  lead to a conflict of interest.      </li>
      </ul>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Abstract, keywords and       text should be arranged&nbsp;to cover the subject that is being reviewed.       </li>
        <li>If appropriate, the method of&nbsp;reference collection should be described.       </li>
        <li>The use of headings, subheadings, and paragraph titles is encouraged to       improve clarity. </li>
        <li>Abbreviations, acknowledgments,&nbsp;tables&nbsp;and       figures should be formatted as described in the Original Articles  section.       </li>
        <li>The number of references is at the discretion of the authors. </li>
        <li>No       publication fee discount is allowed for spontaneously submitted review       articles that are&nbsp;accepted for publication.&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
