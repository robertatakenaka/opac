If the paper is in accordance with this Instructions to Authors and  with the editorial policies of the Journal, it will be reviewed by two referees  assigned by the Editor-in-Chief.

      <p>5. <strong>Authorship</strong> - A maximum of eight authors  per manuscript is allowed. Studies with more than eight authors should include  a statement providing a reason for the inclusion of each author. In cases of  collective (corporate) authorship, the group should identify the individuals  taking direct responsibility for the manuscript. According to the Uniform  Requirements, edited by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors  (ICMJE), &ldquo;authorship credit should be based on: 1) substantial contributions to  conception and design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of  data; 2) drafting the article or revising it critically for important  intellectual content; and 3) final approval of the version to be published.  Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, and 3&rdquo; (original text available at <a href="http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html">http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html</a>). Inclusion  of authors&rsquo; names whose contributions do not fulfill these criteria is not  recommended nor warranted. Also, authors&rsquo; names will be published in the exact  order in which they appear in the title page of the original submission. The  order of authors cannot be changed, and authors cannot be added or removed,  after acceptance or during the production stage, unless a justification for  such change, in writing, signed by all authors, is timely presented to the  Editorial Office team. J Vasc Bras. publishes author contributions. A  supplementary statement describing the specific contributions of each author to  the study should be provided for each manuscript, as described in detail below.</p>
      <p>6.  <strong>Decision and translation</strong> - Authors will  be informed of the acceptance of their articles via a decision letter sent by  our submission system. This message is the official acceptance document issued  by the Journal; no other documents will be issued with the same purpose. Once  accepted, manuscripts will enter the production process (press) of J Vasc Bras.  and will be published in a future issue, as decided by the Editor-in-Chief.  Changes to the text or to author names will not be allowed at this stage.  Manuscripts accepted in Portuguese or Spanish will be translated into English  by the journal's production team, and the translation will be subjected to the  corresponding author's approval; manuscripts accepted in English will be  revised/copyedited by the journal's production team, and the final version will  be subjected to the corresponding author's approval. The editorial office of  the Journal will not provide information on the exact date of publication or on  the issue in which the article will be published, since the contents of each  issue are decided exclusively by the Editor-in-Chief.</p>
      <p>        7.  Before publication, content proofs (in MS  Word&copy; DOCX file) and layout proofs (PDF file) are sent to the corresponding  author for approval. Authors should download Acrobat Reader (<a href="http://get.adobe.com/br/reader/">http://get.adobe.com/br/reader/</a>, download  free of charge) to read the  PDF file. Proof corrections should be limited to typesetting errors. No  substantial changes will be accepted at this stage. Corrected proofs should be  returned within 48 hours of receipt via e-mail. Once the production process of  the PDF files is completed, the article will be sent to publication ahead of  print at SciELO (<u><a href="http://www.scielo.br/jvb" target="_blank">http://www.scielo.br/jvb</a>).</u> </p>

      3. <strong>Registration of Clinical Trials</strong> - J  Vasc Bras. supports the policy of registration of clinical trials by the World  Health Organization (WHO) and the ICMJE, recognizing the importance of such  initiatives for registration and public access to information on clinical  trials. According to this recommendation, clinical trials should be registered  in one of the Clinical Trials Registries recommended by the WHO and the ICMJE.  Addresses are available at the ICMJE website (e.g., <a href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</a>, <a href="http://www.isrctn.org">www.ISRCTN.org</a>, <a href="http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/index.htm">www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/index.htm</a> e <a href="http://www.trialregister.nl">www.trialregister.nl</a>). In Brazil, clinical trials can be registered  on www. ensaiosclinicos.gov.br. To this end, the first requirement is to obtain  a registration number for the study, named UTN (Universal Trial Number), at the  link <a href="http://www.who.int/ictrp/unambiguous_identification/utn/en/">http://www.who.int/ictrp/unambiguous_identification/utn/en/</a> and also import the xml file of the study  registered at Plataforma Brasil (<a href="http://aplicacao.saude.gov.br/plataformabrasil/login.jsf">http://aplicacao.saude.gov.br/plataformabrasil/login.jsf</a>). The clinical trial registration number should  appear in a statement below the abstract. All manuscripts resulting from  randomized clinical trials should have a clinical trial registration number.</td>

      <p><strong>1.9.  References</strong> </p>
      <p>All the authors and works cited in the text should be  included in the reference list and vice-versa. References should be numbered  consecutively in the order in which they appear in the text (not in  alphabetical order), identified by superscript numbers (not by numbers in  parentheses). References should follow the order in which they appear in the  text. Avoid citing too many references. Select the most relevant references,  and focus on the most recent works (past 5 years).</p>
      <p> If possible and relevant, cite Brazilian and Latin  American authors via the following sources: LILACS (<a href="http://www.bireme.com.br">www.bireme.com.br</a>), SciELO (<a href="http://www.scielo.br">www.scielo.br</a>),&nbsp; J Vasc Bras. (<a href="http://www.scielo.br/jvb">www.scielo.br/jvb</a> e <a href="http://www.jvascbras.com.br">www.jvascbras.com.br</a>).</p>
      <p> Avoid citations that are not easily available to  readers, such as abstracts presented at conferences, thesis&nbsp; or restricted publications. Do not use  &ldquo;personal communications&rdquo; as references. Papers that have been accepted for  publication but not yet published may be cited followed by the expression &ldquo;in  press.&rdquo; For citation of other works by the authors, select only original journal  articles which are related to the topic under discussion (do not include book  chapters or review articles). The authors are responsible for the accuracy of  the references and should follow the style shown in the examples below. </p>
