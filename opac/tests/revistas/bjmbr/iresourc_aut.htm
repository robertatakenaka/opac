      <p>A small group of editors of general medical journals met informally in 

        Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1978 to establish guidelines for the format 

        of manuscripts submitted to their journals. The group became known as 

        the Vancouver Group. Its requirements for manuscripts, including formats 

        for bibliographic references developed by the National Library of Medicine, 

        were first published in 1979. The Vancouver Group expanded and evolved 

        into the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), which 

        meets annually; gradually it has broadened its concerns.</p>

      <p>The committee has produced five editions of the Uniform Requirements 

        for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals. Over the years, issues 

        have arisen that go beyond manuscript preparation. Some of these issues 

        are now covered in the Uniform Requirements; others are addressed in separate 

        statements. Each statement has been published in a scientific journal.</p>

      <p>The fifth edition (1997) is an effort to reorganize and reword the fourth 

        edition to increase clarity and address concerns about rights, privacy, 

        descriptions of methods, and other matters. The total content of Uniform 

        Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals may be reproduced 

        for educational, not-for-profit purposes without regard for copyright; 

        the committee encourages distribution of the material.</p>

      <p>Journals that agree to use the Uniform Requirements (over 500 do so) 

        are asked to cite the 1997 document in their instructions to authors. 

        It is important to emphasize what these requirements do and do not imply.</p>

      <p>First, the Uniform Requirements are instructions to authors on how to 

        prepare manuscripts, not to editors on publication style. (But many journals 

        have drawn on them for elements of t heir publication styles.)</p>

      <p>Second, if authors prepare their manuscripts in the style specified in 

        these requirements, editors of the participating journals will not return 

        the manuscripts for changes in style before considering them for publication. 

        In the publishing process, however, the journals may alter accepted manuscripts 

        to conform with details of their publication style.</p>

      <p>Third, authors sending manuscripts to a participating journal should 

        not try to prepare them in accordance with the publication style of that 

        journal but should follow the Uniform Requirements.</p>

      <p>Authors must also follow the instructions to authors in the journal as 

        to what topics are suitable for that journal and the types of papers that 

        may be submitted-for example, original articles, reviews, or case reports. 

        In addition, the journal's instructions are likely to contain other requirements 

        unique to that journal, such as the number of copies of a manuscript that 

        are required, acceptable languages, length of articles, and approved abbreviations.</p>

      <p>Participating journals are expected to state in their instructions to 

        authors that their requirements are in accordance with the Uniform Requirements 

        for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals and to cite a published 

        version.</p>

      <p><b>Redundant or Duplicate Publication</b></p>

      <p>Redundant or duplicate publication is publication of a paper that overlaps 

        substantially with one already published.</p>

      <p>Readers of primary source periodicals deserve to be able to trust that 

        what they are reading is original unless there is a clear statement that 

        the article is being republished by the choice of the author and editor. 

        The bases of this position are international copyright laws, ethical conduct, 

        and cost-effective use of resources.</p>

      <p>Most journals do not wish to receive papers on work that has already 

        been reported in large part in a published article or is contained in 

        another paper that has been submitted or accepted for publication elsewhere, 

        in print or in electronic media. This policy does not preclude the journal 

        considering a paper that has been rejected by another journal, or a complete 

        report that follows publication of a preliminary report, such as an abstract 

        or poster displayed for colleagues at a professional meeting. Nor does 

        it prevent journals considering a paper that has been presented at a scientific 

        meeting but not published in full or that is being considered for publication 

        in a proceedings or similar format. Press reports of scheduled meetings 

        will not usually be regarded as breaches of this rule, but such reports 

        should not be amplified by additional data or copies of tables and illustrations.</p>

      <p>When submitting a paper, the author should always make a full statement 

        to the editor about all submissions and previous reports that might be 

        regarded as redundant or duplicate publication of the same or very similar 

        work. The author should alert the editor if the work includes subjects 

        about which a previous report has been published. Any such work should 

        be referred to and referenced in the new paper. Copies of such material 

        should be included with the submitted paper to help the editor decide 

        how to handle the matter.</p>

      <p>If redundant or duplicate publication is attempted or occurs without 

        such notification, authors should expect editorial action to be taken. 

        At the least, prompt rejection of the submitted manuscript should be expected. 

        If the editor was not aware of the violations and the article has already 

        been published, then a notice of redundant or duplicate publication will 

        probably be published with or without the author's explanation or approval.</p>

      <p>Preliminary reporting to public media, governmental agencies, or manufacturers, 

        of scientific information described in a paper or a letter to the editor 

        that has been accepted but not yet published violates the policies of 

        many journals. Such reporting may be warranted when the paper or letter 

        describes major therapeutic advances or public health hazards such as 

        serious adverse effects of drugs, vaccines, other biological products, 

        or medicinal devices, or reportable diseases. This reporting should not 

        jeopardize publication, but should be discussed with and agreed upon by 

        the editor in advance.</p>

      <p><b>Acceptable Secondary Publication</b></p>

      <p>Secondary publication in the same or another language, especially in 

        other countries, is justifiable, and can be beneficial, provided all of 

        the following conditions are met.</p>

      <p>1. The authors have received approval from the editors of both journals; 

        the editor concerned with secondary publication must have a photocopy, 

        reprint, or manuscript of the primary version.<br>

        2. The priority of the primary publication is respected by a publication 

        interval of at least one week (unless specifically negotiated otherwise 

        by both editors).<br>

        3. The paper for secondary publication is intended for a different group 

        of readers; an abbreviated version could be sufficient.<br>

        4. The secondary version faithfully reflects the data and interpretations 

        of the primary version.<br>

        5. The footnote on the title page of the secondary version informs readers, 

        peers, and documenting agencies that the paper has been published in whole 

        or in part and states the primary reference. A suitable footnote might 

        read: "This article is based on a study first reported in the [title of 

        journal, with full reference]." 

      <p>Permission for such secondary publication should be free of charge.</p>

      <p><b>Protection of Patients' Rights to Privacy</b></p>

      <p>Patients have a right to privacy that should not be infringed without 

        informed consent. Identifying information should not be published in written 

        descriptions, photographs, and pedigrees unless the information is essential 

        for scientific purposes and the patient (or parent or guardian) gives 

        written informed consent for publication. Informed consent for this purpose 

        requires that the patient be shown the manuscript to be published.</p>

      <p>Identifying details should be omitted if they are not essential, but 

        patient data should never be altered or falsified in an attempt to attain 

        anonymity. Complete anonymity is difficult to achieve, and informed consent 

        should be obtained if there is any doubt. For example, masking the eye 

        region in photographs of patients is inadequate protection of anonymity.</p>

      <p>The requirement for informed consent should be included in the journal's 

        instructions for authors. When informed consent has been obtained it should 

        be indicated in the published article.</p>

      <p><b>Summary of Technical Requirements</b></p>

      <p>· Double space all parts of manuscripts.<br>

        · Begin each section or component on a new page.<br>

        · Review the sequence: title page, abstract and key words, text, acknowledgments, 

        references, tables (each on separate page), legends.<br>

        · Illustrations, unmounted prints, should be no larger than 203 × 254 

        mm (8 × 10 inches).<br>

        · Enclose transfer of copyright and other forms.<br>

        · Submit required number of paper copies.<br>

        · Keep copies of everything submitted. 

      <p><b>Preparation of Manuscript</b></p>

      <p>The text of observational and experimental articles is usually (but not 

        necessarily) divided into sections with the headings Introduction, Methods, 

        Results, and Discussion. Long articles may need subheadings within some 

        sections (especially the Results and Discussion sections) to clarify their 

        content. Other types of articles, such as case reports, reviews, and editorials, 

        are likely to need other formats. Authors should consult individual journals 

        for further guidance.</p>

      <p>Type or print out the manuscript on white bond paper, 216 × 279 mm (8.5 

        × 11 inches), or ISO A4 (212 × 297 mm), with margins of at least 25 mm 

        (1 inch). Type or print on only one side of the paper. Use double spacing 

        throughout, including for the title page, abstract, text, acknowledgments, 

        references, individual tables, and legends. Number pages consecutively, 

        beginning with the title page. Put the page number in the upper or lower 

        right-hand corner of each page.</p>

      <p><b>Manuscripts on Disks</b></p>

      <p>For papers that are close to final acceptance, some journals require 

        authors to provide a copy in electronic form (on a disk); they may accept 

        a variety of word-processing formats or text (ASCII) files.</p>

      <p>When submitting disks, authors should:</p>

      <p>1. be certain to include a print-out of the version of the article that 

        is on the disk;<br>

        2. put only the latest version of the manuscript on the disk;<br>

        3. name the file clearly;<br>

        4. label the disk with the format of the file and the file name;<br>

        5. provide information on the hardware and software used. 

      <p>Authors should consult the journal's instructions to authors for acceptable 

        formats, conventions for naming files, number of copies to be submitted, 

        and other details.</p>

      <p><b>Title Page</b></p>

      <p>The title page should carry</p>

      <p>1) the title of the article, which should be concise but informative;<br>

        2) the name by which each author is known, with his or her highest academic 

        degree(s) and institutional affiliation;<br>

        3) the name of the department(s) and institution(s) to which the work 

        should be attributed;<br>

        4) disclaimers, if any;<br>

        5) the name and address of the author responsible for correspondence about 

        the manuscript;<br>

        6) the name and address of the author to whom requests for reprints should 

        be addressed or a statement that reprints will not be available from the 

        authors;<br>

        7) source(s) of support in the form of grants, equipment, drugs, or all 

        of these; and<br>

        8) a short running head or footline of no more than 40 characters (count 

        letters and spaces) at the foot of the title page. 

      <p><b>Authorship</b> </p>

      <p>All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship. Each 

        author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public 

        responsibility for the content.</p>

      <p>Authorship credit should be based only on substantial contributions to 

        1) conception and design, or analysis and interpretation of data; and 

        to 2) drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual 

        content; and on 3) final approval of the version to be published. Conditions 

        1, 2, and 3 must all be met. Participation solely in the acquisition of 

        funding or the collection of data does not justify authorship. General 

        supervision of the research group is not sufficient for authorship.</p>

      <p>Any part of an article critical to its main conclusions must be the responsibility 

        of at least one author.</p>

      <p>Editors may ask authors to describe what each contributed; this information 

        may be published.</p>

      <p>Increasingly, multicenter trials are attributed to a corporate author. 

        All members of the group who are named as authors, either in the authorship 

        position below the title or in a footnote, should fully meet the above 

        criteria for authorship. Group members who do not meet these criteria 

        should be listed, with their permission, in the Acknowledgments or in 

        an appendix (see Acknowledgments).</p>

      <p>The order of authorship should be a joint decision of the coauthors. 

        Because the order is assigned in different ways, its meaning cannot be 

        inferred accurately unless it is stated by the authors. Authors may wish 

        to explain the order of authorship in a footnote. In deciding on the order, 

        authors should be aware that many journals limit the number of authors 

        listed in the table of contents and that the U.S. National Library of 

        Medicine (NLM) lists in MEDLINE only the first 24 plus the last author 

        when there are more than 25 authors.</p>

      <p><b>Abstract and Key Words</b></p>

      <p>The second page should carry an abstract (of no more than 150 words for 

        unstructured abstracts or 250 words for structured abstracts). The abstract 

        should state the purposes of the study or investigation, basic procedures 

        (selection of study subjects or laboratory animals; observational and 

        analytical methods), main findings (giving specific data and their statistical 

        significance, if possible), and the principal conclusions. It should emphasize 

        new and important aspects of the study or observations.</p>

      <p>Below the abstract authors should provide, and identify as such, 3 to 

        10 key words or short phrases that will assist indexers in cross-indexing 

        the article and may be published with the abstract. Terms from the Medical 

        Subject Headings (MeSH) list of Index Medicus should be used; if suitable 

        MeSH terms are not yet available for recently introduced terms, present 

        terms may be used.</p>

      <p><b>Introduction</b></p>

      <p>State the purpose of the article and summarize the rationale for the 

        study or observation. Give only strictly pertinent references and do not 

        include data or conclusions from the work being reported.</p>

      <p><b>Methods</b></p>

      <p>Describe your selection of the observational or experimental subjects 

        (patients or laboratory animals, including controls) clearly. Identify 

        the age, sex, and other important characteristics of the subjects. The 

        definition and relevance of race and ethnicity are ambiguous. Authors 

        should be particularly careful about using these categories.</p>

      <p>Identify the methods, apparatus (give the manufacturer's name and address 

        in parentheses), and procedures in sufficient detail to allow other workers 

        to reproduce the results. Give references to established methods, including 

        statistical methods (see below); provide references and brief descriptions 

        for methods that have been published but are not well known; describe 

        new or substantially modified methods, give reasons for using them, and 

        evaluate their limitations. Identify precisely all drugs and chemicals 

        used, including generic name(s), dose(s), and route(s) of administration.</p>

      <p>Reports of randomized clinical trials should present information on all 

        major study elements, including the protocol (study population, interventions 

        or exposures, outcomes, and the rationale for statistical analysis), assignment 

        of interventions (methods of randomization, concealment of allocation 

        to treatment groups), and the method of masking (blinding).</p>

      <p>Authors submitting review manuscripts should include a section describing 

        the methods used for locating, selecting, extracting, and synthesizing 

        data. These methods should also be summarized in the abstract.</p>

      <p><b>Ethics</b></p>

      <p>When reporting experiments on human subjects, indicate whether the procedures 

        followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible 

        committee on human experimentation (institutional or regional) and with 

        the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 1983. Do not use patients' 

        names, initials, or hospital numbers, especially in illustrative material. 

        When reporting experiments on animals, indicate whether the institution's 

        or a national research council's guide for, or any national law on, the 

        care and use of laboratory animals was followed.</p>

      <p><b>Statistics</b> </p>

      <p>Describe statistical methods with enough detail to enable a knowledgeable 

        reader with access to the original data to verify the reported results. 

        When possible, quantify findings and present them with appropriate indicators 

        of measurement error or uncertainty (such as confidence intervals). Avoid 

        relying solely on statistical hypothesis testing, such as the use of P 

        values, which fails to convey important quantitative information. Discuss 

        the eligibility of experimental subjects. Give details about randomization. 

        Describe the methods for and success of any blinding of observations. 

        Report complications of treatment. Give numbers of observations. Report 

        losses to observation (such as dropouts from a clinical trial). References 

        for the design of the study and statistical methods should be to standard 

        works when possible (with pages stated) rather than to papers in which 

        the designs or methods were originally reported. Specify any general-use 

        computer programs used.</p>

      <p>Put a general description of methods in the Methods section. When data 

        are summarized in the Results section, specify the statistical methods 

        used to analyze them. Restrict tables and figures to those needed to explain 

        the argument of the paper and to assess its support. Use graphs as an 

        alternative to tables with many entries; do not duplicate data in graphs 

        and tables. Avoid nontechnical uses of technical terms in statistics, 

        such as "random" (which implies a randomizing device), "normal," "significant," 

        "correlations," and "sample." Define statistical terms, abbreviations, 

        and most symbols.</p>

      <p><b>Results</b></p>

      <p>Present your results in logical sequence in the text, tables, and illustrations. 

        Do not repeat in the text all the data in the tables or illustrations; 

        emphasize or summarize only important observations.</p>

      <p><b>Discussion</b></p>

      <p>Emphasize the new and important aspects of the study and the conclusions 

        that follow from them. Do not repeat in detail data or other material 

        given in the Introduction or the Results section. Include in the Discussion 

        section the implications of the findings and their limitations, including 

        implications for future research. Relate the observations to other relevant 

        studies.</p>

      <p>Link the conclusions with the goals of the study but avoid unqualified 

        statements and conclusions not completely supported by the data. In particular, 

        authors should avoid making statements on economic benefits and costs 

        unless their manuscript includes economic data and analyses. Avoid claiming 

        priority and alluding to work that has not been completed. State new hypotheses 

        when warranted, but clearly label them as such. Recommendations, when 

        appropriate, may be included.</p>

      <p><b>Acknowledgments</b></p>

      <p>At an appropriate place in the article (the title-page footnote or an 

        appendix to the text; see the journal's requirements), one or more statements 

        should specify 1) contributions that need acknowledging but do not justify 

        authorship, such as general support by a departmental chair; 2) acknowledgments 

        of technical help; 3) acknowledgments of financial and material support, 

        which should specify the nature of the support; and 4) relationships that 

        may pose a conflict of interest (see Conflict of Interest).</p>

      <p>Persons who have contributed intellectually to the paper but whose contributions 

        do not justify authorship may be named and their function or contribution 

        described-for example, "scientific adviser," "critical review of study 

        proposal," "data collection," or "participation in clinical trial." Such 

        persons must have given their permission to be named. Authors are responsible 

        for obtaining written permission from persons acknowledged by name, because 

        readers may infer their endorsement of the data and conclusions.</p>

      <p>Technical help should be acknowledged in a paragraph separate from that 

        acknowledging other contributions.</p>

      <p><b>References</b></p>

      <p>References should be numbered consecutively in the order in which they 

        are first mentioned in the text. Identify references in text, tables, 

        and legends by Arabic numerals in parentheses. References cited only in 

        tables or figure legends should be numbered in accordance with the sequence 

        established by the first identification in the text of the particular 

        table or figure.</p>

      <p>Use the style of the examples below, which are based on the formats used 

        by the NLM in Index Medicus. The titles of journals should be abbreviated 

        according to the style used in Index Medicus. Consult the List of Journals 

        Indexed in Index Medicus, published annually as a separate publication 

        by the library and as a list in the January issue of Index Medicus. The 

        list can also be obtained through the library's web site (<a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov">http://www.nlm.nih.gov</a>).</p>

      <p>Avoid using abstracts as references. References to papers accepted but 

        not yet published should be designated as "in press" or "forthcoming"; 

        authors should obtain written permission to cite such papers as well as 

        verification that they have been accepted for publication. Information 

        from manuscripts submitted but not accepted should be cited in the text 

        as "unpublished observations" with written permission from the source.</p>

      <p>Avoid citing a "personal communication" unless it provides essential 

        information not available from a public source, in which case the name 

        of the person and date of communication should be cited in parentheses 

        in the text. For scientific articles, authors should obtain written permission 

        and confirmation of accuracy from the source of a personal communication.</p>

      <p>The references must be verified by the author(s) against the original 

        documents.</p>

      <p>The Uniform Requirements style (the Vancouver style) is based largely 

        on an ANSI standard style adapted by the NLM for its databases. Notes 

        have been added where Vancouver style differs from the style now used 

        by NLM.</p>

      <p><b>Tables</b></p>

      <p>Type or print out each table with double spacing on a separate sheet 

        of paper. Do not submit tables as photographs. Number tables consecutively 

        in the order of their first citation in the text and supply a brief title 

        for each. Give each column a short or abbreviated heading. Place explanatory 

        matter in footnotes, not in the heading. Explain in footnotes all nonstandard 

        abbreviations that are used in each table. For footnotes use the following 

        symbols, in this sequence:</p>

      <p>Identify statistical measures of variations, such as standard deviation 

        and standard error of the mean.</p>

      <p>Do not use internal horizontal and vertical rules.</p>

      <p>Be sure that each table is cited in the text.</p>

      <p>If you use data from another published or unpublished source, obtain 

        permission and acknowledge them fully.</p>

      <p>The use of too many tables in relation to the length of the text may 

        produce difficulties in the layout of pages. Examine issues of the journal 

        to which you plan to submit your paper to estimate how many tables can 

        be used per 1000 words of text.</p>

      <p>The editor, on accepting a paper, may recommend that additional tables 

        containing important backup data too extensive to publish be deposited 

        with an archival service, such as the National Auxiliary Publication Service 

        in the United States, or made available by the authors. In that event 

        an appropriate statement will be added to the text. Submit such tables 

        for consideration with the paper.</p>

      <p><b>Illustrations (Figures)</b></p>

      <p>Submit the required number of complete sets of figures. Figures should 

        be professionally drawn and photographed; freehand or typewritten lettering 

        is unacceptable. Instead of original drawings, x-ray films, and other 

        material, send sharp, glossy, black-and-white photographic prints, usually 

        127 × 173 mm (5 × 7 inches) but no larger than 203 × 254 mm (8 × 10 inches). 

        Letters, numbers, and symbols should be clear and even throughout and 

        of sufficient size that when reduced for publication each item will still 

        be legible. Titles and detailed explanations belong in the legends for 

        illustrations not on the illustrations themselves.</p>

      <p>Each figure should have a label pasted on its back indicating the number 

        of the figure, author's name, and top of the figure. Do not write on the 

        back of figures or scratch or mar them by using paper clips. Do not bend 

        figures or mount them on cardboard.</p>

      <p>Photomicrographs should have internal scale markers. Symbols, arrows, 

        or letters used in photomicrographs should contrast with the background.</p>

      <p>If photographs of people are used, either the subjects must not be identifiable 

        or their pictures must be accompanied by written permission to use the 

        photograph (see Protection of Patients' Rights to Privacy).</p>

      <p>Figures should be numbered consecutively according to the order in which 

        they have been first cited in the text. If a figure has been published, 

        acknowledge the original source and submit written permission from the 

        copyright holder to reproduce the material. Permission is required irrespective 

        of authorship or publisher except for documents in the public domain.</p>

      <p>For illustrations in color, ascertain whether the journal requires color 

        negatives, positive transparencies, or color prints. Accompanying drawings 

        marked to indicate the region to be reproduced may be useful to the editor. 

        Some journals publish illustrations in color only if the author pays for 

        the extra cost.</p>

      <p><b>Legends for Illustrations</b> </p>

      <p>Type or print out legends for illustrations using double spacing, starting 

        on a separate page, with Arabic numerals corresponding to the illustrations. 

        When symbols, arrows, numbers, or letters are used to identify parts of 

        the illustrations, identify and explain each one clearly in the legend. 

        Explain the internal scale and identify the method of staining in photomicrographs.</p>

      <p><b>Units of Measurement</b></p>

      <p>Measurements of length, height, weight, and volume should be reported 

        in metric units (meter, kilogram, or liter) or their decimal multiples.</p>

      <p>Temperatures should be given in degrees Celsius. Blood pressures should

      <p><b>Definition of a Peer-Reviewed Journal</b></p>

      <p>A peer-reviewed journal is one that has submitted most of its published 

        articles for review by experts who are not part of the editorial staff. 

        The number and kind of manuscripts sent for review, the number of reviewers, 

        the reviewing procedures, and the use made of the reviewers' opinions 

        may vary, and therefore each journal should publicly disclose its policies 

        in its instructions to authors for the benefit of readers and potential 

        authors.</p>

      <p><b>Editorial Freedom and Integrity</b> </p>

      <p>Owners and editors of medical journals have a common endeavor-the publication 

        of a reliable and readable journal, produced with due respect for the 

        stated aims of the journal and for costs. The functions of owners and 

        editors, however, are different. Owners have the right to appoint and 

        dismiss editors and to make important business decisions in which editors 

        should be involved to the fullest extent possible. Editors must have full 

        authority for determining the editorial content of the journal. This concept 

        of editorial freedom should be resolutely defended by editors even to 

        the extent of their placing their positions at stake. To secure this freedom 

        in practice, the editor should have direct access to the highest level 

        of ownership, not only to a delegated manager.</p>

      <p>Editors of medical journals should have a contract that clearly states 

        the editor's rights and duties in addition to the general terms of the 

        appointment and that defines mechanisms for resolving conflict.</p>

      <p>An independent editorial advisory board may be useful in helping the 

        editor establish and maintain editorial policy.</p>

      <p>All editors and editors' organizations have the obligation to support 

        the concept of editorial freedom and to draw major transgressions of such 

        freedom to the attention of the international medical community.</p>

      <p>Conflict of interest for a given manuscript exists when a participant 

        in the peer review and publication process-author, reviewer, and editor-has 

        ties to activities that could inappropriately influence his or her judgment, 

        whether or not judgment is in fact affected. Financial relationships with 

        industry (for example, through employment, consultancies, stock ownership, 

        honoraria, expert testimony), either directly or through immediate family, 

        are usually considered to be the most important conflicts of interest. 

        However, conflicts can occur for other reasons, such as personal relationships, 

        academic competition, and intellectual passion.</p>

      <p>Public trust in the peer review process and the credibility of published 

        articles depend in part on how well conflict of interest is handled during 

        writing, peer review, and editorial decision making. Bias can often be 

        identified and eliminated by careful attention to the scientific methods 

        and conclusions of the work. Financial relationships and their effects 

        are less easily detected than other conflicts of interest. Participants 

        in peer review and publication should disclose their conflicting interests, 

        and the information should be made available so that others can judge 

        their effects for themselves. Because readers may be less able to detect 

        bias in review articles and editorials than in reports of original research, 

        some journals do not accept reviews and editorials from authors with a 

        conflict of interest.</p>

        connections to the work.</p>

      <p><b>Reviewers</b></p>

      <p>External peer reviewers should disclose to editors any conflicts of interest 

        that could bias their opinions of the manuscript, and they should disqualify 

        themselves from reviewing specific manuscripts if they believe it to be 

        appropriate. The editors must be made aware of reviewers' conflicts of 

        interest to interpret the reviews and judge for themselves whether the 

        reviewer should be disqualified. Reviewers should not use knowledge of 

        the work, before its publication, to further their own interests.</p>

      <p><b>Editors and Staff</b></p>

      <p>Editors must assume initially that authors are reporting work based on 

        honest observations. Nevertheless, two types of difficulty may arise.</p>

      <p>First, errors may be noted in published articles that require the publication 

        of a correction or erratum of part of the work. It is conceivable that 

        an error could be so serious as to vitiate the entire body of the work, 

        but this is unlikely and should be handled by editors and authors on an 

        individual basis. Such an error should not be confused with inadequacies 

        exposed by the emergence of new scientific information in the normal course 

        of research. The latter require no corrections or withdrawals.</p>

      <p>The second type of difficulty is scientific fraud. If substantial doubts 

        arise about the honesty of work, either submitted or published, it is 

        the editor's responsibility to ensure that the question is appropriately 

        pursued (including possible consultation with the authors). However, it 

        is not the task of editors to conduct a full investigation or to make 

        a determination; that responsibility lies with the institution where the 

        work was done or with the funding agency. The editor should be promptly 

        informed of the final decision, and if a fraudulent paper has been published, 

        the journal must print a retraction. If this method of investigation does 

        not result in a satisfactory conclusion, the editor may choose to publish 

        an expression of concern with an explanation.</p>

      <p>The retraction or expression of concern, so labeled, should appear on 

        a numbered page in a prominent section of the journal, be listed in the 

        contents page, and include in its heading the title of the original article. 

        It should not simply be a letter to the editor. Ideally, the first author 

        should be the same in the retraction as in the article, although under 

        certain circumstances the editor may accept retractions by other responsible 

        people. The text of the retraction should explain why the article is being 

        retracted and include a bibliographic reference to it.</p>

      <p>The validity of previous work by the author of a fraudulent paper cannot 

        be assumed. Editors may ask the author's institution to assure them of 

        the validity of earlier work published in their journals or to retract 

        it. If this is not done they may choose to publish an announcement to 

        the effect that the validity of previously published work is not assured.</p>

      <p>Manuscripts should be reviewed with due respect for authors' confidentiality. 

        In submitting their manuscripts for review, authors entrust editors with 

        the results of their scientific work and creative effort, on which their 

        reputation and career may depend. Authors' rights may be violated by disclosure 

        of the confidential details of the review of their manuscript. Reviewers 

        also have rights to confidentiality, which must be respected by the editor. 

        Confidentiality may have to be breached if dishonesty or fraud is alleged 

        but otherwise must be honored.</p>

      <p>Editors should not disclose information about manuscripts (including 

        their receipt, their content, their status in the reviewing process, their 

        criticism by reviewers, or their ultimate fate) to anyone other than the 

        authors themselves and reviewers.</p>

      <p>Editors should make clear to their reviewers that manuscripts sent for 

        review are privileged communications and are the private property of the 

        authors. Therefore, reviewers and members of the editorial staff should 

        respect the authors' rights by not publicly discussing the authors' work 

        or appropriating their ideas before the manuscript is published. Reviewer 

        s should not be allowed to make copies of the manuscript for their files 

        and should be prohibited from sharing it with others, except with the 

        permission of the editor. Editors should not keep copies of rejected manuscripts.</p>

      <p>Opinions differ on whether reviewers should remain anonymous. Some editors 

        require their reviewers to sign the comments returned to authors, but 

        most either request that reviewers' comments not be signed or leave the 

        choice to the reviewer. When comments are not signed the reviewers' identity 

        must not be revealed to the author or anyone else.</p>

      <p>Some journals publish reviewers' comments with the manuscript. No such 

        procedure should be adopted without the consent of the authors and reviewers. 

        However, reviewers' comments may be sent to other reviewers of the same 

        manuscript, and reviewers may be notified of the editor's decision.</p>

      <p>The public's interest in news of medical research has led the popular 

        media to compete vigorously to get information about research as soon 

        as possible. Researchers and institutions sometimes encourage the reporting 

        of research in the popular media before full publication in a scientific 

        journal by holding a press conference or giving interviews.</p>

      <p>The public is entitled to important medical information without unreasonable 

        delay, and editors have a responsibility to play their part in this process. 

        Doctors, however, need to have reports available in full detail before 

        they can advise their patients about the reports' conclusions. In addition, 

        media reports of scientific research before the work has been peer reviewed 

        and fully published may lead to the dissemination of inaccurate or premature 

        conclusions.</p>

      <p>Editors may find the following recommendations useful as they seek to 

        establish policies on these issues.</p>

      <p>1. Editors can foster the orderly transmission of medical information 

        from researchers, through peer-reviewed journals, to the public. This 

        can be accomplished by an agreement with authors that they will not publicize 

        their work while their manuscript is under consideration or awaiting publication 

        and an agreement with the media that they will not release stories before 

        publication in the journal, in return for which the journal will cooperate 

        with them in preparing accurate stories (see below).</p>

      <p>2. Very little medical research has such clear and urgently important 

        clinical implications for the public's health that the news must be released 

        before full publication in a journal. In such exceptional circumstances, 

        however, appropriate authorities responsible for public health should 

        make the decision and should be responsible for the advance dissemination 

        of information to physicians and the media. If the author and the appropriate 

        authorities wish to have a manuscript considered by a particular journal, 

        the editor should be consulted before any public release. If editors accept 

        the need for immediate release, they should waive their policies limiting 

        prepublication publicity.</p>

      <p>3. Policies designed to limit prepublication publicity should not apply 

        to accounts in the media of presentations at scientific meetings or to 

        the abstracts from these meetings (see Redundant or Duplicate Publication). 

        Researchers who present their work at a scientific meeting should feel 

        free to discuss their presentations with reporters, but they should be 

        discouraged from offering more detail about their study than was presented 

        in their talk.</p>

      <p>4. When an article is soon to be published, editors may wish to help 

        the media prepare accurate reports by providing news releases, answering 

        questions, supplying advance copies of the journal, or referring reporters 

        to the appropriate experts. This assistance should be contingent on the 

        media's cooperation in timing their release of stories to coincide with 

        the publication of the article.</p>

      <p>Most medical journals carry advertising, which generates income for their 

        publishers, but advertising must not be allowed to influence editorial 

        decisions. Editors must have full responsibility for advertising policy. 

        Readers should be able to distinguish readily between advertising and 

        editorial material. The juxtaposition of editorial and advertising material 

        on the same products or subjects should be avoided, and advertising should 

        not be sold on the condition that it will appear in the same issue as 

        a particular article.</p>

      <p>Journals should not be dominated by advertising, but editors should be 

        careful about publishing advertisements from only one or two advertisers 

        as readers may perceive that the editor has been influenced by these advertisers.</p>

      <p>Journals should not carry advertisements for products that have proved 

        to be seriously harmful to health-for example, tobacco. Editors should 

        ensure that existing standards for advertisements are enforced or develop 

        their own standards. Finally, editors should consider all criticisms of 

        advertisements for publication.</p>

        exchange of research information, ease of access to focused content, and 

        improved cooperation between academic and corporate entities. Because

        to reject papers.</p>

        should be clearly stated and prominently located in the supplement, preferably 

        on each page. Whenever possible, funding should come from more than one 

        sponsor.</p>

      <p>3. Advertising in supplements should follow the same policies as those 

        of the rest of the journal.</p>

      <p>4. Editors should enable readers to distinguish readily between ordinary 

        editorial pages and supplement pages.</p>

      <p>5. Editing by the funding organization should not be permitted.</p>

      <p>6. Journal editors and supplement editors should not accept personal 

        favors or excessive compensation from sponsors of supplements.</p>

      <p>7. Secondary publication in supplements should be clearly identified 

        by the citation of the original paper. Redundant publication should be 

        avoided.</p>

    <td width="70%">All biomedical journals should have a section carrying comments, 

      questions, or criticisms about articles they have published and where the 

      original authors can respond. Usually, but not necessarily, this may take 

      the form of a correspondence column. The lack of such a section denies readers 

      the possibility of responding to articles in the same journal that published 

      the original work.</td>

      <p>Editors may receive manuscripts from different authors offering competing 

        interpretations of the same study. They have to decide whether to review 

        competing manuscripts submitted to them more or less simultaneously by 

        different groups or authors, or they may be asked to consider one such 

        manuscript while a competing manuscript has been or will be submitted 

        to another journal. Setting aside the unresolved question of ownership 

        of data, we discuss here what editors ought to do when confronted with 

        the submission of competing manuscripts based on the same study.</p>

      <p>Two kinds of multiple submissions are considered: submissions by coworkers 

        who disagree on the analysis and interpretation of their study, and submissions 

        by coworkers who disagree on what the facts are and which data should 

        be reported.</p>

      <p>The following general observations may help editors and others dealing 

        with this problem.</p>

      <p>Journals would not normally wish to publish separate articles by contending 

        members of a research team who have differing analyses and interpretations 

        of the data, and submission of such manuscripts should be discouraged. 

        If coworkers cannot resolve their differences in interpretation before 

        submitting a manuscript, they should consider submitting one manuscript 

        containing multiple interpretations and calling their dispute to the attention 

        of the editor so that reviewers can focus on the problem. One of the important 

        functions of peer review is to evaluate the authors' analysis and interpretation 

        and to suggest appropriate changes to the conclusions before publication. 

        Alternatively, after the disputed version is published, editors may wish 

        to consider a letter to the editor or a second manuscript from the dissenting 

        authors. Multiple submissions present editors with a dilemma. Publication 

        of contending manuscripts to air authors' disputes may waste journal space 

        and confuse readers. On the other hand, if editors knowingly publish a 

        manuscript written by only some of the collaborating team, they could 

        be denying the rest of the team their legitimate coauthorship rights.</p>

      <p>Workers sometimes differ in their opinions about what was actually done 

        or observed and which data ought to be reported. Peer review cannot be 

        expected to resolve this problem. Editors should decline further consideration 

        of such multiple submissions until the problem is settled. Furthermore, 

        if there are allegations of dishonesty or fraud, editors should inform 

        the appropriate authorities. The cases described above should be distinguished 

        from instances in which independent, non-collaborating authors submit 

        separate manuscripts based on different analyses of data that are publicly 

        available. In this circumstance, editorial consideration of multiple submissions 

        may be justified, and there may even be a good reason f or publishing 

        more than one manuscript because different analytical approaches may be 

        complementary and equally valid.</p>
