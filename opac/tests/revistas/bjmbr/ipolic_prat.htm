      <p>The <i>Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research</i> is published 

        by the Brazilian Association of Scientific Divulgation (ABDC). Three Editors-in-Chief 

        are appointed by the ABDC Council upon recommendation of the Deliberative 

        Committee for a term of two years. The Editors nominates Section Editors 

        that are appointed in recognition of their long-term service as effective 

        reviewers of manuscripts. The Editors are responsible for the specific 

        editorial conduct of the <i>Brazilian Journal</i>. The Deliberative Committee

      <p>The purpose of the <i>Brazilian Journal</i> is to publish the results 

        of original research which contribute significantly to knowledge in medical 

        and biological sciences. Major criteria for acceptance are scientific 

        quality, originality, and conciseness. Preference will be given to manuscripts 

        that develop new concepts or experimental approaches and are not merely 

        repositories of scientific data. Methodological papers shall be considered 

        for publication provided they describe new principles or a significant 

        improvement of existing methods. Papers that report preliminary results 

        or are only confirmatory in nature will not be accepted for publication.</p>

      <p>Holding positions of administrative leadership, contributing patients, 

        and collecting and assembling data, however important to the research, 

        are not, by themselves, criteria for authorship. Other persons who have 

        made substantial, direct contributions to the work but cannot be considered 

        authors should be acknowledged with their permission (see Authors' Form, 

        below); description of their specific contributions is encouraged. The 

        authors must also affirm that no other names of persons who contributed 

        significantly to the work have been omitted from the acknowledgments. 

      <p>To assist us in developing a system for identifying the roles of those 

        who participated in the creation of a manuscript, the specific contributions 

        of all authors, as well as those listed in the acknowledgments, should

      <p>All manuscript will be acknowledged and assigned a unique number. After 

        a manuscript is received, it is assigned by the Editors to a specific 

        Section Editor whose expertise is considered to be appropriate. The Section 

        Editor prepares a list of expert reviewers, which may include some suggested 

        by the Editors. Authors can indicate specific individuals whom they would 

        like to have excluded as reviewers as well as individuals thought to be 

        particularly appropriate reviewers (five persons), although these suggestions 

        may not always be accepted. Generally, requests to exclude certain potential 

        reviewers will be honored; however, in fields with a limited number of 

        experts, a request for exclusion solely on the basis of "competition" 

        may be difficult to honor. The <i>Brazilian Journal</i> maintains a list 

        of qualified primary reviewers who have agreed to review a limited number 

        of manuscripts without the need for giving prior approval. All other potential 

        reviewers are contacted individually to determine availability. Copies 

        of the manuscript are sent to at least two expert reviewers. Reviewers 

        are asked to complete the review of the manuscript within 3-4 weeks; to 

        assign a priority based on content, originality, quality, relevance, and 

        interest; and to send a short review form to the Section Editor by E-mail,&nbsp; 

        by Fax or mail. The Section Editor reconciles the opinions of the reviewers, 

        providing an independent opinion when appropriate, and recommends a course 

        of action and communicates the reviews and recommendations to the Editors 

        by E-mail or Fax.<br>

      <p>Selection of reviewers is the responsability of the Section Editor, although 

        the Editors makes recommendations to the Section Editor from the list 

        of individuals who have reviewed manuscripts previously. This database 

        of previous reviewers includes the self-identified areas of expertise 

        as well as information about the perceived usefulness and timeliness of 

        past reviews. Individuals who consistently have provided tardy reviews 

        or reviews that have not been helpful are removed from the database. The 

        intent is to identify individuals who are the most competent in the central 

        issues being addressed in the manuscript and to insure that the review 

        process is completed in a timely fashion. Every effort is made to avoid 

        both real and apparent conflicts of interest with respect to research 

        activities or collaborative or personal interactions, and reviewers are 

        asked to withdraw from considering any manuscript in which they identify 

        a conflict that has escaped the attention of the Section Editor or Editors. 

        Definition of conflict of interest is arbitrary, but for the purposes 

        of the Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research, it includes 

        but is not limited to current or recent collaboration, institutional affiliation, 

        and recent mentor-trainee relations.</p>

      <p>Information contained in manuscripts is considered confidential and should 

        not be shared or distributed. If necessary, a reviewer can consult with 

        others for an adequate evaluation of the research findings provided that 

        all individuals involved maintain confidentiality, objectivity, and avoid 

        conflict of interest. Brazilian Journal is not responsible for acts and 

        conduct by reviewers that are not in accordance with accepted professional 

        standards. Reviewers must assure that their conduct before, during, and 

        after a review meets the highest standards of ethical behavior. By accepting 

        to perform a review, a reviewer holds Brazilian Journal harmless from 

        any and all liabilities that may be caused by unethical or unprofessional 

        conduct. Reviewers are asked to be objective in their evaluations and 

        to judge primarily the novelty and soundness of the information presented. 

        Although reviews are anonymous, all comments should be capable of withstanding 

        public scrutiny.</p>

      <p>The Section Editors considers the comments made by the reviewers and 

        their recommendation, selects those comments to be shared with the authors, 

        makes a final decision concerning the manuscript, and prepares the decision 

        letter for signature. If revisions of the manuscript are suggested, the&nbsp; 

        Section Editors also recommends the process by which the revised manuscript 

        will be reviewed again. The Section Editors signs all&nbsp; letters, and&nbsp; 

        make the final decision regarding the suitability of a manuscript for 

        publication in the <i>Brazilian Journal</i>. The Editors and Section Editors 

        try to meet in person at least once a year and communicate frequently 

        by conference call or by e-mail in an attempt to insure that the criteria 

        used to evaluate manuscripts are applied as uniformly as possible. Personal 

        interactions among Section Editors and the Editors are encouraged to resolve 

        concerns about any individual manuscript. Authors are informed of the 

        final decision by E-mail, mail,or Fax; appropriate comments from reviewers 

        and editors are appended.</p>

      <p>The primary criteria for judging the acceptability of a manuscript are 

        its originality and scientific importance. Manuscripts judged lacking 

        in these respects will be declined, even if the experimental work appears 

        technically sound. This policy permits declination of a manuscript solely 

        on the judgment of the Editors that the studies reported are insufficiently 

        original and important to merit publication in the <i>Brazilian</i> <i>Journal</i>. 

        If there are a number of serious concerns raised in the initial review 

        by a member of the Editorial Board and a manuscript is not recommended 

        by the Board member for publication, the Associate Editor can decline 

        it without further review. The Associate Editor may also seek a second 

        opinion from another Editorial Board member or an expert referee but is 

        not obligated to do so.</p>

      <p>Occasionally manuscripts do not require changes. Some manuscripts are 

        accepted provisionally, pending relatively minor revisions. For many manuscripts, 

        authors are invited to resubmit if major criticisms can be addressed by 

        revision and/or additional experimentation. All revised manuscripts are 

        carefully reexamined, and ultimate acceptability is not guaranteed. (To 

        avoid prolonged disruptive negotiations, only one major revision of each 

        manuscript is considered.) A revised manuscript not returned within six 

        months of the date of the decision letter will be considered as a new 

        manuscript and will be subjected to a complete review. A statement signed 

        by the corresponding author<font 



  color=#3366ff> </font>must accompany revised manuscripts, indicating that all 

        authors have approved the revisions and that no substantial part of the 

        manuscript is under consideration (or already published) elsewhere. All 

        of the concerns must be addressed in a point-by-point reply to the individually 

        referees' comments.&nbsp; The author are asked to answer on separate sheets 

        all the suggestions made by the reviewers, indicating those that were 

        accepted and introduced in the text and justifying the decision when the 

        author did not agree&nbsp; with a given suggestion (4 copies). A list 

        of all changes introduced in the new text (4 copies) and four copies of 

        the revised manuscript must be included. In the case of minor revision, 

        the Section Editor may conduct the review. In the case of major revisions, 

        one or more reviewers may be asked to consider adequacy of the revisions. 

        A checklist provided for re-submission insures that all other relevant 

        issues are dealt with, avoiding delays later in the process.</p>

      <p>If the authors believe that a serious scientific error occurred during 

        the review, a letter of rebuttal may be sent to the Editors, explaining 

        the reasons why the decision should be reconsidered. When appropriate, 

        the matter will be taken up with the Editor, Section Editor, and/or additional 

        reviewers. Rebuttals that challenge rejections based upon priority alone 

        are rarely successful, since the assignment of priority is necessarily 

        a matter of opinion. A small proportion of rebuttals are successful in 

        reversing the original decision. However, disposition of rebuttals cannot 

        take precedence over the timely handling of manuscripts in review and 

        therefore may take significant time to be resolved.</p>

      <p>If the authors of a rejected manuscript are able to make new advances 

        that go far beyond the original submission, they may consider submitting 

        the manuscript for a completely new review. A new submission form is required, 

        and the manuscript will be assigned a new number.</p>

      <p>The Editorial Office strives to minimize the time from submission to 

        first decision. However, this varies widely between individual manuscripts 

        and delays can occur for many unforeseen reasons. The most common delay 

        occurs when a reviewer takes an inordinately long time in reviewing the 

        manuscript or decides not to carry out a review. The <i>Brazilian Journal</i> 

        makes every effort to avoid these situations. However, authors must recognize 

        that manuscript review is a completely voluntary service for the Journal. 

        Therefore, the Editorial Office can only determine willingness to conduct 

        a review, request a prompt review, and remind reviewers when they are 

        tardy. However, if a reviewer does not respond after timely reminders, 

        an additional review will be solicited or an independent review will be 

        provided by the Section Editor. In such instances, the Editors will also 

        review the manuscript. Once a paper is accepted, every effort is made 

        to publish it as soon as possible.</p>

      <p>Manuscripts submitted from the institution of any of the Section Editors 

        are handled by other Section Editors from outside that institution. The 

        Editorial Office insures confidentiality and makes certain that these 

        manuscripts are handled in a similar manner to those from other authors.</p>

      <p>Questions concerning manuscript status are best handled by the <i>Brazilian 

        Journal</i> office staff via fax or e-mail; the Journal requests that 

        telephone calls should be avoided if possible. To minimize the possibility 

        of misinterpretation and/or errors in verbal communication, the office 

        staff will provide information only to the corresponding author and will 

        not provide extensive details (e.g., exact status of review or a predicted 

        time to final decision). Editors do not take calls from authors concerning 

        decisions or other related matters. All such inquiries should be addressed 

        to the Editors in writing. The issues will be discussed by the Editors 

        and the Section Editor, and will then communicate with the authors as 

        appropriate. Although the Editors is willing to discuss issues of concern 

        to authors, verbal communication in the absence of prior written documentation 

        of concerns (except for simple questions concerning manuscript status) 

        is discouraged. This policy has been established to provide for uniformity 

        and fairness in addressing concerns about the review process. It also 

        provides a written record should other editors and/or office staff have 

        to handle the manuscript later.</p>

      <p>More widespread publicity is legitimate for some articles published in 

        the <i>Brazilian Journal</i>, as well as the authors may benefit from 

        such publicity if it is appropriate, accurate, and occurs at a suitable 

        time. However, the public release of information should not precede the 

        actual publication of the work (defined as the date the first copy is 

        mailed from our publisher) for manuscripts approved for publication and 

        considered to be "in press". This embargo policy protects the peer-review 

        process, the newsworthiness of the scientific content of published articles, 

        and minimizes the chance for the appearance in the lay press of misinformation 

        relating to those articles. Importantly, this policy also ensures that 

        scientists have access to all relevant information at the same time the 

        general public is made aware of it. Obviously, these restrictions cannot 

        apply to the presentation of the work at scientific conferences or symposia 

        that precede the actual publication date. Although news reporters may 

        be present at such meetings or symposia, information, tables, or illustrations 

        that in any way duplicate the content of a manuscript submitted for publication 

        or "in press" should not be provided to reporters by the authors. In particular, 

        press conferences should not be held prior to the embargo date. The official 

        release of videotape presentations and electronic prepublication of articles 

        on the Internet should also adhere to the embargo policy. Violation of 

        these policies are legitimate grounds for withdrawal of the manuscript 

        from publication and/or other measures that the <i>Brazilian Journal</i> 

        may choose to take. This policy will be modified, as needed, to adjust 

        to the realities of electronic publication.</p>

      <p>Duplicate publication and scientific fraud are uncommon events that have 

        a very serious impact on the scientific community. In case of possible 

        scientific misconduct, i.e., suspected fabrication or falsification of 

        data, double publication, or plagiarism, the Editors will attempt to clarify 

        the matter with each of the authors. Should that fail to resolve the situation 

        satisfactorily, the Editors will contact the institution of the corresponding 

        author. The institution should then make an inquiry and report back to 

        the Editors. Until the matter is clarified, no papers by any authors on 

        the disputed manuscript will be considered for publication. If scientific 

        misconduct is confirmed by institutional review, the Section Editors will 

        report this to the Editors. Appropriate action will be decided by the 

        Editors in consultation with the Council of the ABDC.</p>

      <p>A lesser problem arises when a member of the scientific community disagrees 

        strongly with the methodology and/or conclusions of an article that has 

        been published in the <i>Brazilian Journal </i>but does not allege actual 

        fraud. The <i>Brazilian Journal</i> does not have a forum to publish a 

        communication regarding such issues; therefore, the concerned individual 

        should either contact the authors directly to discuss the disagreement, 

        or allow the natural corrective mechanisms of science to settle the issue 

        with time.</p>

      <p>Clearly, the peer review process has its inherent flaws, and the outcome 

        of a manuscript review may not always be equitable from the perspective 

        of the author. However, in the absence of a better system, review of manuscripts 

        by scientific peers appears to be the best method for maintaining standards 

        of excellence for research publications by the scientific community. The 

        Brazilian Journal is firmly committed to promoting the quality and fairness, 

        as well as the speed and efficiency, of this process in every way possible. 

        The Section Editors and the Editors welcome suggestions from the scientific 

        community on ways to improve this process and to sustain the excellence 

        of the <i>Brazilian Journal</i>.
