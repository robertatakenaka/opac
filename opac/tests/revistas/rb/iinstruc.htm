    <p><strong>Note on authorship:</strong> Except for multicentre studies or those  of outstanding complexity, the Journal considers eight (8) as the maximum  acceptable number of authors for Original Articles, six (6) for Review Articles  and Iconographic Essays, and five (5) for Letters to the Editor and News in  Radiology.<br>
Materials  submitted for publication must be unpublished, and must not be under  consideration for publication by other journals. Articles written in Portuguese  must comply with the official orthography. When originated from foreign  institutions, they may be published in English.</p>
    <p>Articles  will be initially reviewed by the editors regarding the minimum <strong>Radiologia  Brasileira</strong> standards<strong>, </strong>and the compliance with all requirements  concerning submission of original manuscripts. After that the editors will  submit the article to the scrutiny of two peer reviewers, specialists in the  concerned area, selected from the Editorial Board and/or from the accredited  reviewers body of the Journal. The reviewers always come from institutions  different from those in which the manuscripts were originated, and will not be  informed about authors’ identities and institutions where the manuscript was  originated. The opinions expressed in the articles, including changes made by  the editors, are sole responsibility of the authors.</p></td>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> A complete list of examples of bibliographic  citations can be found at: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7256/">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7256/</a>.</p>
      <p>References  corresponding to abstracts, editorials and letters shall be registered as such.  It is the author's responsibility that all references are precisely listed.</p>
      <p>Unpublished  data and personal communications should not be included in the references list,  but may be mentioned on the text in parenthesis: (Smith DJ, personal  communication), (Brown AC, unpublished data). These data include articles  submitted but not yet accepted for publication.</p>
      <p><strong>e)  Tables</strong></p>
      <p>Each  table should be typed in double space, and 11 point font, without vertical or  horizontal lines. Each table must have a brief descriptive title. They should  not be more than one page long, and should present at least four lines and two  columns of data. Tables should be numbered in Arabic numerals, in the same  order as mentioned in the text. Abbreviations and explanations must be  identified in notes under each table, and not in its title, and identified by  letters in sequence: (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) ….The tables shall be self  explanatory, and should not duplicate data presented in the text or in  illustrations. The accuracy of all arithmetic calculations (percentages,  totals, differences) must be verified, and table data must match data mentioned  in the text.</p>
      <p><strong>f) Illustrations and Legends</strong></p>
      <p>Each  illustration shall be separately entered into the system. All illustrations  must have a legend, and it is essential that such legend describes all  characteristics of the illustration. Illustrations should be limited to the  needs of showing essential characteristics described in the manuscript.  Preferably, each illustration should depict only the area(s) of interest, with  enough surrounding visual context to allow proper orientation. It is mandatory  to indicate all characteristics described in the legends, using different  pointers for each one of them (equilateral triangles shall be avoided as  arrows). The pointers are to be directly applied on the figure, touching the  lesions (or structures) that one wishes to evidence. In the case of more than  one illustration belonging to the same case, they should be grouped over a  single legend, and each one should be identified with letters (A, B, C, etc.).</p>
      <p>Color  illustrations will only be so published in case the Editors conclude that the  colors are necessary to properly convey the information on the illustration.  Photographic images must be submitted as jpg, gif or tif files, with a 300 dpi  resolution for an approximate size of 9 x 12 cm.</p>
      <p><strong>g)  Units and Abbreviations</strong></p>
      <p>Radiation  measurements and laboratory values are to be based on units of the  International System of Units in Radiation Protection and Measurements, NCRP  Report. 28, August 1985.</p>
      <p>Abbreviations  or acronyms must be avoided. They should never be utilized in the manuscript  title, and also, preferably, never in the abstract. When utilized in the text,  they should be totally described when first mentioned, followed by the  abbreviation or acronym in parenthesis.</p>
      <p><strong>h) General Information</strong></p>
      <p>The  Journal will not accept editorial materials with commercial purposes.</p>
      <p><strong>Conflict of interests:</strong> All situations that might inappropriately  influence the development, or the conclusions of the study, shall be clearly  mentioned. Among these situations, the ownership, either wholly or in part, of  companies or their competitors involved in the production of drugs or equipment  utilized or mentioned in the study. Support received, relations of  subordination in work, consulting services etc., are also considered as sources  of conflict of interest.</p>
      <p><strong>Committee for Ethics in Research:</strong> Studies reporting results with humans shall be  supported by the appropriate authorization from the Committee for Ethics in  Research of the institution where the study was developed.</p>
      <p><strong>Clinical trials registration:</strong> Since August of 2007, all the periodicals  indexed in the Lilacs and SciELO databases require the randomized controlled  trials and clinical trials submitted for publication to be registered in a  Clinical Trials database. Such decision is based on the orientation from the  International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (ICTRP) of the World Health  Organization (WHO), and from the International Committee of Medical Journal  Editors (ICMJE). Instructions for registration are available at the ICMJE  website (<a href="http://www.icmje.org/clin_trialup.htm">http://www.icmje.org/clin_trialup.htm</a>)  and the registration can be made on the Clinical Trial database of the National  Library of Medicine available at <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct/gui">http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct/gui</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Acknowledgements:</strong> The support from people or institutions as well  as financial or technical support deserving recognition should be mentioned,  but by no means justify the inclusion of such people, institutions and  supporters amongst the authors.</p></td>
