      <p><strong>Characteristics  of the article</strong></p>
      <p>The Brazilian Journal of Tourism Research (RBTUR) publishes articles  that meet the following requirements:</p>
      <p>I. The subject is directly related to tourism.</p>
      <p>II. The subject is relevant for the theoretical/conceptual knowledge of  tourism.</p>
      <p>III. The subject or the approach is innovative as compared to the  existing literature.</p>
      <p>IV. The research method is rigorous.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Additionally, in order to be published in RBTUR, articles must:</p>
      <p>I. To be unpublished (except for academic works &ndash; e.g. dissertation or  thesis - or research reports).</p>
      <p>II. Not to be under consideration for publication anywhere else.</p>
      <p>III. To be written in Portuguese, English or Spanish.</p>
      <p>IV. To have a maximum of 10 thousand words (including abstracts,  references and all other textual elements).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Authorship</strong></p>
      <p>The list of authors should include only the names of those who  contributed significantly to the design, planning, execution, analysis or  interpretation of the research.</p>
      <p>In case of approval for publication, descriptions of the contributions  of each author will be requested. Generic descriptions or those revealing  minimal contribution of one or more authors may lead to article rejection. An  article typically have up to 3 authors. Articles with 4 or more authors should  present especially enlightening descriptions.</p>
      <p>RBTUR does not publish more than one article of the same author per  year.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Peer  Review Process</strong></p>
      <p>The articles readly undergo a desk evaluation, in which the compliance  with the norms defined in the &quot;guidelines for authors&quot;, the  association of the article with tourism, and the scientific nature of the text  are evaluated.</p>
      <p>Articles approved by the desk are submitted to peer review. At this  stage, the articles are examined by at least two researchers with experience in  the subject and / or the research method.</p>
      <p>The evaluation is blind. Referees do not have information about the  authorship of the article and the authors do not have information about the  identity of the referees. The complete list of referees of RBTUR is published  in the last number of each year.</p>
      <p>The referees are directed to examine at least the following aspects of  the articles:</p>
      <p>I. Relevance of the theme<br>
        II. Scientific rigor of the research method<br>
        III. Innovative character of the theme / approach<br>
        IV. Scope and depth of literature review<br>
        V. Property of the analysis and conclusion</p>
Finally, referees recommend the work for  publication, revision or rejection. When it undergoes substantial changes, the  article may be submitted to a new round of assessments. Articles are published  only after receiving favorable opinions from all evaluators.</td>

<p class="subtitulo"><a name="002"></a>Form and  preparation of  manuscripts</p>

<table border="0" width="100%">

  <tr> 

    <td width="15%"></td>

    <td width="70%"><p><strong>Article  preparation</strong></p>
      <p>The main article file should be submitted in Word (.doc /.docx) or  Writer (.odt) format with a maximum size of 5 Mb.</p>
      <p>All possible measures must be taken to ensure that the author(s) will  not be identified during the evaluation process:</p>
      <p>I. Do not include authors&rsquo; names in the manuscript.</p>
      <p>II. Do not use language that reveals authorship through citations (e.g.,  &quot;Another similar study has already been published by the same author  (SILVA, 1999)&quot;).</p>
      <p>III. Do not mention funding, aids, collaborations or acknowledgements.  In case of acceptance for publication, these elements will be inserted in the  final version.</p>
      <p>IV. Do not leave a record of the authors' identity in files&rsquo; properties.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The articles must contain the following elements:</p>
      <p>I. Title: Portuguese, English, and Spanish. Objective titles are  preferred.</p>
      <p>II. Summary: in Portuguese, English, and Spanish. It must contain a  maximum of 200 words and must include at least the following items:</p>
      <p>i.  Research objectives<br>
        ii.  Research methods / techniques<br>
        iii.  Main results</p>
      <p>III. Keywords: list of 3 to 5 terms in Portuguese, English and Spanish.  Terms from the Brazilian Thesaurus of Tourism are preferred (<a href="http://www2.eca.usp.br/tesauroturismo/">http://www2.eca.usp.br/tesauroturismo/</a>).</p>
      <p>IV. References: complete and exclusive list of publications cited  throughout the text.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>For articles about research with data collection, the questionnaire and  other data collection instruments should be made available to referees along  with the main file. In the electronic publishing system, the files of these  instruments should be submitted as a &quot;supplementary document&quot;.  Datasets can be requested by the referees for verification.</p>
      <p>RBTUR encourages authors to publish data collection instruments and  datasets in an open and permanent repository. This practice aims at providing  greater transparency to the research and expanding the possibilities of further  research in the same field through the use of the same dataset. In addition to  broadening the debate on the subject, the availability of these elements may  also contribute to the number of citations of the original article since it  shall be mentioned as the source of the dataset used in subsequent research.  The dataset must be published at Mendeley Data (<a href="https://data.mendeley.com/">https://data.mendeley.com/</a>).  This can be done after acceptance of the article for publication. The citation  and reference of the data will be included in the main article file.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Formatting</strong></p>
      <p>RBTUR adopts a minimum formatting requirements policy for articles  submission. There is no formatting standard for fonts, paragraphs, and pages.  Only a few formatting rules must be followed:</p>
      <p>I. Long quotes, with more than 3 lines, should appear in separate  paragraphs with a 4 cm indent from the left margin.</p>
      <p>II. The titles of the chapters must be numbered sequentially.</p>
      <p>III. Tables and figures must be numbered, titled and mentioned in the  text.</p>
      <p>IV. Tables and formulas must be in an editable format.</p>
      <p>V. Graphs and diagrams should preferably be drawn on a white background  and use Calibri font, normal, size 10, black.</p>
      <p>VI. All images must be have sufficient resolution for perfect display at  100% zoom.</p>
      <p>VII. All texts in images must be readable at 100% zoom.</p>
      <p>VIII. Footnotes should only be used when essential.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>If the author wishes to follow a specific formatting standard, the  American Psychological Association (APA) standard is suggested. It should be  noted that this standard is a mere suggestion for formatting the text, whereas  for citations and references it is mandatory, as presented in the following.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Citations  and references</strong></p>
      <p>Citations throughout the text and the list of references at the end of  the article should follow the American Psychological Association (APA) 6th  edition standards.</p>
      <p>For assistance in the task of formatting citations and references, it is  recommended to use a reference management software (e.g. Mendeley and Endnote).  In addition, there are several APA standardization manuals available on the  internet. Two recommended manuals are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Online Writing Lab (Purdue  University): <a href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/">http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/</a></li>
        <li>Thesis and dissertation  guidelines (USP): <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.11606/9788573140576">http://dx.doi.org/10.11606/9788573140576</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Citations in the text should follow the author / year system. Direct  quotes should also indicate the page number. Examples:</p>
      <p>Beni  (1998) or (Beni, 1998)<br>
        Fyall  and Leask (2007) or (Fyall &amp; Leask, 2007)<br>
        Ritchie  and Crouch (2000, p.6) or (Ritchie &amp; Crouch, 2000, p.6)<br>
        Ballantyne,  Packer and Falk (2011) or (Ballantyne, Packer, &amp; Falk, 2011)<br>
        G&ouml;ssling,  Hall, Ekstr&ouml;m, Engeset and Aall (2012) or (G&ouml;ssling, Hall, Ekstr&ouml;m, Engeset,  &amp; Aall, 2012)</p>
      <p>In their first appearance, citations of works with more than three  authors must present all last names. In subsequent citations, they should  present only the last name of the first author, followed by et al. Example:</p>
      <p>(Ballantyne  et al., 2011)<br>
        (G&ouml;ssling  et al., 2012)</p>
      <p>The list of references should be presented at the end of the text in  alphabetical order of author, according to the APA standard. Examples:</p>
      <p>Ballantyne,  R., Packer, J., &amp; Falk, J. (2011). Visitors' learning for environmental  sustainability: Testing short- and long-term impacts of wildlife tourism experiences  using structural equation modeling. Tourism Management, 32 (6), 1243-1252.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Before  starting the submission process</strong></p>
      <p>All authors must be registered in the electronic publishing system as  authors of RBTUR. At least the name, institution and email fields must be  filled in.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Submission</strong></p>
      <p>Make sure that all authors have been properly included in the publishing  system. The inclusion of authors after the submission will not be accepted. The  order of the authors in the publishing system must be the same that will appear  in the article published in case of approval.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>After  Submission</strong></p>
      <p>The editorial process can be followed through the electronic publishing  system of RBTUR.</p>
      <p>The submission of a new version of the article with the adjustments  requested by the referees must be done in the same existing registry, and not  by starting a new submission in the system. The submission should be done in  the &lsquo;Review&rsquo; tab, &lsquo;Editor Decision&rsquo; section, &lsquo;Upload Author Version&rsquo; field.</p>
      <p>In case of approval for publication, the authors will be asked to send:</p>
      <p>I. Final version of the article in the original language, including:</p>
      <p>i. For  each author: full name, brief biography, ORCID and the description his/her  contributions to the research. Author's registration in ORCID can be obtained  free of charge at <a href="https://orcid.org/">https://orcid.org/</a>.</p>
      <p>ii.  Acknowledgments.</p>
      <p>iii.  Tables and formulas in an editable format.</p>
II. Article translated into English if the  original language of the manuscript is Portuguese or Spanish. This version  should include the same elements about the authors mentioned in the previous  item. The translation should be done by a person with a good knowledge of the English  language. The English version of all the articles will be reviewed by a  professional contracted by RBTUR. If the reviewer indicates a poor quality of  the English writing, the article may be rejected, even if it was previously  accepted for publication.</td>
