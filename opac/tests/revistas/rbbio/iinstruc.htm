      <p><b>Revista Brasileira de Biologia</b> publishes the results of original 
        research in any field of Biological Sciences. It encourages publication 
        of works in Cell Biology, Systematics, Ecology (Self-ecology and Synecology) 
        and Evolutive Biology addressing neotropical region problems. 
      <p>The <b>Revista </b>publishes only articles in English. Review articles 
        on general topics will be published if submitted to and approved by the 
        <a href="iedboard.htm">Editorial Board</a>.</p>
      <p><b>General Information: </b>The originals should be submitted to the 
        <a href="iedboard.htm">Editorial Board</a> and comply with the Instructions 
        to Authors, and the papers that do not meet the requirements will be immediately 
        returned to the authors for alteration.</p>
      <p>The works that comply with the Instructions to Authors will be sent to 
        scientific advisors, indicated by the <a href="iedboard.htm">Editorial 
        Board</a>. In each case the opinion will be anonymously sent to the authors. 
        In case of unfavorable recommendation by one advisor, another referee 
        will be asked to give his/her opinion. The articles will be published 
        in order of approval by the <a href="iedboard.htm">Editorial Board</a> 
        and not in order of receiving. Twenty-five reprints of each article will 
        be provided for free.

      <p>The work to be considered for publication should comply with the following 
        general recommendations: typed and printed on one side of A4 paper, double-spaced, 
        with a 3-cm left margin and 2-cm right margin. The lines should not be 
        justified on the right side and there should be no hyphenation in the 
        end of the line. The words to be printed in italic could be underlined.</p>
      <p>The title should give a precise idea of the content and be as short as 
        possible. An abbreviated title should be provided to be printed on headings 
        of the pages.</p>
      <p><i>Name of authors</i> – The surnames J&uacute;nior, Filho, Neto, Sobrinho, 
        etc. should always be preceded by a hyphen, for example, J. Pereira-Neto. 
        Use hyphens for compound names (for instance, C. Azevedo-Ramos, M. L. 
        L&oacute;pez-Rulf). The name of the authors should always be in the correct 
        order, with no inversions. Never use as authors or co-authors names such 
        as Pereira-Neto J. Use <i>and </i>and<i> et </i>instead of <i>&</i> 
        to connect the last co-author to the first ones.</p>
      <p>The typescripts should be written in a concise, accurate and clear manner 
        required for full understanding. The writing should be definite in order 
        to avoid modifications in the proofs, which are costly and will be paid 
        by the authors. The manuscripts (including illustrations and tables) should 
        be sent in three copies (one hardcopy and two photocopies).</p>
      <p>Only articles written in English will considered for publication. All 
        articles should have abstracts in English and Portuguese. These abstracts 
        should be inserted in the beginning of the article and begin with the 
        title translated to the corresponding language. The Abstracts should contain 
        the same information and always provide a summary of results and conclusions.</p>
      <p>By and large the different parts of the articles should have the following 
        content:</p>
      <p>1<sup>st</sup> page – Title of the article. Name of authors. Name and 
        address of the institution. Indication of the number of figures included 
        in the paper. Key words in Portuguese and English (maximum of five words). 
        Abbreviated title for page headings. Footnote: name of the corresponding 
        author and current address (if applicable).</p>
      <p>2<sup>nd</sup> and subsequent pages – Abstract (no title). Abstract: 
        in Portuguese (with title); Introduction, Material and Methods, Results, 
        Discussion, Acknowledgements.</p>
      <p>In a separate page – References, Legends of figures, Tables and Figures.</p>
      <p>The paper should not exceed 25 pages, including tables and figures.</p>
      <p>The subdivision of Introduction and Acknowledgements section should be 
        used only if really applicable. The other articles (such as Systematics) 
        should be prepared according to the criteria usually accepted in this 
        field.</p>
      <p><i>References</i> – In the text, use <i>authors–year </i>for bibliographical 
        citations, and use ampersand (&) in case of two authors. The references, 
        typed on a separate sheet, should be in alphabetical order and include 
        name and initials of authors, year, full title, name of journal (abbreviated 
        and underlined), volume and the first and last page numbers. Citations 
        of books and monographs should also include the publisher and, if applicable, 
        indicate the chapter of the book. The name of the editor(s) of the collection 
        should be indicated. </p>

      <p>For further information, see the references in this issue.</p>
      <p>The journal publishes a Content list in English to be used in international 
        reference journals.</p>
      <p>The proofs are sent to the authors for a final proofreading (restricted 
        to errors and writing)&nbsp;and should be immediately returned. The proofs 
        not returned within the period required - 5 days - should have their publication 
        postponed to a later date, depending on availability of space.</p>
      <p><i>Illustrations</i> – The authors should limit tables and figures (both 
        should be referred in consecutive Arabic numbers) to what is <b>strictly 
        necessary</b>. In the typescript text, the authors should indicate where 
        they will be inserted.</p>
      <p>The tables should have a title and, in a footnote, other explanatory 
        information. Symbols and abbreviations should be defined in the main text 
        and/or legends. </p>
      <p>When preparing illustrations and tables, bear in mind the size of the 
        journal page (22 cm x 15.0 cm) (column: 7 cm) and the idea of maintaining 
        the vertical orientation. Drawings and photographs excessively large could 
        be not very clear if reduced to the size of the journal. The boards should 
        not be over 30-cm high and 25-cm wide, including calibration bars.</p>
      <p>Whenever possible, group the illustrations. The Editorial Board is entitled 
        to use this material in a more economical manner, not interfering in its 
        presentation.</p>
      <p>All drawings should be painted in China ink and submitted in such a way 
        that its reproduction is possible with no retouch. Photographs should 
        be in glossy paper. The photographs and tables should have the name of 
        authors and title of the article written on their back, in pencil.</p>
      <p><i>Diskette</i> – The authors are highly recommended to send the final 
        version (and only the final one), <b>already accepted</b>, of their typescripts 
        in diskettes. The texts should be prepared in Word for Windows and sent 
        together with a hardcopy.</p>
      <p><b>Final</b> <b>Recommendations</b>: Before submitting the paper, prepared 
        according to the previous instructions, the authors should read it again 
        carefully and draw attention to the following items: grammar check, spell 
        check (just a syllable by syllable reading is enough), <b>correspondence 
        between the works cited in the text and listed in the references</b>, 
        tables and figures in Arabic numbers, correspondence between the number 
        of tables and figures mentioned in the text and the correct position of 
        the legends.
