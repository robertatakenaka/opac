      that they are not submitting the paper for publication in any other journal. 

      It also implies that during the development of the study, the authors respect 

      and follow the rules and legislation regarding ethics, copyright, and all

      <p>FB publishes articles, short articles, notes, reviews (prepared by invited 

        authors) and letters to the editor, as described below. With the exception 

        of the last two, all other types of papers will undergo a preliminary 

        evaluation by the Editorial Board and will be submitted to critical analysis 

        by at least two <i>ad hoc </i>consultants who will be chosen from among 

        the specialists in the subject area of the submitted work. The acceptance 

        or rejection of a paper will be decided upon by a designated Associate 

        Editor and the president of the Editorial Board after reviewing the evaluation 

        of the <i>ad hoc </i>consultants. Letters to the editor and reviews will 

        be analyzed by the president of the Editorial Board who will submit it 

        to two <i>ad hoc </i>consultants selected among the Associate Editors. 

      <p><b>Articles:</b> describe a complete, original study, in which the replication 

        of the results has clearly been established. It is recommended that the 

        authors who prepare the manuscripts observe the following format: six 

        to eight printed pages (15 to 20 typed pages, double-spaced), including 

        up to 30 bibliographic references, four figures and/or graphics and four 

        tables. Please refer to any recent issue of FB for models of format. </p>

      <p><b>Short Articles: </b>should provide conclusive results and not preliminary 

        data. This is an alternative format for describing, in a more concise 

        way, partial results of a larger work, or reporting conclusive results 

        based upon a smaller amount of data. The complete text should not be more 

        than four printed pages (12 to 15 typed pages, double-spaced) and should 

        not have more than two figures/graphs, one table, and no more than 15 

        bibliographic references. Please refer to a recent issue of FB for models 

        of format.</p>

      <p><b>Notes:</b> are aimed at quickly passing on information such as: the 

        first report of a known disease in a region; biological, chemical, and 

        cultural tests, descriptions of resistant cultivars and quarantine data. 

        All text and the illustration (one figure or table) should be contained 

        on one printed page (two typed pages, double-spaced). It should contain 

        the following sections: a title, the names of the authors, addresses, 

        acceptance date, a short abstract or summary if not written in Portuguese, 

        and the text. The bibliographic references should be incorporated into 

        the text, as concisely as possible, including only the names of the authors, 

        year, and in which journal the work was published. </p>

      <p><b>Reviews:</b> are articles written by invited authors, aimed at reporting 

        on a single subject.</p>

      <p><b>Letters to the Editor:</b> have the objective of dealing with technical 

        and scientific issues, among other things, in a more informal manner. 

        These issues should be of interest to SBF and their publication will be 

        determined by the president of the Editorial Board.</p>

      <p><b>STYLE AND FORMAT</b> </p>

      <p>The manuscripts should be submitted in three copies (the original and 

        two copies) typed, double-spaced, and printed; both the lines of text 

        and the pages should be numbered. Use of the &quot;Times New Roman&quot; 

        12-point font is recommended. The text should be written in the past tense 

        of the verb and in the passive voice. The author should follow his own 

        style of writing, keeping in mind the importance of a clear, concise text. 

        As a guide to the style and format of various kinds of text, the authors 

        should examine the most recent issues of the journal and take into account 

        the guidelines concerning each section of the manuscript whose example 

        they are following. </p>

      <p>The author should neither abbreviate nor translate the name of the institution, 

        if the publication happens to be written in Spanish or English. Finally, 

        indicate a fax number and/or an e-mail address if there is one. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract:</b> should be informative and condensed and should explain 

        the objectives, material and methods, results and conclusions of the work 

        in a maximum of 250 words all written in one paragraph. It must be self-sufficient 

        and should, therefore, be written with the utmost care. The abstract will 

        be available to general public on the homepage of the SBF. </p>

      <p><b>Keywords</b>: should not repeat words that are already in the title. 

        These may include phrases as well as individual words and should be separated 

        by commas. </p>

      <p><b>Resumo:</b> should be concise, not exceeding 250 words, be of an informative 

        nature, and should be a free version, in Portuguese, of the abstract. 

      </p>

      <p><b>Introduction:</b> should present a concise vision of the current level 

        of knowledge that has been achieved within the subject area that the paper 

        will discuss. It should neither give an extensive review nor should it 

        include details about the results and discussion. It should clearly indicate 

        the objectives of the research that was carried out. </p>

      <p><b>Materials and Methods:</b> should provide enough information so that 

        others can repeat the trials. This section can contain subdivisions, with 

        subtitles in bold print, but there should not be an excessive amount of 

        these. Methods which are already well-established or have been published 

        in journals of world-wide circulation should be described in brief, with 

        sources for additional information cited and any new methods described 

        must be presented in greater detail. </p>

      <p><b>Results</b>: should describe, in a concise manner, the logic behind 

        the research and its discoveries. It should not repeat, but only make 

        reference to, the data illustrated in the tables, graphics and figures. 

        The interpretation of the results must be given in the discussion. This 

        section can have subsections which begin with concise, descriptive titles 

        in bold print. There must be a statistical analysis of the data which 

        will prove the potential for a replication of the data, whenever relevant. 

      </p>

      <p><b>Discussion</b>: should relate the results to previous studies and 

        interpret them. It may introduce a hypothesis based upon the data from 

        this study and may repeat parts of the introduction and sum up essential 

        aspects from the results section. </p>

      <p>These two latter sections can be combined and divided into subsections 

        with concise, descriptive subtitles. </p>

      <p><b>Acknowledgements:</b> a section dedicated to acknowledgements is permitted. 

      </p>

      <p><b>Bibliographic References</b>: within the text, they should have the 

        following format: Esau & Hoeffert (1977) or (Esau & Hoeffert, 1977). When 

        there are more than two authors, use a reduced form, like the following: 

        Duarte et al. (1984) or (Duarte et al., 1984). References to studies done 

        by the same author in the same year should be noted in the text and in 

        the list of references by the letters a, b, c, etc. (for example, Smith 

        1995a or Smith 1995a; b). In the Bibliography, references should be listed 

        in alphabetical order by last name, without numbering them. Papers that 

        have two or more authors should be listed in chronological order, following 

        all the papers of the first author, second author, and so on. The reference 

        should include the title, as well as the numbers of the first and last 

        page of the text; the title of the journal where it was published should 

        be given, and written out in full. The order of items in each bibliography 

        should follow the examples: </p>

      <p>Only papers that have been accepted for publication, but that have not 

        yet been published, may be cited as &quot;in press&quot; in the references 

        and should be accompanied by the name of journal and proof of acceptance. 

        Papers which have not yet been accepted can be cited in the text as unpublished 

        results. These should be listed by using the initials and complete last 

        names of all of the authors. However, the use of this type of reference 

        is not recommended. References of the following types: &quot;submitted 

        manuscripts&quot;, &quot;manuscripts in progress&quot;, as well as quotes 

        of quotes, are not allowed to be listed among the references. Any &quot;personal 

        communication&quot; should be confirmed by written statement of the person 

        cited. </p>

      <p><b>Illustrations:</b> the size of the pages printed in the journal is 

        176 x 235 mm and the text is laid out in two columns of 85 x 235 mm each. 

        The diagramming of photographs and graphics should be based on these dimensions. 

        The illustrations should follow the same style; they should be framed 

        with clear, straight lines, and be accompanied by their respective subtitles 

        underneath and have the names of the authors identified on the back. Graphics 

        should be displayed on white paper. </p>

      <p><b>Tables:</b> should have a concise title and be self-explanatory, without 

        reference to the text. Explanatory footnotes should be short and preferably 

        marked with letters or symbols. Horizontal lines should only be used to 

        separate the title (at the top of the table) from the information in the 

        table (double lines) and then again, at the bottom of the table to close 

        it up (single line). The vertical lines to separate the columns should 

        not appear. The author should avoid the use of large or long tables having 

        columns and/or lines without data. Tables should be printed using a double-spaced 

        format, on a separate sheet of paper, and be numbered in the order that 

        they appear in the text. </p>

      <p><b>Figures:</b> should be used selectively to demonstrate important, 

        specific points and take into account the importance of clarity and conciseness. 

        The legends should be printed on separate pages and should not be repetitions 

        from the information provided in the section of Materials and Methods. 

        They must be numbered in the order that they appear in the text and multiple 

        parts of a single figure should be designated (a), (b), etc. and marked 

        this way next to the figure. Figures that duplicate information found 

        in the tables or text will not be accepted. </p>

      <p><b>Drawings</b><b>:</b> should have a high level of quality that allows 

        them to be easily reproduced and they should be presented at twice the 

        size that they will actually appear in the final, printed form. They may 

        be submitted in the following formats: (a) an original drawing of black 

        lines on white paper: (b) a direct photograph of the original drawing, 

        and (c) a drawing that has been created on a computer and printed with 

        a high level of quality that allows them to be easily reproduced. Graphics 

        and/or drawings which are excessively elaborate or those having an unnecessary 

        three-dimensional format when only referring to two variables will not 

        be accepted. When choosing the size of the symbols and the distance between 

        lines, clarity and proportions should be kept in mind. </p>

      <p><b>Photographs / Micrographs:</b> photographs should be in black and 

        white, on glossy paper, and have a clear deep contrast with the background 

        of the paper, loose, not mounted; they should be approximately the same 

        size as other photographs that appear in the journal. Any notations on 

        the photographs should be made in &quot;letterset&quot; or similar style. 

        If there are several photographs, the author should try to mount them 

        as close together as possible, forming a set. In addition, the photographs 

        should all have the same tone, and there should not be white space between 

        the photographs. When submitting micrographs, indicate the degree of magnification 

        with a reference bar on the photograph itself. Photographs that have been 

        scanned will only be accepted if accompanied by the originals. Number 

        the photographs consecutively, in the same order that they will appear 

        in the text. The cost involved in copying and printing colored photographs 

        will be paid by the author. </p>

      <p><b>Serological Reactions and Pictures of Gel Electrophoresis:</b> should 

        be submitted in the form of well-contrasted photographs. Representative 

        drawings will not be accepted. </p>

      <p><b>Graphics and Computerized Images:</b> should be created on programs 

        that are compatible with the Microsoft Windows system, preferably with 

        Corel Draw. They may be submitted in the form of a copy on diskette, but 

        the author must also provide a high-quality hard copy, which allows printing 

        the image directly in the journal. The author should take into account 

        the page dimensions of the journal and consider the proportions of the 

        figures in relation to the size of the letters, numbers, and symbols. 

        Likewise, the author should avoid extremely elaborate graphics, involving 

        an excessive number of lines, slash marks, symbols, and unnecessary three-dimensional 

        figures. </p>

      <p><b>PROCESSING THE MANUSCRIPT</b> </p>

      <p>After analysis, the manuscript is always returned to the author with 

        a copy of the <i>ad hoc</i> reviewer reports and the final decision made 

        by the <a

    href="iedboard.htm#002">Senior Editor</a> and the <a

    href="iedboard.htm#001">president of the Editorial Board</a>. If the paper 

        is accepted, with or without additional corrections, the author should 

        still produce a final version which takes into account the suggestions 

        and comments provided by the reviewers and the <a href="iedboard.htm#002">Senior 

        Editor</a>, including all the changes and editing that are necessary. 

        Two copies of this final version should be sent to the <a href="iedboard.htm">Editorial 

        Board</a> along with a diskette that contains a copy of the text and an 

        indication of the type of software used. Manuscripts which have not been 

        accepted for publication will not be returned to the author. </p>

      <p><b><i>Use of the version copied on a diskette</i>:</b> the following 

        guidelines should be taken into account when the final version is sent 

        on a diskette: </p>

      <p>(a) The diskette should only be sent to the <a href="iedboard.htm">Editorial 

        Board</a> when the authors are sending the final version. </p>

      <p>(b) The <a href="iedboard.htm">Editorial Board</a> will only accept 3.5-inch 

        diskettes that have the files copied on them using software that uses 

        a format compatible with IBM computers. </p>

      <p>(c) Each diskette can only contain a copy of one manuscript, preferably 

        using the word processing program Microsoft Word. </p>

      <p>(d) The diskette should be clearly labeled, with the number of the manuscript, 

        the name(s), of the author(s), the software that was used, and the name 

        of the file. </p>

      <p>It is entirely the author's responsibility to make sure that the version 

        recorded on the diskette is an exact copy of the hard copy which has been 

        accepted for publication. Diskettes will not be returned. </p>

      <p><b>Galley Proof:</b> a copy of the manuscript's galley proof will be 

        sent to the first author who should make any necessary corrections and 

        send it back within 48 hours. Extensive corrections of the manuscript's 

        text, whose format and content have already been approved for publication, 

        will not be accepted. Alterations, additions, deletions and editing implies 

        that a new examination of the manuscript must be made by the <a

    href="iedboard.htm">Editorial Board</a>. Errors and omissions which are present 

        in the text of the corrected galley proof that has been returned to the 

        <a href="iedboard.htm">Editorial Board</a> are entirely the responsibility 

        of the author. </p>

      <p><b>Expenses: </b>a processing fee of US$35,00 is due for each paper submitted 

        for publication and should be sent together with the manuscript. The guest 

        authors who are submitting reviews will not be charged this fee. Manuscripts 

        submitted by authors who are not members of the SBF will have to pay an 

        additional charge of US$50,00 per printed page. This fee will be sent 

        together with the galley proof of the manuscript. </p>

      <p><b>STANDARDIZATIONS</b> </p>

      <p>Unconventional abbreviations should be avoided and, if they are used, 

        they should be defined the first time that they appear in the text. Conventional 

        abbreviations will be discussed below. Quantities, units, and symbols, 

        from the decimal metric system, should follow the international norms. 

        There should always be a space between a number and a unit, for example 

        37 ºC instead of 37ºC. </p>

      <p>Scientific names should be in italics, following the common name of the 

        organism. The citation of a scientific name will be according to the rules 

        of Latin binomial nomenclature, including the genus name as well as the 

        species name the first time they appear in the abstract as well as in 

        the text. The specific name should be followed by the name of the authority 

        who described it when cited for the first time in the text. The following 

        citations can have the generic name abbreviated (Ex. <i>Sclerotium rolfsii 

        </i>Saac. and <i>S. rolfsii</i>). </p>

      <p>The names of virus species should be written out completely in italics 

        with the first letter from the first name capitalized in the title of 

        the paper as well as the first time they appear in the abstract and in 

        the text following the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 

        (ICTV) recommendations. When written for the first time in the abstract 

        and in the text, the virus species name should be followed by its abbreviation 

        recommended by the ICTV in parenthesis. Examples: <i>Bean common mosaic 

        virus </i>(BCMV). After that, only the abbreviation of their name should 

        be used. The names of the taxon, family and genus, should be written in 

        italics and preceded by the name of the taxonomy unit. For example, family 

        <i>Bunyaviridae,</i> genus <i>Tospovirus.</i> </p>

      <p>When cited for the first time in the text, each virus should be identified 

        using family, genus and species terms. Example: <i>Bean common mosaic 

        virus</i> (BCMV), family <i>Potyviridae</i>, genus <i>Potyvirus.</i> </p>

      <p>The names of cultivars should be between apostrophes (inverted commas) 

        or preceded by the word cultivar or cv (ex. `Carioca', the cultivar Carioca 

        or cv Carioca). </p>

      <p><i>Molecular Mass, Mr. And K</i> </p>

      <p>The molecular mass can be expressed in two ways: (a) Mr (relative molecular 

        mass), which is a pure number without units or (b) molecular mass, that 

        is to say, the absolute molecular mass of a molecule, expressed in Daltons 

        (Da) </p>

      <p><i>Chemicals</i> </p>

      <p>Use only technical names and/or their main, active ingredients. It is 

        not acceptable to mention the commercial names of products or companies 

        that produce them and that recommend the exclusive use of the products. 

        Chemical formulas should be written out on one line and obey the nomenclature 

        that is most widely accepted at the present time. </p>

      <p><b>OTHERS</b> </p>

      <p>Guidance concerning any unforeseen situations in this list of guidelines 

        will be given by the <a href="iedboard.htm">Editorial Board</a> over the 

        course of the examination of each manuscript. </p>
