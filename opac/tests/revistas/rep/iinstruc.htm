      <p> Papers with Keynesian, developmental, or institutionalist approaches are  welcome.<br>
        The Journal publishes theoretical papers  on development economics and macroeconomics, adopting a historical-deductive  method, as well as papers criticizing economic theory.    
      <p> The Journal also welcomes applied papers containing relevant research, having  priority papers on developing countries.      
      <p> In the revisions of the literature the Brazilian and Latin-American relevant  authors are not supposed to be left aside.      
      <p> In the case of econometric studies, the technical aspects are supposed to be  published only in the journal’s electronic edition.      
      <p> The papers are published according to the date that they are approved, but some  priority will be given to the ones in English,to small papers and review-articles
      <p> The journal publishes articles in Portuguese and English, but papers that do not have the Brazilian economy as the main subject shall be written in English, or shall be translated into English after it is approved.    
      <p> In accepting the submission, the Journal adopts as additional criterion the  scope of the paper and its interest in publishing it.</td>

      <p>1. The <em>Brazilian  Journal of Political Economy </em>publishes articles or papers, small papers,  review articles, notes and comments, as well as documents that are in accordance  with its Editorial Policies. The Journal does not commission papers, but only  publishes papers that are within its field of interest. If they are accepted in  this first examination, they shall be peer reviewed and, once approved, shall  be published basically according to the order of approval.</p>
      <p> 2. The papers should contain a reasonably original  economic reasoning and a proper reference to the literature on the subject.  Papers that fail to mention the Brazilian and Latin-American authors who have relevantly  discussed the subject shall not be accepted. Papers with complex mathematical  models resulting from the use of the hypothetical-deductive method are of no  interest to the <em>Journal</em>.</p>
      <p> 3. The Journal publishes original papers, in Portuguese  or, preferably, in English. The submission of a paper to the Journal should  imply that it has not been previously published and is not being considered for  another publication. However, the simultaneous publication of a paper in the  Journal and in another one, in different languages, is allowed.</p>
      <p> 4. Once a paper in Portuguese is approved for publication,  the author shall have the option of translating it into English. Both versions  shall be published. The English version shall appear in the printed Journal,  whereas the Portuguese version shall be published only in the Journal's  electronic version.</p>
      <p> 5. Papers should not exceed 52,000 characters with spaces,  including references, tables, graphs and footnotes. Their title should be  short. Papers should include an abstract with no more than 100 words, keywords,  JEL classification, and a lead-in to the article of 20 words at most. Review  articles may have up to 62,000 characters, spaces included. Tables should be in  Word format, small (just the essential figures) and limited in number. The  number of graphs should also be limited. All equations must be compiled using the equations  tool of the word program. <strong>The  Journal's Office shall not accept articles that do not comply with those  requirements.</strong></p>
      <p> 6. Econometric papers relating certain results to certain  causes shall be accepted, but, unless they also include the development of an  original theory, they should be sent in two versions: one, to be published in  the print edition, with 30,000 characters at most; only the issue or issues  proposed and the econometric conclusions should be included in this version.  The second version, to be published in the digital edition, should be complete,  with accurate documentation on the details of the method employed, the  econometric tables, and the data used in the analyses; it should also inform  the software version and the routines used. Details of the calculations should  be sufficient to enable replication by other researchers.</p>
      <p> 7. <em>Review articles </em>consist  of a reasonably complete and updated bibliographic review of a certain subject. <em>Small papers </em>should not exceed 10  pages, should be brief, and include a theoretical model. Both are particularly  welcome and shall have priority in the publication. <em>Comments </em>are critical analyses of articles published in the  Journal; if they are accepted, the author of the commented paper shall be  entitled to a reply in the same issue; both the comment and the reply shall not  exceed 15,000 characters.</p>
      <p> 8. Quoted papers may be identified in the text or in a  footnote. When the quoted text is not the text of the original edition, the  date of the original text should appear in the text of the paper; this date  should be repeated in the reference, in parentheses, followed by the date of  the edition used, in brackets. When phrases are quoted, the page should always  be indicated; quotations and references of journal articles should always  indicate the volume, the issue, and the number of the initial and final pages  of the article. At the end of the article, the reference should be limited to  the quoted papers and should obey the following format:</p>
      <p> Marx, Karl (1867 [1968]) <em>O Capital –  Livro I. </em>Rio de Janeiro: Civilização Brasileira.</p>
      <p> Rangel, Ignácio M. (1981) “A história da dualidade brasileira”, <em>Revista de Economia Política</em>, 1(4):  5-34.</p>
      <p> 9. Articles shall only  be submitted to the referees of the Editorial Board as long as they comply with  the requirements above and deal with a subject specified in the Editorial  Policies.</p>
      10. The Journal does not charge for submissions.  The submission of a paper implies its authorization for publication in the  Journal. No copyrights shall be paid.</td>
