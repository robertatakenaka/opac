      <p>The originals will be accepted for evaluation as long as they have not 

        been published before, and to them should be attached a letter from the 

        Managing Editor asking for its publication. In this letter, the author(s) 

        should inform any eventual conflict of interest - professional, financial 

        and direct or indirect benefits - that might influence in the result of 

        the research. They should also reveal the financial source involved in 

        the work, as well as ensure the privacy and the anonymity of the party 

        involved in it. 

      <p>The material submitted must also contain a declaration of the author(s) 

        according to the following model: I, ___________________, hereby declare 

        that the so titled article _______________, presented for publication 

        in the &Aacute;gora - Estudos em Teoria Psicanal&iacute;ticas Magazine, 

        hasn't been previously published or shown for evaluation or publication 

        in any other magazine or book, thus, it is an original work.</p>
      <p>These documents must be attached in <strong>&quot;Supplementary  Documents&quot;,</strong> in the SciELO platform. </p>
<p>Firstly, the work will be judged by the Editor, who will send a letter 

        or an e-mail to the author communicating the beginning of the editorial 

        process, as long as the forwarded material is in agreement with the norms 

        established by the Journal.</p>

      <p>Then, the manuscript will be sent for evaluation to two anonymous parties 

        who can either reject, recommend the publication with reconsiderations 

        and corrections to be done to it or accept the publication without modifications. 

        In the case of a publication disagreement between the parties, the work 

        will be sent to a third party. All reviews will be sent to the author 

        either simply to justify the final result or so that any necessary changes 

        can be made, this being the case the author should make the necessary 

        changes and forward the reformulated work back in a maximum of twenty 

        days. The work will be resent to the evaluating party once again, and 

        they will give once more their new evaluation.</p>

      <p>It depends on the Editorial Council the final decision about the publication. 

        Small changes could me made to the text by the Editorial Council in order 

        to attend to the operational rules or criteria of the Journal.</p>

      <p>Works will be accepted for publications in the &Aacute;gora - Estudos 

        em teoria psicanaliticas Journal only have authors who have a Master or 

        Doctor degree. There might be an exception to this rule in a case of authors 

        who have notorious knowledge, and being the Editorial Council responsible 

        for forwarding these authors' articles to the evaluating parties.</p>
      <p>Given the growth in the number of co-authors per article in many  manuscripts referred to <em>Ágora - Estudos em Teoria Psicanalítica</em>,<strong> the  maximum number of authors is limited to three.</strong></p>
      <p><em>Ágora </em>welcomes for evaluation articles  written in Portuguese, English, Spanish and French. When approved, <strong>articles</strong> <strong>written by authors of foreign affiliation</strong> must be translated into  English and the costs involved will be borne by the authors themselves. Authors  of Brazilian affiliation who wish to publish in the English language, should  also preserve the Portuguese version (bilingual publication) and bear the costs  of the translation. </p>
      <p><strong>The quality of the writing </strong>of  the article became a decisive criterion of approval, which includes: grammar  and spelling; clarity in the expression of ideas; citations submitted according  to the norms of the journal; presentation, organization and article size. The  author is responsible for the adequacy of his work to the &quot;Publication  Rules&quot; that can be accessed through the link:  http://www.scielo.br/revistas/agora/pinstruc.htm.

Please be advised  that if the reviewers request revision of the essay, the author will have to  carry it out and will be responsible for the costs of the essay. In this case,  we will indicate a qualified reviewer to carry out the work. </p>

      <p>It asked from the parties that these take in consideration the inclusion 

        of the evaluated article in the comprehended Journal field, as well as 

        the organization, the contents and the writing of the work, which should

      <p>Since it is a specialized Journal in the psychoanalyses field, its target 

        public is the professionals and researches in this field of knowledge. 

        In this way, it is wise to consider the fundamental importance of a specialized 

        Journal in this academic field. <b>&Aacute;gora - estudos em teoria psicanal&iacute;tica</b> 

        had a pioneer role in circumscribing the limits of the psychoanalytic 

        knowledge in the academic field and clearly point out the need for a deeper 

        study in psychoanalytic theory. In this context, the project of a magazine, 

        which has characterized itself as an essential mean for the promotion 

        of productions, has been done in many Programs. The same is true in relation 

        to the productions of foreigner authors once the Graduation Programs keep 

        a formal and informal partnership with many Programs abroad - e.g. Spain, 

        Argentine and France. Such agreements are straightened also through researches 

        done by many of these Programs' PhDs students.
