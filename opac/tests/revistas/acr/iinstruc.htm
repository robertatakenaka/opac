    <td width="70%"><p>ACR accepts original  unpublished studies in either Portuguese or English, which contribute to  knowledge and present applicability to Speech, Language and Hearing sciences.  When submitting a manuscript, the authors ensure that the study was not  previously published nor is currently under consideration for publication  elsewhere. If a previous publication or simultaneous submission to another  journal is identified the article will be disregarded. All submitted  manuscripts are evaluated by the Editorial Board, and after approval are  forwarded to a reviewer committee (peer review). However, the final decision on  the manuscript is made by the editors. The manuscript acceptance will be based  on originality, relevance, and scientific contribution to the improvement of  the field.&nbsp; The confidentiality is  guaranteed throughout the evaluation process. Authors are solely responsible  for the manuscript content, the accuracy of information and citations, as well  as its translation into English, done or reviewed by a native speaker.</p>
      ACR publishes the following  types of manuscripts: Original articles, Original case reports, Systematic  review or meta-analysis articles, Short communications and Letters to the  editors. Simple case reports, simple literature reviews, summaries and  technical reports will not be accepted. The text should conform to the  structure required for each type of manuscript.</td>

Thus, only clinical research articles  which have received identification number from one of the Clinical Trial  Registers validated by criteria established by WHO and ICMJE will be accepted  for publication in ACR. Information are available at <a href="http://www.icmje.org" target="_blank">http://www.icmje.org</a>, at <a href="http://www.who.int/ictrp/network/primary/en/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.who.int/ictrp/network/primary/en/index.html</a> or <a href="http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/" target="_blank">http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/</a>.
