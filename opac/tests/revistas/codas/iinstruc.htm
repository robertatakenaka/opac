 <p>CoDAS  (online ISSN 2317-1782) is a scientific and technical open access journal published  bimonthly by the Brazilian Speech-Language pathology and Audiology Society  (SBFa). It is a continuation of  the former “Pró-Fono Revista de Atualização Científica” – ISSN 0104-5687, until  2010 and “Jornal da Sociedade Brasileira de Fonoaudiologia (JSBFa)” – ISSN  2179-6491, until 2012.</p>
 <p>The journal's mission is to contribute to the dissemination of scientific and technical knowledge in the field of Communication Sciences and Disorders - specifically in the areas of Language, Audiology, Voice, Orofacial Motricity, Dysphagia, and Public Health. The journal's name CoDAS was created based on the "Communication Disorders, Audiology and Swallowing" main areas and was conceived to be short and easy to remember. The abbreviated title of the journal is CoDAS, which might be used in bibliography, notes, references and citations. The journal is a publication of the Brazilian Society of Speech-Language pathology.</p>
 <p>CoDAS accepts original submissions in Portuguese, Spanish and English. Accepted articles originally submitted in Portuguese or Spanish will be translated and published both in their original language and English. Translation will run at the authors' expense and should be conducted by companies appointed by CoDAS or companies with proven experience in the translation of scientific articles in the area. Native or native-like speakers of English may submit their manuscript directly in English; in which case, the publication will not be translated into Portuguese but the English version will be evaluated and, if necessary, English language revision will be required at the authors' expense. Complete journal's policies may be found in the Instructions for Authors.</p>

 <p>The following types of manuscripts are accepted for publication: &quot;Original articles&quot;, &quot;Systematic reviews with or without meta-analysis&quot;, &quot;Brief communications&quot;, &quot;Case reports&quot;, and &quot;Letters to the editor&quot;.</p>
 <p><strong>Original article: </strong><br>
  Original and unpublished articles intended for dissemination of scientific research outcomes. Article structure must comprise the following sections: abstract, keywords, introduction, methods, results, discussion, conclusion, and references.</p>
 <p>The <strong>abstract</strong> should provide information that encourages the reading of the article and, therefore, it should not contain abbreviations, numerical or statistical results. The <strong>introduction</strong> should present a brief review of the literature that justifies the study objectives. The <strong>methods</strong> should be described with sufficient detail and include only relevant information to allow reproduction of the study. The <strong>results</strong> should be interpreted, indicating the statistical significance for the data found, and should not, therefore, be a mere presentation of tables, charts, and figures. The data presented in the text should not be duplicated in tables, charts, and figures and/or vice versa. It is recommended that data be submitted to inferential statistical analysis whenever appropriate. The <strong>discussion</strong> should not repeat the results or the introduction, and the <strong>conclusion</strong> must respond concisely to the proposed objectives, indicating clearly and objectively the relevance of the submitted study and its contribution to the advancement of science. Of the cited <strong>references </strong>(30 at the most), at least 90% should consist of articles published in indexed journals of the national and international literature, preferably <strong>in the past five years</strong>. Citations of theses/dissertations or papers presented at scientific meetings shall not be included. The document must not exceed 30 pages.</p>
 <p>The approval number of the Research Ethics Committee, as well as a statement informing that all individuals (or their caregivers) involved in the study signed the Informed Consent Form, in the case of research involving humans or animals (as well as medical records or documents of an institution), are mandatory and must be included in the methods section. The approval document of the Research Ethics Committee and the Informed Consent Form should be scanned and attached to the system at the time of manuscript submission.</p>
 <p><strong>Systematic review with or without meta-analysis:</strong><br>
  Articles intended to respond to a research question and critically analyze all scientific evidence on the research theme. They result from a methodological survey that aims to identify, collect, and analyze, with appropriate search strategy for this type of research, studies that tested the same hypothesis, gather the same data, present these data in graphs, tables and/or tables, and interpret the evidence. The systematic reviews should describe in detail the data collection method, justify the choice of the databases consulted, and indicate the relevance of the theme and its contribution to science. The numerical results of the studies included in the review may, in many instances, be statistically analyzed by means of meta-analysis. Articles with meta-analysis should comply strictly with the set of rules indicated for this technique. Systematic and meta-analysis reviews shall present the following structure: abstract, keywords, introduction, purposes, search strategy, selection criteria, data analysis, results, conclusion, and references. All works selected for a systematic review should be listed in the references. The file must not exceed 30 pages. For further information visit the Guest Editorial at: <a href="http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S2317-17822015000500409&lng=pt&nrm=iso&tlng=pt" target="_blank">http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S2317-17822015000500409&amp;lng=pt&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=pt</a></p>
 <p><strong>Case report: </strong><br>
  Articles presenting unprecedented, unusual, or innovative cases or experiences - single or series of cases - with unique features of interest to professional practice, describing their aspects, history, management, and outcomes. Their structure shall comprise abstract, keywords, introduction (with brief literature review), case presentation, discussion, final comments, and references (maximum of 15). The document must not exceed 20 pages. The presentation of the clinical case must contain a statement informing that the individuals (or their caregivers) involved have signed the Informed Consent Form, thus agreeing with the completion and dissemination of the study and its results. In case patient images are used, a copy of the Informed Consent Form stating their approval for reproduction of images in scientific journals must be attached at the time of article submission. </p>
 <p><strong>Brief  communication: </strong><br>
   Short  research articles aiming to present interesting preliminary results of impact  to the area of communication disorders, audiology, and swallowing. Files are limited  to 2,500 words (from introduction to conclusion). They follow the same format  of the original articles, comprising abstract, key words, introduction, method,  results, discussion, conclusion, and references. They should contain two tables/charts/figures at the most and a maximum of 15 references, of which at  least 80% should consist of articles published in indexed journals of the  national and international literature, preferably within the past five years.</p>
 <p><strong>Letter  to the editor:<br>
 </strong>Constructive, objective, educative criticism of  published material or discussion of current specific topics. The letters will  be published based on Editorial decision and should be short (up to 1,200  words). </p>
 <p><strong>CoDAS</strong> supports the policies for registration of clinical trials of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors(ICMJE), recognizing the importance of these initiatives for the registration and international dissemination of information on clinical trials in open access. Therefore, only clinical research articles that have received an identification number in one of the Clinical Trial Registries validated by the criteria established by WHO and ICMJE will be accepted for publication. Clinical Trial Registries addresses are available at the ICMJE website <a href="http://www.icmje.org/" target="_blank">www.icmje.org</a> or at <a href="http://www.who.int/ictrp/network/primary/en/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.who.int/ictrp/network/primary/en/index.html</a>. The identification number must be provided at the end of the abstract.</p>
 <p><strong>CoDAS</strong> is in line with the good policy for scientific practices and, therefore, attentive to cases of suspected scientific misconduct, whether regarding the preparation of projects, research performance, or dissemination of science. Plagiarism and self-plagiarism are forms of scientific misconduct involving the appropriation of intellectual ideas or contributions of others without due recognition in the form of citation. To this end, we adopted the iThenticate system with the intention of identifying text similarities that may be considered plagiarism. It is worth noting that authors are fully responsible for the content of their manuscripts.</p>
 <p><strong>Design and preparation of manuscripts </strong></p>
The following rules must be followed for all types of manuscripts. They were based on the format proposed by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors<em> (</em>ICMJE),published in the article &ldquo;Uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to Biomedical journals&rdquo; in its version of April, 2010, available at <a href="http://www.icmje.org/" target="_blank">http://www.icmje.org/</a>.</td>

 <tr> 
 <td width="15%"></td>
 <td width="70%"><p>Manuscripts should be submitted exclusively through the Online Publishing System available at <a href="http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/codas-scielo" target="_blank">http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/codas-scielo</a>.</p>
  <p>Evaluation of manuscripts submitted to <strong>CoDAS</strong> follows a three-phase process:</p>
  <p><strong>1. Technical assessment:</strong><br>
All submitted manuscripts are verified with respect to the requirements described in the submission rules. Those not in compliance with the rules or not presenting all requested documents are returned to the authors for adjustments. Articles in accordance with the rules and accompanied by all necessary documents are forwarded to the next phase. </p>
  <p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Evaluation of scope and interest:</strong><br>
   The manuscripts approved in the technical evaluation are sent to the Editors-in-chief along with the similarity report (via iThenticate). The editors analyze the similarity report and conduct a preliminary scientific assessment regarding study field, scope, relevance, and interest for publication. Manuscripts with many problems, out of scope, or with no relevance or interest to the Journal's mission may be &ldquo;<strong>Rejected immediately</strong>&rdquo; by editorial decision. Articles with potential for publication are forwarded to peer review. </p>
  <p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Peer rating:</strong><br>
   Articles are assessed by at least two referees of the area of knowledge of the study, from national and international education and/or research institutions with proven scientific production. Referees&rsquo; opinions on the manuscripts are as follows: &ldquo;Accepted&rdquo;, &ldquo;Accepted with minor adjustments&rdquo;, &ldquo;Accepted with major adjustments&rdquo;, &ldquo;Rejected&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Rejected with possibility for resubmission&rdquo;. &ldquo;Rejected&rdquo; or &ldquo;Accepted with minor/major adjustments&rdquo; opinions are always accompanied by the referees&rsquo; assessment comments; blind review is guaranteed throughout the trial process. After corrections and possible suggestions, the article will be accepted if it received two favorable opinions and rejected if it received two unfavorable opinions. In the event of conflicting reviews, one of the Associate Editors of the area may be consulted. If doubt or dispute regarding editorial decision still remains, the authors may contact the Editors-in-chief, who will receive the justifications and clarify the process doubts. ​ ​ </p>
  <p>Manuscripts under review should not be submitted for publication to any other national or international journal until they are accepted for publication or rejected by the editorial board. Only the Editor-in-chief can authorize the reproduction of articles published in <strong>CoDAS</strong> in other media. </p>
In case of doubt, authors should contact the executive secretary via e-mail: <a href="mailto:codas@editoracubo.com.br" target="_blank">codas@editoracubo.com.br</a>.</td>
