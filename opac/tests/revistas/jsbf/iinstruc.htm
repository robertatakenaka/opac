      <p>The journal accepts original researches in Portuguese, English or Spanish. 
        After the approval of the Scientific Editorial Board, the manuscripts 
        will be analyzed and evaluated by two reviewers, who will be kept anonymous 
        throughout the whole analysis process. The reviewers' comments will be 
        sent to the authors for proper modifications or justifications. Only after 
        final approval by the editors and reviewers the manuscripts will be published. All  manuscripts from Brazilian authors will be bilingual Portuguese/English. Hence,  after technical review, the authors of accepted articles will receive  instructions regarding the translation of the manuscript into English. The  English version will be of the authors&rsquo; full responsibility.
        Manuscripts not in agreement with the journal's guidelines will not be 
        reviewed.
      <p>The journal has the following sections: Original articles, Case reports, 
        Evidence-based Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology, Brief communications, 
        and Letters to the Editor. </p>
      <p><b>Original articles: </b>present the results from original unpublished 
        scientific investigation. Its structure must contain: Abstract and keywords 
        (both in Portuguese/Spanish and English), Introduction, Methods, Results, 
        Discussion, Conclusion, and References. The results must be interpreted, 
        indicating statistical relevance found for the data, hence avoiding mere 
        presentation of tables, charts and figures. Data presented on the text 
        should not be duplicated on the tables, charts and figures and/or vice-versa. 
        It is recommended that data receive inferential statistical analysis, 
        in order to be more conclusive. At least 70% of the cited references (maximum 
        30) must refer to articles published in national or international journals. 
      </p>
      <p>In the manuscripts regarding research carried out with human beings or 
        animals (as well as surveys focusing institutional records or documents), 
        it is mandatory the citation of the protocol number for the approval of 
        the Ethics Committee of the institution where the research was executed 
        in the Methods section, as well the statement that all individuals involved 
        (or their legal guardians) signed the Free and Informed Consent Term. 
      </p>
      <p><b>Case reports: </b>report singular, non-routine cases or experiences 
        with up to ten subjects, interesting to professional practice, describing 
        its aspects, history, procedures, etc. Must include: Abstract and keywords 
        (both in Portuguese/Spanish and English), Introduction (with brief literature 
        review), Clinical case presentation, Discussion, Final comments, and References 
        (maximum 15).</p>
      <p>The Clinical case presentation section must contain the statement that 
        all subjects involved (or their legal guardians) signed the Free and Informed 
        Consent Term, thereby allowing the implementation and dissemination of 
        the research and its results. If images from the subjects are used, a 
        copy of the Free and Informed Consent Term, authorizing the use of the 
        images for scientific purposes, must be attached.</p>
      <p><b>Evidence-based Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology:</b> systematic 
        review manuscripts that demonstrate evidence based on studies available 
        in international literature. Result from a methodological research with 
        the aim of identifying, collecting and analyzing previous studies testing 
        the same hypothesis, systematically gather similar data in graphs, tables 
        and charts, and interpret the evidence. Numerical results from the studies 
        included in the review can, in many circumstances, be statistically analyzed 
        by means of meta-analysis. Articles submitted to this section must contain 
        the following structure: Abstract and keywords (both in Portuguese/Spanish 
        and English), Introduction, Objectives, Research strategy, Selection criteria, 
        Data analysis, Results, Conclusion, and References. All studies selected 
        for the systematic review must be listed. </p>
      <p><b>Brief communications: </b>brief research articles, with the aim to 
        present interesting results, impacting for Speech-Language Pathology and 
        Audiology. They are limited to 4500 characters, (from Introduction to  Conclusion). It must include: Abstract and keywords 
        (both in Portuguese/Spanish and English), Introduction, Methods, Results,

        will be published at editors' criteria. The letters should be brief (250-500 
        words).</p>
      <p>The Jornal da Sociedade Brasileira de Fonoaudiologia - JSBFa supports 
        World Health Organization (WHO) and International Committee of Medical 
        Journal Editors<i> </i>(ICMJE) policies, recognizing the importance of 
        these initiatives in order to register and divulge clinical trials information, 
        in open access. Therefore, only clinical research articles presenting 
        an identification number validated by WHO and ICMJE criteria available

      <p><b>Tables:<br>
        </b>Present tables separated from the text, each one on a different page, 
        at the end of the document. Tables must be typed with double space and 
        in Arial 8, and sequentially numbered, in Arabic numbers, following the 
        order in which they appear in the text. All tables must have a short, 
        self-explanatory title, inserted above it, and all columns must be identified 
        with a headline. Any abbreviations and information about statistic tests 
        used should be presented at the bottom of the table. The number of tables 
        should be enough to concisely describe data, and they must not repeat 
        information presented textually. Regarding the presentation form, tables 
        must have horizontal lines separating headline, body and conclusion, with 
        open laterals. The maximum number of tables accepted is five.</p>
      <p><b>Charts:<br>
        </b>Must follow the same guidelines described for tables, except for the 
        presentation form, that can use vertical lines and must be laterally closed. 
        The maximum number of charts is two.</p>
      <p><b>Figures (graphs, photographs, and illustrations): <br>
        </b>The figures must also be presented separately from the text, at the 
        end of the document, consecutively numbered in Arabic numbers, following 
        the order in which they appear in the text. All figures should be black 
        and white (or grey scale), with proper graphic quality (use only white background), and 
        present the title in legend, typed in Arial 8. The figures can also be 
        uploaded as supplementary documents in an electronic file separate from 
        the text (the image applied in the text processor doesn't necessarily 
        mean that the original is copied). To avoid problems that compromise the 
        pattern of the journal, the image digitalization process (scan) must have 
        the following parameters: for graphs or schemes, use <i>800 dpi/bitmap 
        </i>for trace; for illustrations and photographs (black and white) use 
        <i>300 dpi/RGB </i>or <i>grayscale</i>. In all cases, the files must have 
        extension <i>.tif</i> and/or <i>.jpg</i>. Files with extensions <i>.xls</i> 
        (Excel), .<i>cdr</i> (CorelDraw), <i>.eps</i> and <i>.wmf</i> will also 
        be accepted for illustrations in curve (graphs, drawings, schemes). There 
        should not be more than five figures. If the figures were already published 
        elsewhere, written permission from the author/editor must be sent along 
        with the article, and the source must be cited at the legend of the figure.</p>
      <p><b>Legends:</b> </p>
      <p>Present the legends using double space, following the respective tables, 
        charts, figures (graphs, photographs and illustrations), and appendixes.</p>
      <p><b>Abbreviations e Codes:</b> </p>
      <p>Should be preceded by the full name when cited for the first time in 
        the text. Legends of figures, tables, charts and appendixes must also 
        be accompanied by the full name. Abbreviations and codes should not be 
        used in the title or in the abstract.</p>
