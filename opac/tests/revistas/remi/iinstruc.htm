    <td width="70%"><p>REM has specialized in the publication of articles  concerning the Civil, Geological, Metallurgical and Materials, Mechanic and  Energy and Mining Engineerings.</p>    
      <p>Its objective is to provide publication opportunities  for national and international researchers engaged in the abovementioned  fields. Original technical-scientific contributions (articles and letters) are  accepted. Revised articles depend upon invitation and/or Editor&rsquo;s analysis.</p>
      <p> The presentation of articles for publication implies  that the paper has not been previously published; that it is not being  presented to any other magazine for publication; and that it will not be  published in the same form in any other place without written authorization  from the Editors.</p>
      <p> The Editor, Associate Editor and members of the  Editorial Board will seek competent reviews of papers prior to accepting them  for publication or recommending revisions. The Associate Editor, who assumes  complete responsibility for decisions regarding manuscripts, could eventually  disregard the recommendations of the examiners. The Editor will advise the  authors when a paper is rejected and no communication regarding these  manuscripts will be made to other magazines.</p>
      <p> Responsibility for approval of the paper by all  coauthors rests with the submitting author. During preparation of manuscripts,  authors must read and carefully follow the guidelines presented here. Questions  should be directed to the Editor at <a href="mailto:editor@rem.com.br">editor@rem.com.br</a></p>
      <p>
        Our journals require you to add Preferred and/or  Non-Preferred Reviewers and/or Editors for your manuscript, and they should not  belong to your institution. It is up to the Associate Editor to accept, or not,  your indication. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Articles accepted for publication become property of the journal.</p>
      <p>The Journal adopts CrossCheck system for identifying plagiarism.</p></td>

      <p>      Regular articles, focused on new data, may discuss any aspect of the areas that REM deals with. These articles are reviewed by at least two expert readers indicated by the Associate Editor</p>
      <p>The article&rsquo;s outline should maintain the following standard format for publication:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> &bull;	<strong>Title</strong> (Avoid long titles and unnecessary words: &ldquo;Study about&hellip;.&rdquo;, &ldquo;Contribution to &hellip;&rdquo;)<br>
          &bull;	<strong>Authors</strong> (organize by level of research participation)<br>
          &bull;	<strong>Abstract</strong>(Each paper must be preceded by an abstract presenting a concise summary of the facts contained in the article, keywords, illuminating important facts and conclusions. This abstract of about 150 to 250 words is required. No references, figures, or tables should be included in the abstract.)<br>
          <strong>&bull;	Introduction<br>
&bull;	Material e method<br>
&bull;	Results<br>
&bull;	Discussion<br>

      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>Text</strong><br>
        Articles will be accepted in English. Microsoft Word is the recommended software for the body of the paper. Articles should be precise, not longer than 08 pages in size 12 Times New Roman font, including abstracts, illustrations, tables, bibliographical references, etc. Use the indent function for paragraphs and automatic pagination.<br>
        Papers should be typed with automatic spacing (given a space between each item). The paper to be used is A4 and should have 2cm margins. The text should not be presented in columns.<br>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Line drawings.</strong><br>
        &bull;	Definition: Black and white graphic with no shading.<br>
        &bull;	Do not use faint lines and/or lettering and check that all lines and lettering within the figures are legible at final size.<br>
        &bull;	All lines should be at least 0.1 mm (0.3 pt) wide.<br>
        &bull;	Scanned line drawings and line drawings in bitmap format should have a minimum resolution of 1200 dpi.<br>
        &bull;	Vector graphics containing fonts must have the fonts embedded in the files.<br>
        &bull;	Shades of gray in drawings should be no less than 20% apart to be distinguished easily in print.</p>
      <p><strong>Tables</strong><br>
        &bull;	All tables are to be sequentially numbered, using Arabic numerals. Use Word or Excel&mdash; a format that we can edit for style.<br>
        &bull;	Tables should always be cited within the text in consecutive numerical order.<br>
        &bull;	Footnotes to tables should be indicated by superscript lower-case letters (or asterisks for significance values and other statistical data) and included beneath the table body.<br>
        &bull;	Table legends must be brief, and self-sufficient explanations of the illustrations. The legends should be placed at the top of the text.</p>
      <p><strong>Photos</strong><br>
        Photos should be scanned at no less than 300 dpi. Scanned photos with lettering should be scanned at no less than 600 dpi. This is to compensate for text (including arrows) that is bitmapped when scanned. An alternate solution is to place art in a vector program (Illustrator or CorelDraw, for example) and then add text and arrows.<br>
        The correct resolution to black and white photo: keep to a minimum of 0.5 MB<br>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Color photos/art: </strong><br>
        REM publishes up to four (4) photographs in color. Beyond this number is at the author&rsquo;s expense. <br>
        If, together with your accepted article, you submit usable color figures, then REM will ensure, at no additional charge, that these figures will appear in color online regardless of whether or not these illustrations are reproduced in color in the printed version. For color reproduction in print, you will receive information regarding the costs from REM after receipt of your accepted article. Color approved by the Editor is free for REM subscribers; otherwise it is $50/photo or page. Please indicate your preference for color: in print or online only.<br>
      Because of technical complications that can arise by converting color figures to &ldquo;gray scale&rdquo; (for the printed version, if you do not opt for color in print), please submit in addition usable black and white versions of all the color illustrations.</p>
      <p><strong>Plates. </strong><br>
        Several figures or figure parts should be grouped in a plate on one page.</p>
      <p><strong>Size of figures.</strong> <br>
        The figures should match the width of the column, either (6.3 cm) or (12.6 cm) </p>
      <p><strong>Figure legends </strong><br>
        Must be brief, self-sufficient explanations of the illustrations. The legends should be placed at the end of the text.</p>
      <p><strong>Discussion</strong><br>
        &bull;	Readers can debate all the articles published in REM.<br>
        &bull;	Letters should be concise, not more than 05 pages including abstract, illustrations, tables, bibliographic references, etc. In very special cases, a superior number of pages will be accepted, providing the data presented is extremely important to the understanding of the topic in discussion.<br>
        &bull;	Papers should be typed following the publication format of REM articles.<br>
      &bull;	After Editorial analysis, letters and their replies will be listed in the index of the volume in which they were published.</p>
      <p><strong>Scientific Communication</strong><br>
        REM can publish information on recent discoveries or developments in the above-mentioned fields. Letters should be concise, not more than 2 pages, including abstracts, illustrations, tables, bibliographic references, etc. They should be typed according to the standard publication format of REM articles.</p>
      <p><strong>Thesis Abstracts</strong><br>
        REM will publish thesis abstracts, if submitted. They should be typed in both Portuguese/Spanish and English.</p>
      <p><strong>News</strong><br>
        REM will publish engineering news, including book/magazine launchings, congresses, etc., for companies and educational institutions.</p>
      <p><strong>Bibliographic references</strong><br>
        Bibliographic references should be listed at the end of the text, in alphabetical order by first author&rsquo;s last name according to Documentation Regulation NBR-6023, examples of which are given below:</p>

      <p><strong>Copyright transfer</strong><br>
