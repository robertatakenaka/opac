   <p>The journal publishes, preferably, works derived from theoretical studies, practical experiments, researches, reflections, and polemic current debates, seeking to offer to its readers texts of quality and excellence, both by national researchers and translations of works by foreign researchers.</p>
   <p>The editorial line of the journal covers innovative themes and methodologies that are not well-known in the vehicles of the field, emphasizing&nbsp; experimentation and contemporary approaches, in addition to publishing works that are well established in regard to their form and/or argumentation. The idea of&nbsp;<em>Presence&nbsp;</em>works for the editorial line as a catalyst through which conflate perspectives of research and analyses with emphasis on the creative process, especially in theatre and dance.</p>
   <p>We publish previously unpublished texts in Portuguese or Spanish. The editors may invite Portuguese or Spanish-language authors to send English versions for bilingual publication. The journal accepts unpublished texts in English and French from foreign authors and provides Portuguese translations for bilingual publication.</p>
   <p>The journal is organized into thematic sections with the purpose of inducing subjects and approaches, creating interfaces between methodologies and different theories, thus, the journal gives preference to texts that take forward the knowledge in the Performing Arts.</p>
   <p>The&nbsp;<em>Revista Brasileira de Estudos da Presen&ccedil;a</em>&nbsp;receives proposals of individual texts as well as &nbsp;thematic sections. Both are assessed through the principle of blind peer review, or opinions from at least two specialists from states or countries different from the author's state or country.</p>
   <p>The journal accepts texts in the form of scientific articles, avoiding texts that are: merely research projects or reports; exclusively literature review; excerpts from academic work without adaptation; reports of experiences without thorough theoretical discussion; incomplete or insufficiently developed for the theme they propose; outside the field of the Performing Arts and correlated areas; written in non-academic fashion or that contain too many orthographic and typing mistakes; formatted using rules that are different from the rules practiced by the journal.</p>
   <p>The texts are reviewed in three stages. In the first stage, the text is sent to two reviewers from the editorial board or ad hoc reviewers, (experts in the area or approach of the article in question). During the second stage, the editors forward the texts that have received two favourable opinions; return to the authors the texts that have received two unfavourable opinions; forward to a third reviewer the texts whose evaluation is considered doubtful or inconsistent; and send to the authors the texts for which the evaluators made suggestions for modifications as a condition for publication; giving a deadline of 30 days for these modifications. The third stage consists in the evaluation of the changes made by the authors, when necessary, and the forwarding of approved texts for&nbsp; language review and standardization. In order to take forward the production in the area, all stages of evaluation are accompanied by descriptive opinions.</p>
   <p>Thematic section proposals can be submitted by a researcher who must send from six to eight texts, and at least one translation of a work by an author connected to a foreign institution. The section must have a clear theme and diversity of approaches, and be introduced by the organizer, in addition to collecting texts by researchers from different institutions, not exceeding one text per author or co-author. The evaluation process of thematic section proposals is similar to the evaluation process of individual articles, according to the description above. In order to prompt certain themes, the journal can also invite researchers to contribute with texts, in much smaller proportion in comparison to the reviewed texts, under the condition that they are an important contribution to the field.</p>
   <p>There are no fees for submission and review articles.</p></td>

   <p>1) The Revista Brasileira de Estudos da Presen&ccedil;a publishes only unpublished articles resulting from research, studies, debates, artistic and scientific practices in the area of the performing arts and associated fields. We publish previously unpublished texts in Portuguese or Spanish. The editors may invite Portuguese or Spanish-language authors to send English versions for bilingual publication. The journal accepts unpublished texts in English and French from foreign authors and provides Portuguese translations for bilingual publication.</p>
   <p>2) The texts should be in the form of articles, emphasizing the theoretical dimension and presenting a unique and important contribution to the area. The author(s) is(are) fully responsible for the format and content of his/her (their) article.</p>
   <p>3) It is recommended that the texts about performances, spectacles, or similar, present images and/or video which should be included in the text body, captioned below the insertion, single-spaced and centralised. The authors declare that they have permission to use the images inserted.</p>
   <p>4) Texts composing thematic sections organised by invited or voluntary researcher must be entered into the system by the author themselves, and go through the same process of peer review. See details under &ldquo;Peer review process.&rdquo;</p>
   <p>5) The texts must be sent through the SEER system (<a href="http://seer.ufrgs.br/presenca" target="_blank">www.seer.ufrgs.br/presenca</a>) where the authors' data have to be entered exclusively into the electronic form, including the email address and a biography of a maximum of three lines, emphasizing institutional links, as well as academic and artistic education. The funding source of the research, when appropriate, must be mentioned in the appropriate box. The text file must be free from any kind of identification, be it the authors' names in the text body or in the file properties, or the mention of any information through which the authorship of the text might be inferred. If you have difficulties in anonymising the article, just mention that in &ldquo;comments to the editor&rdquo; during the online submission process.</p>
   <p>6) The texts must be in Word format as follows:<br>
    (6.1) 1.5 line spacing;<br>
    (6.2) font: Times New Roman, size 12 points;<br>
    (6.3) quotations longer than three lines should be detached from the text body, single spaced, font size 10, without quotation marks and indented 4 cm from the left margin;<br>
    (6.4) justified margins with paragraphs 1.25 cm from the left margin;<br>
    (6.5) double quotation marks are only used for direct quotations in the text;<br>
    (6.6) italics are used in foreign words, neologisms, particular uses and titles of works. Bold is not used in these cases;<br>
    (6.7) underline is used only in URLs;<br>
    (6.8) the articles should be formatted for A4 paper size and have between 25,000 and 60,000 characters (with spaces), including references, notes and tables;<br>
    (6.9) the article must start with a cover sheet stating the title (up to 100 characters), abstract (between 400 and 700 characters) and five keywords; title in French, r&eacute;sum&eacute;, and five mots-cl&eacute;s (of the same size).</p>
   <p>7) References should be in the author/date format as follows: (Author's surname, year) for indirect quotations and (Author's surname, year, page) for direct quotations. Examples: (Silva, 1997) or (Silva, 1997, p.452). Different titles by the same author and year should be identified with a letter that distinguishes them. Example: (Silva, 1997a, p.452).</p>
   <p>8) References at the end of the text must comply with ABNT rules (available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ufrgs.br/faced/setores/biblioteca/referencias.html" target="_blank">http://www.ufrgs.br/faced/setores/biblioteca/referencias.html</a>[Portuguese only]). We point out to the fact that the journal does not make use (due to the electronic data retrieval) of a dash to replace the author's name to avoid repetition. Titles should not be in italics but in bold.</p>
