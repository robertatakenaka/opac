        agent.</p>
        
        <p>Submission declaration and verification Submission of an article implies that the work described has not been published previously (except in the form of an abstract or as part of a published lecture or academic thesis or as an electronic preprint, see 'Multiple, redundant or concurrent publication' section of our ethics policy for more information), that it is not under consideration for publication elsewhere, that its publication is approved by all authors and tacitly or explicitly by the responsible authorities where the work was carried out, and that, if accepted, it will not be published elsewhere in the same form, in English or in any other language, including electronically without the written consent of the copyright-holder. <b>To verify originality, your article may be checked by the originality detection service CrossCheck.</b></p>

Papers deemed suitable are then typically sent to a minimum of two independent expert reviewers to assess the scientific quality of the paper. The Editor is responsible for the final decision regarding acceptance or rejection of articles. The Editor's decision is final. More information on types of peer review.</p>

        by Elsevier.  The  paper's editors  reserve  the  right  to 

        edit  manuscripts  to  improve clarity,  grammar  and  style.  The  authors  have 

        the opportunity to  review these  changes before  the creation  of 

        the  galley proofs.  The  content changes  made after  the  galley 

        proofs  are  sent  for  review  cost will  be

      <p>Manuscripts submitted to Brazilian Journal of Infectious Diseases should 

        be sent to the editor in chief <a href="http://www.sgponline.com.br/bjid/sgp/" target="_blank">http://www.sgponline.com.br/bjid/sgp/</a> 

        address. Each manuscript will be assigned a registration number, and the 

        author will be notified that the manuscript is complete and appropriate 

        to begin the review process. 

      <p>SGP (Publication Management System) is a system that allows submission 

        of papers and of the editorial board in a fully web.  The SGP is based 

        on access levels, so when a user submits a manuscript for review and approval, 

        it remains only to display the author and the editorial board, keeping 

        it safe from other authors who have not participated in the research and 

        development work.  It is crucial that the author who submits papers 

        in the SGP has registered an email which he uses, because all the information 

        and notices concerning status, approval or refusal of work will be done 

        by email.  If the author changes the email, they can update their 

        cadastral data through the section &quot;Registration&quot; on the navigation 

        bar.  </p>

      <p>The manuscript submission process is based on nine steps of which the 

        author has been filling the items relating to his work as a title, as 

        described (keywords), abstract, additional information about the possibility 

        of sending images or graphics (in JPG format only)  and mount the 

        article content through a graphical interface page with the program similar 

        to MS Word, can be edited to create tables, insert images and apply formatting 

        to your text.  In the last step shows a PDF version of your manuscript 

        and choose to approve or delete your submission.</p>
