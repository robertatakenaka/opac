        journals will not be accepted.</p>
      <p><b><b>Revista Brasileira de Anestesiologia</b></b> classifies the articles 
        in the following categories:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>a) <b>Scientific Articles: </b>New clinical or experimental research

      <p><strong>Editorial Process</strong>: The manuscripts submitted to  the Brazilian Journal of Anesthesiology are initially evaluated by editors to verify the  content's compliance with the journal's editorial line. If any one of these aspects is considered  unsatisfactory, the manuscript is rejected and automatically archived into the  system. If it receives a positive evaluation, the manuscript proceeds to a  double-blind peer review, which ensures the anonymity of authors and reviewers.  Reviewers can rule the manuscript as accepted, rejected, or needs review  (whether in form or content). The Editors in Chief then assesses the rulings  issued by the reviewers, and the final ruling is sent to the registered author.  The corrections requested must be  submitted within 30 days. If  there is a delay in returning the proof, the Editor-in-Chief reserves the right  to publish independent of the final correction or exclude the manuscript from  the editorial process. The revised manuscript, after implementing the changes suggested by the reviewers,  should be resubmitted along with the specific indications of any changes made  to the text or the reasons why the changes were not made. The manuscripts accepted may be subjected to minor corrections or  changes which do not alter the author&rsquo;s style. Possible modifications in  format, style or interpretation will only be carried out after previous  consultation to the author.</p>
      <p>The ultimate publication will be  based on the final approval of the editors.</p>
      <p>The manuscripts denied, will be  returned with a justification of the Editor-in-Chief.</p>
      <p><strong>OBS</strong>: Author and coauthors shall sign and send  during the submission process a Copyright Cession Form to Sociedade Brasileira  de Anestesiologia and Elsevier Editora Ltda. These forms shall be sent as  separate documents (one form per author), as PDF files, through the submission  system.A template is available for download at: <a href="https://www.evise.com/evise/jrnl/bjan" target="_blank">https://www.evise.com/evise/jrnl/bjan</a>, in the Upload Files section. </p>

        or the author of the original article.</p>
      <p><b>Abbreviations: </b>Abbreviations are not recommended, except for those 
        recognized by the International System of Weights and Measures, or those 
        widely accepted in medical publications. When there are large numbers 
        of relevant abbreviations, their definitions should be presented in a 
        separate note (Glossary). Abbreviations of well established medical terms 
        should follow current traditional standards according to standard abbreviations 
        approved by the Montreal document published by the British Medical Journal, 
        1979;1:532-535.</p>
      <p><b>Drug Names:</b> The use of commercial drug names (trademarks) is not 
        re commended, but when such use is mandatory, the product name should 
        follow its generic name, in brackets, in lowercase, followed by the trademark 
        symbol (&reg;).<br>
      </p>
      <p><b>Legal an Ethical Considerations: </b>according with Uniform Requirements 
        for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals (International Committee 
        of Medical Journal Editors &#x97; February 2006).</p>
      <p><b>Conflict of Interest<br>
        </b>Conflict of interest exists when an author (or the author’s institution), 
        reviewer, or editor has financial or personal relationships that inappropriately 
        influence (bias) his or her actions (such relationships are also known 
        as dual commitments, competing interests, or competing loyalties). These 
        relationships vary from those with negligible potential to those with 
        great potential to influence judgment, and not all relationships represent 
        true conflict of interest. The potential for con flict of interest can 
        exist whether or not an individual believes that the relationship affects 
        his or her scientific judgment. Financial relationships (such as employment, 
        consultancies, stock ownership, honoraria, paid expert testimony) are 
        the most easily identifiable conflicts of interest and the most likely 
        to under mine the credibility of the journal, the authors, and of science 
        itself. However, conflicts can occur for other reasons, such as personal 
        relationships, academic competition, and intellectual passion.</p>
      <p><b>Informed Consent<br>
        </b>Patients have a right to privacy that should not be infringed without 
        informed consent. Identifying information, including patients’ names, 
        initials, or  hospital numbers, should not be published in written descriptions, 
        photographs, and pedigrees unless the information is essential for scientific 
        purposes and the patient (or parent or guardian) gives written informed 
        consent for publication. Informed consent for this purpose requires that 
        a patient who is identifiable be shown the manuscript to be published. 
        Authors should identify Individuals who provide writing assistance and 
        disclose the funding source for this assistance. </p>
      <p>Identifying details should be omitted if they are not essential. Complete 
        anonymity is difficult to achieve, however, and informed consent should 
        be obtained if there is any doubt. For example, masking the eye region 
        in photographs of patients is inadequate protection of anonymity. If identifying 
        characteristics are altered to protect anonymity, such as in genetic pedigrees, 
        authors should provide assurance that alterations do not distort scientific 
        meaning and editors should so note. </p>
      <p>When informed consent has been obtained it should be indicated in the 
        published article.</p>
      <p><b>Ethical Treatment<br>
        </b>When reporting experiments on human subjects, authors should indicate 
        whether the procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards 
        of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and 
        national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000. 
        If doubt exists whe ther the research was conducted in accordance with 
        the Helsinki Declaration, the authors must explain the rationale for their 
        approach, and demonstrate that the institutional review body explicitly 
        approved the doubtful aspects of the study. When reporting experiments 
        on animals, authors should be asked to indicate whether the institutional 
        and national guide for the care and use of laboratory animals was followed.</p>
      <p><b>Clinical Trials Registry<br>
        </b>Clinical trial must be register according WHO recommendation at <a href="http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/">www.who.int/ictrp/en/</a>. 
        The definition of clinical trial include preliminary trials (phase I): 
        any study with prospective recruiting of subjects to undergo any health-related 
        inter vention (drugs, surgical procedures, equipment, behavioral therapies, 
        food regi men, changes in health care) to evaluate the effects on clinical 
        outcomes (any biomedical or health-related parameter, including pharmacokinetics 
        measure ments and adverse reactions). </p>
      <p>The Journal has the right of not publishing trials not complying with 
        these and other legal and ethical standards determined by international 
        guidelines.</p>

        <p>b) The Editor-in-Chief forwards a copy to two members of the Editorial 
          Board for analysis;<br>
          - The co-editor is in charge of checking the thoroughness of the references.</p>
        <p>c) After the analysis, the material is sent back to the Editor-in-Chief

        <p>g) The article is sent to typesetting.</p>
        <p>h) Before publication, Editor-in-Chief and author receive a copy for 
          possible corrections.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>NOTE: It is the Editor-in-Chief's responsibility to, after hearing the 
        members of the Editorial Board and provided ethic requirements are met, 
        approve the articles to be published.</p>
      <p><b>Articles ethical aspects</b></p>
      <p>The Medical Ethical Code of the Federal Medicine Council establishes 
        strict rules for research work.</p>
      <p>We are reproducing articles 122 to 130 ruling what is forbidden in scientific 
        research.</p>
      <p><b>Physician may not:<br>
        Art. 122</b> - Participate in any type of research for war, politic, racial 
        or religious purposes.<br>
        <b> Art. 123</b> - Carry out research in humans without their written 
        consent after being duly informed about the nature and consequence of 
        the research.<br>
        <b> Sole Paragraph</b> - If patients are unable to consent, the research 
        will only be performed in their own benefit after explicit authorization 
        of their legal representatives.<br>
        <b> Art. 124 </b>- Experimentally use any type of therapy not yet approved 
        to be used in the country without the duly authorization of qualified 
        bodies and without patients (or their legal representatives) consent after 
        being duly informed about the situation and potential complications.<br>
        <b> Art. 125</b> - Promote medical research in the community without the 
        previous knowledge of such community and without aiming public health 
        protection, respected local characteristics.<br>
        <b>Art. 126</b> - Obtain personal advantages, have any commercial interest 
        or give up their professional independence vis-a-vis the sponsors of the 
        medical research they participate in.<br>
        <b> Art. 127 </b>- Carry out human research without submitting an approval 
        protocol and the follow-up of a committee with any dependence whatsoever 
        vis-a-vis those being researched.<br>
        <b> Art. 128</b> - Carry out medical research in healthy or unhealthy 
        volunteers with direct or indirect dependence or subordination vis-a-vis 
        the researcher.<br>
        <b> Art. 129</b> - Perform or participate in medical research where there 
        is the need to interrupt or withdraw proven therapy, thus hurting the 
        patient.<br>
        <b>Art. 130</b> - Carry out experiments with new clinical or surgical 
        treatments in terminal patients or those with incurable disease without 
        a reasonable hope of usefulness for the patients and not imposing them 
        additional suffering.</p>
      <p><b>Advertisers</b></p>
      <p>Throughout its 51 years, <b>Revista Brasileira de Anestesiologia</b> 
        has counted on the cooperation of laboratories and anesthesia equipment 
        manufacturers just in advertising their products without interfering in 
        the scientific publications.</p>
      <p><b>Sponsor</b></p>
      <p>It is worth underlying that <b>Revista Brasileira de Anestesiologia</b> 
        is managed by The Brazilian Society of Anesthesiology itself, which has 
        a budget and the statutory duty of publishing the journal without the 
        need of selling ads. So, the periodicity of the journal is not dependent 
        on money coming from advertisers. The budget proposal of the Society takes 
        into account expenses with the publication of regular editions of the 
        journal which is paid using part of the members fees.</p>
      <p>There is no fee for submission and review articles.</p>
      <p>The Journal  adopts iThenticate system for plagiarism identification.</p></td>
