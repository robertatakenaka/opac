      <p><strong>Copyright License</strong> <br>
The submission of a manuscript implies that  it has not been previously published, that it is not under consideration for  publication elsewhere, and that it will not be simultaneously published  elsewhere in the same format without the written permission of the Editors.  Additionally, it implies that the submitting author has the consent of all  authors. By submitting a manuscript, the authors agree that their paper's  copyright is transferred to the Brazilian Chemical Society (Sociedade  Brasileira de Qu&iacute;mica, SBQ) if and when the manuscript is accepted for  publication. Accepted manuscripts and illustrations become the property of the  SBQ.      
      <p><strong>Manuscript Organization</strong><br>
      Authors  should present their material with utmost conciseness and clarity. The&nbsp;<em>Introduction</em>&nbsp;section  should clearly and briefly identify, with relevant references, both the nature  of the problem under investigation and its background. An&nbsp;<em>Introduction</em>consisting  of an extensive literature review is not acceptable.&nbsp;      
      <p> The&nbsp;<em>Experimental</em>&nbsp;section may precede or follow the&nbsp;<em>Results  and Discussion</em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>section, but must be separated from it. The<em>Conclusions</em>&nbsp;section,  which briefly summarizes the main conclusions of the work, must be present  immediately after the&nbsp;<em>Results and Discussion</em>&nbsp;section.&nbsp;      
      <p>        Experiments should be described in sufficient detail to enable other  researchers to repeat them. The degree of purity of materials and their  quantities should be reported. Descriptions of established procedures are  unnecessary. An apparatus should be described only if it is non-standard.  Commercially available instruments should be referred to by their suppliers and  models.      
      <p> All new  compounds should be fully characterized using analytical methods, which include  spectroscopy and elemental analyses. High-resolution mass spectra may  substitute for elemental analyses if accompanied by unequivocal proof of sample  purity (melting points, copies of NMR spectra, etc.). For compounds prepared in  enantiomerically pure or enriched form, specific optical rotation must be  reported. In cases where enantiomeric excess is determined by chromatographic  and/or spectroscopic techniques, copies of the appropriate chromatograms and/or  spectra should be included as&nbsp;<em>Supplementary Material</em>&nbsp;(please  see <em>Supplementary Material</em>&nbsp;section).&nbsp;      
      <p> Many  theoretical and computational papers use a routine procedure based on a  well-documented method, be it semi-empirical or ab initio. In such cases, it is  sufficient to name the particular variant (referring to key papers in which the  method has been developed), to cite the computer program used, and to indicate  briefly any modifications made by the author.&nbsp;<br>
      It is  the authors' responsibility to obtain permission from the copyright holder for  the reproduction of figures from other publications. The obtained Copyright  Permission should be sent along with other files when submitting the  manuscript. Suitable acknowledgement of reproduction must be provided in the  captions.      
      <p> Manuscripts  written in English, considered for further evaluation, are expected to be  accompanied with a certificate from a professional editing company, attesting  that the text was submitted for a formal review of English language and  grammar. The certificate should be sent through the platform ScholarOne, when  submitting the revised version of the manuscript.
      <p><strong>Preparation of Manuscripts</strong> </p>
      <p><strong><em>General Overview</em></strong> <br>
      Times  New Roman font (12-point, black) and 1.5-line spacing should be used for the  text of the manuscript. Pages should be numbered consecutively in the bottom  right corner. Lines, titles, and subtitles of the sections must not be  numbered. Section headings should be typed in bold capital letters, the  subtitles in bold, and sub subtitles just in italics.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        <em>Supplementary Material</em>&nbsp;should be the last element of the manuscript, and should contain  relevant and complementary information to that already presented in the  manuscript (please see&nbsp;<em>Supplementary Material</em>&nbsp;section).</p>
      <p><strong><em>Section-wise Overview</em></strong> <br>
        The  first page should contain the&nbsp;<em>Graphical Abstract</em>&nbsp;(please see  the&nbsp;<em>Graphical Abstract</em>&nbsp;section), the manuscript title (upper  case and bold), the names of the authors (in bold), and the address(es) of the  institution(s) where the work was conducted. If the address of the institution  where the work was carried out is different from the present address of any of  the authors, a footnote indicating the current position of the co-author can be  included. If the authors are affiliated to different institutions, the  addresses of the institutions should be listed in a sequence and indicated by  sequential letters.</p>
      <p> Example:<br>
        <strong>Jos&eacute; A. Ben&iacute;cio</strong><strong><sup>a</sup></strong><strong>, Maria C. Cavalcante</strong><strong><sup>b</sup></strong><strong>&nbsp;e Jo&atilde;o D. de Almeida</strong><strong><sup>a</sup>,</strong><strong>*</strong>&nbsp;<br>
        <sup>a</sup>Departamento  de Qu&iacute;mica, Universidade Estadual de Maring&aacute;, 87020-900 Maring&aacute;-PR, Brasil<br>
        <sup>b</sup>Departamento  de Qu&iacute;mica Fundamental, Instituto de Qu&iacute;mica, Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo,  05508-000 S&atilde;o Paulo-SP, Brasil<br>
        *e-mail: jalmeida@dq.uem.br</p>
      <p> The  first unit of the address should be the department where the work was  conducted, following which the faculty/institute, university, zip code, city,  and country should be indicated.&nbsp;<u>Laboratory, postgraduate programs, and  courses should not be included in the address</u>. As shown in the example, the  corresponding author should be indicated with an asterisk (*) and her/his email  address placed right after the address(es). The second page should contain the  title and abstract of the work, both in English. The length of an&nbsp;<em>Abstract</em>&nbsp;should  not exceed two hundred (200) words. In addition, 3-5&nbsp;<em>keywords</em>&nbsp;(<em>keywords</em>),  also in English, should be included below the abstract. The text should start  from the third page of the manuscript.&nbsp;</p>
      <p> Throughout  the text, the author should note the following rules:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Words or phrases in Latin or in a language different from that used in  the manuscript should be in italics.</li>
        <li>Scientific names of species should be in italics, with the first letter  of the name in upper case.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Examples:&nbsp;<br>
        The experiments were conducted&nbsp;<em>in situ</em>;&nbsp;<br>
        The  bacterium&nbsp;<em>Escherichia coli</em>.;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>All units must be separated from the respective values using a single  space (including degree Celsius). The same rule should be applied to units in  sequence.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Examples:<br>
        10 &ordm;C;<br>
  &nbsp;15 mg L<sup>&minus;1</sup>&nbsp;(avoid mg/L);<br>
        10 m s<sup>&minus;2</sup>&nbsp;(avoid m/s<sup>2</sup>);<br>
  <strong>Attention:</strong>&nbsp;all  nomenclature should be consistent, clear, unambiguous, and in accordance with  the nomenclature rules established by the IUPAC, the International Union of  Biochemistry, the Abstracts Service, the Nomenclature Committee of the American  Chemical Society, or other appropriate bodies. Units and symbols should follow  IUPAC recommendations. Authors should avoid the use of units that are not part  of the SI.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Guidelines for Graphical Elements and Tables</em></strong> <br>
          <strong>Graphs and Figures:</strong>&nbsp;texts, axis labels, and any other textual information accompanying  the graphic elements throughout the work should be consistent with regards to  the source, font size, spacing, and color. For computer-generated artwork, a  colored background or shading is discouraged.</p>
      <p>          <strong>Structural Formulas and Chemical Equation</strong>s: all chemical structures and equations  should have the same font throughout the manuscript.<br>
          <strong>Equations:</strong>&nbsp;equations  throughout the manuscript should be created using an equation editor (e.g.,  MathType, Equation) and should be numbered consecutively using arabic numerals.</p>
      <p>          <strong>Photographs:&nbsp;</strong>photographs should be highly contrasted, positive, and not mounted. When  necessary, the scale should be indicated on the photograph itself, not below.  No photos of commercial equipment will be accepted.</p>
      <p>          <strong>Tables:&nbsp;</strong>tables should be formatted to provide information to the reader in a  straightforward manner. Shades of color and bold lettering are discouraged.  Authors should indicate any extra information as a footnote with superscripted  letters (e.g., a, b, c) at the appropriate locations.</p>
      <p>          <strong><em>Graphical Abstract</em></strong><strong>:&nbsp;</strong>the  figure should summarize the content of the manuscript in a concise, pictorial  form, and should be designed to capture the attention of a wide readership. The  author should not duplicate a graphic from the main text of the article but  present a new figure based on a key structure, reaction, equation, concept,  graphic, theorem, etc. Artistic and imaginative use of colors in the&nbsp;<em>Graphical  Abstract</em>&nbsp;is encouraged. The use of photos of commercial equipment is  not appropriate.</p>
      <p>          <strong>Attention</strong>: the  high-resolution image (*.tiff /*.jpg or other formats that can be edited)  should fit in an area no larger than 8 cm (width) by 4 cm (height) [<strong>the  author should ensure that the annotations in the image are readable at these  dimensions</strong>]. Along with the figure for&nbsp;<em>Graphical Abstract</em>, a  short explanatory text (three lines, at the most) should be included below it.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Guidelines for Citations and Reference list</em></strong> <br>
      Graphical  elements and tables should be numbered and cited in text using the full form of  word (the use of abbreviations is discouraged) where the first letter is in  uppercase.&nbsp;</p>
      <p> Examples:<br>
        . as seen on Figure 1. (do not use Fig. 1)<br>
        Table 2  shows the obtained results. (do not use Tab. 2)<br>
      All&nbsp;<em>references</em>&nbsp;should  be numbered consecutively in the order of their first citation in text as  superscripted numerals after punctuation, without parentheses or brackets. Two  or more&nbsp;<em>references</em>&nbsp;cited together should be separated by  commas. Citations of three or more consecutive&nbsp;<em>references</em>&nbsp;should  be grouped together, using the hyphen (-).</p>
      <p> Examples:<br>
        sodium salicylate,<sup>1-3</sup><br>
        Nishide&nbsp;<em>et  al.</em>,<sup>4</sup><br>
        by  reduction of chromic acid.<sup>4-8,12,14 </sup><br>
      In  the&nbsp;<em>References</em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>section, the journal title abbreviations  should be those used in the Chemical Abstracts Service Source Index (<a href="http://cassi.cas.org/" target="_blank">http://cassi.cas.org</a>). If the journal is not listed in CASSI, the full title of the journal  should be typed.</p>
      <p> The  format for year, volume, and pages presented below for various types of  literature should be followed. Punctuation, spacing, and regular/bold/italics  font-type should be checked carefully. Manuscripts with&nbsp;<em>references&nbsp;</em>that  do not adhere to the norms of the journal will be returned to the author until  the errors are checked and corrected.</p>
      <p> Examples:<br>

      Whenever  a compound is synthesized or identified (new or already known), it is  imperative that spectral data (data and spectra) as&nbsp;<em>Supplementary  Material</em>&nbsp;(see&nbsp;<em>Supplementary Material</em>&nbsp;section) is  submitted along with the manuscript.</p>
      <p>        <strong><em>Supplementary Material</em></strong> <br>
        This  resource was created so that the main text of the manuscript would contain only  the strictly necessary figures and tables.&nbsp;<br>
      Contents for&nbsp;<em>Supplementary Material</em>&nbsp;should be placed at the  end of the manuscript, after the&nbsp;<em>References</em>&nbsp;section. Whenever  the<em>Supplementary Material</em>&nbsp;is present, a section named&nbsp;<em>Supplementary  Material</em>, describing its content, should be created in the main text of the  manuscript right after&nbsp;<em>Conclusions</em>. The text should also indicate  the free access to the&nbsp;<em>Supplementary Material</em>at&nbsp;<em>Qu&iacute;mica  Nova</em>&nbsp;website (<a href="http://www.quimicanova.sbq.org.br/" target="_blank">http://www.quimicanova.sbq.org.br/</a>).&nbsp;</p>
      <p> Graphical  elements and tables for&nbsp;<em>Supplementary Material</em>&nbsp;should be  sequentially numbered as in the following examples: Figure 1S, Figure 2S, Table  1S, Table 2S.</p>
      <p> The&nbsp;<em>Supplementary  Material</em>&nbsp;is a separate document. If references are used, they should  be listed at the end of the<em>Supplementary Material</em>&nbsp;and numbered as  1S, 2S, etc.</p>
    <p> Editors,  at any time of the editing process, may ask authors to remove portion(s) of the  manuscript and include it in the<em>Supplementary Material</em>.</p></td>

      <ol>
        <li><em>Main document</em>&nbsp;(full.doc), including all figures and tables (including their  captions), should be inserted after their first mention in the text. This file  should be created using the available template. If the manuscript  contains&nbsp;<em>Supplementary Material</em>, it should be added at the end of  the main document.</li>
        <li>All original files of figures (including the&nbsp;<em>Graphical Abstract</em>)  should be uploaded in any of the following formats: jpg, tiff, opj, xls, cdx,  etc. For example, if the manuscript has six figures, you must individually  upload each of the six original files, along with the&nbsp;<em>main document</em>&nbsp;that  already contains all the figures.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Note:<br>
        - figures that are images must have high resolution (minimum 300 dpi);<br>
        - do not send the figures inserted into a  .doc file. Send all the original files individually (in opj, xls, tiff, etc.  formats). This will expedite the review of your manuscript and publication  process on acceptance.</p>
      <p>Warning: From the second issue of vol. 38 onwards, Qu&iacute;mica Nova will be printed only in black and White, except for graphical abstracts. When composing the figures, one should keep in mind that they will be converted at the time of printing, avoiding loss of information based solely on the colors.
