      <p>The  editorial policy of <strong>Psychology USP</strong> is based on the universality and diversity  of the psychological science, and considers it important to articulate  different types and different fields of knowledge or scientific disciplines.  Therefore, the journal publishes articles and essays, which focus essentially  on original reflections on the relevant literature. It implies that reflections  should not be merely descriptive of concepts or empirical data. The manuscript  must contain interpretation, which takes as references, philosophical and  scientific theories.</p>
      <p>Although  all manuscripts should base their main contributions to the psychological field  on theoretical reflections, research reports are also accepted, provided that  they contain data interpretation based on consolidated theories. Such  interpretation must indicate its own determinations and its continuity and/or  rupture from the current trends in the field of study. The journal publishes  original articles and essays, evidenced by the peculiar way of addressing a  scientific problem, the depth of the theoretical discussion or the extension of  a theory or method to a new research object.</p>
      <p>For  this journal, an essay has similarities and distinctions from an artistic text  and a scientific article. It is similar from an artistic text by means of the  re(a)presentation of the object to be studied, which must be analyzed through  the proximity of the subject to it; it is similar from the latter by the use of  empirical data and/ or theories, which require the distancing of the subject  from the object in order to be able to think about it. Also, an essay differs  from both. It is not a literary text since the object re(a)presented by mimesis  is not generated by fantasy; and it is neither a purely scientific text, for it  does not attempt to proceed from the simple to the most complex, it does not  divide the object of analysis, it does not have a systematic method of analysis  to be generalizable to other studies.</p>
      <p>Articles  should keep the theoretical accuracy of the disciplines that sustain the study,  but should not lose sight of the communication with readers from other areas.  Thus, the articles should not be written only for specialists, nor lose their  accuracy.</p>
    <p>Both  essays and articles can make use of concepts from different disciplines with  the intent to relate them, not to confuse them. In this case, concepts from  different areas are related in order to better understand the object; thereby,  they are hardly&nbsp;relatable&nbsp;in a direct manner,&nbsp;so the elements  that&nbsp;are not&nbsp;relatable&nbsp;should be highlighted as not  to&nbsp;lose&nbsp;the specificity of concepts.</p></td>

      <p><strong>Psicologia USP</strong>&nbsp;is  based on American Psychological Association Manual (APA, 6th edition, 2010)  regarding citations and references. All contributions must comply with this  information and obey to the following order:</p>       
      <p>1 -<strong> Format</strong>:  the contributions must be presented in .doc or  .docx extension, font Times New Roman, body 12, page size A4 (21.0 for 29.7  cm), double lining space, margins of 2.5 cm, limited to <strong>50.000 (fifty thousand) characters with spaces, including all  versions of abstract.</strong></p>       
      <p>2 &#150; <strong>Unidentifed title page</strong>: it must contain  only the title in Portuguese, English, Spanish, and French.</p>       
      <p>3 - <strong>Abstracts</strong>:  they must be up to 150 words and be presented in Portuguese (resumo), English  (abstract), Spanish (resumen) and French (resum&eacute;). The abstract in the  article's original language must be typed in the respective field in the step 1  of the submission process.</p>       
      <p>4 &#150; <strong>Keywords</strong>:  there must be up to five keywords, immediately below of each one of the  abstracts, in Portuguese (Palavras-chave), Spanish (Palabras-clabe), English  (Keywords) and French (Mots-cl&eacute;s). The keywords in Portuguese must be selected  of the list presented by the online submission platform and translated into  English, Spanish, and French.</p> 
      <p>5 &#150; <strong>Text</strong> </p>      
      <p>Every work cited in the text must be in accordance  with the information presented below, both direct citations (textual  transcription of words or text passages from the work in question) and indirect  citations (transcription of ideas based on the work of the consulted author).</p>       
      <p>Some Latin expressions, such as idem (id.), ibidem  (ibid), opus citatum (op. cit.) are not accepted by the journal.</p>       
      <p>It is the author's responsibility the correct  presentation and accuracy of the citations in the text. Every work cited in the  text should be set out in the references.</p>       
      <p><strong>Citation of author in the text</strong></p>       
      <p>The citations must be elaborated according to the  author-date system. This demands that the author's surname and the publishing  date of the work being cited be inserted in the text, in appropriate place,  according to the following information:</p>       
      <p>- If the author appears as part of the narrative, just  the year is cited in parenthesis. In other cases, the surname and the year are  cited, separated by comma, in parenthesis.</p>       
      <p>Examples:</p>       
      <p>Saussure (1995) defines the linguistic sign&#133;</p>
      <p>This is roughly the basal logic of psychoanalysis (Roussillon, 1999).</p>       
      <p>- When the year and the author are presented as part  of the narrative, no information should be presented in parenthesis. </p>      
      <p>Example:</p>      
      <p>In 2007, Santos  contradicted this affirmation&#133;</p>
      <p>- In the same paragraph, when the author is part  of the narrative, the year must not be included in all citations. It must be  included only when the citation is in parenthesis. Example:</p>      
      <p>Potter (1991) says that we can understand  memory&#133; That being said, Potter's first explication for the process of  forgetting&#133; Nowadays (Potter, 1991).</p>      
      <p>- For work with two authors: Ades e Botelho  (1993) or (Ades &amp; Botelho, 1993).</p>      
      <p>- in the case of citations with three to five  authors, in the first time they appear in the text all the authors are cited;  in the following citations, the surname of the first author is succeeded by the  expression &#34;et al.&#34;. Examples: Haase, Diniz, and Cruz, 1997 or (Haase, Diniz,  &amp; Cruz, 1997). In the following citations: Haase et al. (1997) or (Hasse et  al., 1997). In the final list of references the names of all the authors must  be cited.</p>     
      <p>- In the case of citations with six or more  authors, it is presented the surname of the first author followed by the  expression &#34;et al.&#34;. Example: Hays et al. (2002). In the final list of  references the names of the first six authors is followed by suspension points  and the name of the last author.</p>  
      <p>- In citations of various authors and one same  idea, one must obey to alphabetical order of surnames. Examples: Badaines  (1976), Biller (1968, 1969O) or (Badaine, 1976; Biller, 1968, 1969).</p>      
      <p>- In the case of documents with different date  of publishing and one same author, one cites the surname of the author and the  years of publishing in chronological order. Example: Merleau-Ponty (1942, 1960,  1966).</p>      
      <p>- In citations of distinct words, but with the  same publishing date and same author, lower case letters must be added after  the year of publishing. Example: Rogers  (1973a, 1973b, 1973c).</p>      
      <p>- In documents which author is a collective  entity, the entry must be made by the entity's name in full, followed by the  year of publishing. Example: American Psychological Association (2001) or  (American Psychological Association, 2001).</p>     
      <p><strong>Citation of old and reissued works</strong></p>  
      <p>- One must indicate the year of the original  publishing followed by the date of the consulted edition.</p> 
      <p>Examples: Freud (1898/1976) or (Freud, 1898/1976).</p>
      <p><strong>Direct or textual citation</strong></p>      
      <p>- The literal transcription of a text must appear  between double quotes, followed by the author&rsquo;s surname, date and page of  citation. Example: According to Freitas (2002), the &#34;individuals represent the  reality from the condition in which they live&#34; (p. 75). The spelling and  punctuation of a textual citation must obey to those used by the author of the cited  document.</p>      
      <p>- In the citation of a passage with 40 words or more,  it must be presented in a separated block of text without double quotes,  beginning in a new line with indentation from the left margin of approximately 1.3 cm (equivalent to a  paragraph) and ending in a margin without indentation.</p>      
      <p>- In the citation of a testimony or the transcription  of an interview, the text must be presented italicized and following the above  orientation for textual citation.</p>      
      <p>For other examples we recommend the APA Style Manual  or the APA site: <a href="www.apa.org" target="_blank">www.apa.org</a></p>
      <p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>      
      <p>- Footnotes must be avoided whenever possible. However,  when presented in the body of text they must be indicated with Arabic numerals,  immediately after the sentence with which they relate. They are presented at  the bottom of the same page. The references of works cited in the text should  be recorded at the end of the text and not in footnotes.</p>
      <p>6 - <strong>References</strong>:  they must be presented at the end of the text. Its disposition obeys to  alphabetical order of the author last name and it is constituted of a list  entitled &#34;References&#34;. In the case of more than a work by the same author, the  references should be arranged in chronological order of publication. Examples:</p>

    <td width="70%"><p>In line with our editorial policy, ethical issues related to scientific  plagiarism occupy a central position in the publishing process adopted by the <em>Psicologia USP</em> journal. We understand  that intellectual production should be authorial and linked to political  positions, even if not at first glance.  Any attempts to minimize its importance, including under the appearance of  unrestricted scientific neutrality, tend to separate the production and  disclosure of knowledge from the social purposes it should meet. If,  contradictorily, knowledge can serve both domination and freedom, the  reflection expressed in originality and commitment to knowledge for the  development of a humanity permeated by fairness and equanimity can help us  distinguish between its instrumentalization based on practices that may not be  appropriate for scientific purposes and, on the other hand, its critical  achievement in favor of freedom of thought.</p>
      <p> Inspired by the need for constant reflection, avoiding the trend of  reflecting oneself of the automatism of repetition of patterns, <em>Psicologia USP </em>is positioned against the  various forms of plagiarism, repudiating any attempts of misappropriating the  products of the intellectual work of others.&nbsp;Furthermore, we consider that even self-plagiarism  should be rejected when answering to overproduction interests poorly committed  to the responsible and necessary development and sharing of knowledge. We  recommend that the originality of the studies submitted for  assessment/publication is considered regarding both the copyright  sources of the developed contents and referred to considering the formal  aspects of writing. This implies the need for actual participation of coauthors  in coauthored papers be carefully considered, including in cases of  participation of advisors and scientific research coordinators. Also, we  recommend caution regarding the development of papers derived from academic  research of master’s, PhD, post-doctorate, and others, so that the author(s) do  not incur in self-plagiarism. Even in cases in which the paper is inspired by  or derived from research in the strict sense, it is important that the source  of the content, safeguarded the identity of the author(s) during the evaluation  process, be properly indicated and the text presented effectively original.</p>
    <p>To ensure compliance with such precepts, <em>Psicologia USP</em> takes as inspiration the  conduct principles and plagiarism policy drawn up by the Committee on  Publications Ethics - COPE (<a href="https://publicationethics.org/" target="_blank">https://publicationethics.org</a>). From 2017, we adopted a specific software,  especially the software SimilarityCheck - CrossRef, to prove that there is no  textual or content similarity between the material submitted to  assessment/publication and other publications, including by the same author(s).</p></td>
