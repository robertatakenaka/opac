      <p>The complete manuscript should comply with the  following sequence: title, abstract, key words, introduction, material and  methods, results and discussion, acknowledgements, references,&nbsp;and tables  and figures. The manuscript must be typed in Word for Windows, in times new  roman 12, double spacing, format A4, with 20 mm margins and consecutive top  right numbering.&nbsp;The double spaced text must not exceed 18 pages,  including separately placed tables and figures (one a page) in the end of text.  All the equations, models and simbols should be made in Microsoft Equation. The  title should be clear, concise, and express the gist of the article. It should  not surpass 15 words, be typed in bold, left, with initial upper case letters.  The authors’ complete names, and their institutional addresses should be  entered in the proof read. The abstract should not contain more than 150 words.  A maximum of 5 key words,&nbsp;different from the title, are allowed. The  introduction should include a brief literature review on subject and aims of  the study. Material and Methods must enable other researchers to repeat the  experience. Preferentially, Results and Discussion should be presented together  for easiness of reading. Acknowledgements should be succinct, and limited to  effective co-workers and financing agencies.</p>
      <p> Be carefull about the references. Never cite  summaries of events and&nbsp;theses, or any other unpublished literature.

        Leading authors of certain topics will be asked for a Review by the Editorial 

        Board (also restricted to 18 pages), which should shed light specifically 

        on stirring subject matters that deserve a deeper analysis into their 

        stage of development. </p>

      <p><b>Notes</b><br>

        Notes are limited to 12 pages and designated to inform about new studies 

        or observations, wherefore the analytical tools are not required. They 

        may focus on a matter of broad interest; briefly describe an original 

        study; report on participatory research; express observations of special 

        interest in the fields of research, teaching, and applied sciences; or 

        comment on the release of new software in a plant breeding-related area. 

      </p>

      <p><b>Plant breeding programs</b></p>

      <p>Outstanding breeding programs regarding innovation, efficiency, impact, 

        and/or continuity can be portrayed in the CBAB, restricted to 18 pages. 

      </p>

      <p><b>Cultivars release</b></p>

      <p>New cultivars deserve special attention for their key role in plant breeding, 

        and consequently, for domestic agriculture. A contribution to this section 

        should comprise an abstract of maximally 50 words, key words, an introduction, 

        mention the applied improvement methods, performance characteristics, 

        foundation seed production, and contain a minimum of references (follow 

        examples of articles references), tables, and figures. The entire text 

        should not exceed 12 pages.</p>
        <p><em><b>Software/Device release</b></em></p>
        <p>New softwares and devices are going to be published in the Special section because of the importance they represent for the current improvement and, therefore, for agriculture. This new section must contain Abstracts limited to 50 words, Key words, introduction, methods, history used for the development of the manuscript, performance characteristics, applications, forms of access and a minimum of references, tables and figures. The entire manuscript will be limited to 12 pages.</p>

      <p><b>Book review</b></p>

      <p>This new section was created to announce new books related to plant breeding. 

        A contribution to this section should comprise two copies of the book 

        sent in by the Author. The book will be revised by an expertise referee 

        chosen by the Editorial Board to edit a brief.</p>
