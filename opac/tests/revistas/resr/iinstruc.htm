      <p>1 - The Brazilian Journal of Rural  Economics and Sociology (RESR) accepts original scientific manuscripts, written  in Portuguese, English or in Spanish, related to agriculture, agribusiness and  rural issues. Articles from other areas will have their relevance judge by the  editors.</p>
      <p>2 &ndash; To ensure anonymity during the  evaluation process of the article, authors should not be identified in the text  and should avoid any reference to their institution. The identification and  institutional affiliation of the authors will be filled in on the appropriate  field on the journal's website, and will only be accessible by the Editorial  Board and editors of RESR.</p>
      <p>3 &ndash; Each text can have 5 (five)  authors, at most.</p>
      <p>4 &ndash; Authors can submit 2 (two)  manuscripts per year, as first author or as co-author.</p>
      <p>5 &ndash; Submitted manuscripts will be  subject to a preliminary review by the editors, who will decide whether they  should be sent to referees or not. The authors will be informed of this  decision by email. If the manuscript is approved by the editors, it will then  be reviewed by two external referees under the &quot;blind review&quot; system.  In case of conflicting opinions, the editors will judge the manuscript and may  consult the Editorial Board. In all cases, a decision to accept, reject, or  request a revised manuscript will be communicated electronically to the authors,  with a summary of the referees' evaluations.</p>
      <p>6 &ndash; The manuscripts should be  organized, to the extent possible, in the following manner: Title (maximum 17  words), Abstract (maximum 200 words), Introduction, Theoretical Foundation,  Methodology, Results and Discussion, Conclusions, Bibliography, and Keywords.  Keywords must follow the Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) Classification  System. The manuscripts must be in &ldquo;doc&rdquo; or &ldquo;docx&rdquo; format and they can not be  protected. Files which do not follow this format will be denied. </p>
      <p>7 &ndash; The text must be simple-spaced,  including footnotes, tables, references and annexes, and should be formatted  preferably for A4 paper, with a minimum margin of 2.5 cm and 12-point font  (Times New Roman). The RESR will not accept manuscripts with more than 20  simple-spaced pages.</p>
      <p>8 &ndash; Tables and graphs should be sent  in a separate file, Word or Excel, in <b>black  and white</b> and with resolution up to 300dpi. They will be putin the standard  RESR format if the manuscript is accepted for publication.</p>
      <p>9 &ndash; Tables and figures (including  illustrations and photographs) should be sent in a separate file with a maximum  resolution of 300dpis, in black and white, ready for direct insertion in the  text.</p>
      <p>10 &ndash; The author(s) should cite the  sources of the data and models used and explain the methodology and estimation  procedures adopted. The Footnotes should be numbered consecutively throughout  the text. The References should follow the specifications adopted by the ABNT  and be listed alphabetically at the end of the article. Only the references  cited in the manuscript should be included.<br>
        See the site: <a href="http://www.abnt.org.br/">http://www.abnt.org.br/</a> </p>
      <p>11 &ndash; Authors are requested to send a  letter to the Editorial Board of RESR, indicating if the text is a result of a  graduation course study, master or doctorate, a research project of a research  group, among other possibilities. There is also the need to detail financing  sources, research and coordination teams, duration of the project and if there  are preliminary versions released in scientific events. In this letter, the  SIGNATURE of all AUTHORS is necessary. The letter has to be included in  Scielo&rsquo;s online system, as &ldquo;Supplementary Document&rdquo;. Submissions that do not  follow this requirement will not be forwarded to referees. </p>
      <p>12 &ndash; Once revisions have been made  based on the referee reports, the author(s) should resubmit the revised  manuscript to the editors through the online system. The editors may choose to  send the manuscript back to referees for a second round of review. The editors  will then decide to accept or reject the manuscript.</p>
      <p>13 &ndash; The ideas and opinions  expressed in the published articles are the authors' responsibility and do not,  necessarily, reflect the views and opinions of the editors and/or SOBER.</p>
      <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b></p>
      <p>It is suggested that, before the  submission, authors read and evaluate their papers answering the questions  below, which increases chances for the manuscript to be accepted for  publication. In case any answer is negative, arguments are recommended in order  to explain the reason for that.</p>
      <p>1. If the manuscript has preliminary  versions presented in research conferences and seminars, does this version  include suggested contributions?</p>
      <p>2. What is the important  contribution that the manuscript brings for the knowledge in the research area?</p>
      <p>3. Does the paper mention other  manuscripts released in Brazilian and international scientific journals?</p>
      <p>4. Does the manuscript mention  papers published in scientific journals over the last five years?</p>
      <p>5. Does your paper present  references and quotes from classic authors in the field of work?</p>
      <p>6. Does your manuscript follow rules  from RESR editorial board?</p>
      <p>7. The methodology for research and  the theoretical apparatus used are described in a desirable way?</p>
    8. Did your paper face a  grammatical revision?</td>
