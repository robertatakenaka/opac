    <td WIDTH="70%"><p>The&nbsp;<strong>Revista Brasileira de Ci&ecirc;ncia do Solo</strong>&nbsp;(RBCS)  is a journal that publishes peer-reviewed manuscripts, edited by the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sbcs.org.br/">Sociedade Brasileira de Ci&ecirc;ncia  do Solo</a>&nbsp;(SBCS). The RBCS aims to disseminate  original and relevant contributions in different areas of Soil Science.<br>
      The publications are organized in  Scientific&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rbcs.org.br/sections/">Divisions and Commissions</a>,  in accordance with those adopted by the SBCS and the International Union of  Soil Sciences (IUSS).</p>
      <p>The journal began to be published in  1977 in a non-continuous format. After 1996, three numbers started to be  published annually. During 1997 to 2002 and 2003 to 2015, the journal  periodicity was four and six numbers published per year, respectively. During  all these years, the journal was published in the printed form.<br>
        In 2016 the RBCS was submitted to a significant  restructuring, when the journal adopted the electronic format; moved to a  continuous publication model; the manuscripts exclusively published in English,  although it was optional since 2007; the editorial and the manuscripts review  process board was restructured; and, although RBCS had adopted electronic  submission since 2007, which was performed through its own software, in 2015  the journal adopted ScholarOne, an internationally known online submission and  paper management system.</p>
      <p>The journal management is performed by  the Editorial Board, which is composed by the Editor-in-Chief, Co-Editor,  Technical Editor, Associate Editors, and Area Editors.<br>
        The submitted manuscripts are forwarded  to technical pre-screening, which is conducted by the technical editor. In this  stage, a general check is performed to ensure that the manuscript: i) is  complete (i.e. title page, cover letter, main document, figures, and tables);  ii) complies with instructions provided in the Guide for Authors; iii) is  within of journal scope; and iv) is original, which means that the manuscript  will be checked by an originality detection service &ndash; Crossref Similarity  Check. Submitted papers not meeting these requirements will be returned to the  authors who may re-submit their paper after corrections.<br>
        A manuscript with accepted submission  is assigned to one of the Area Editors (AreaEd). The Area Editors may endorse  or not the manuscript suitability to the journal scope and, additionality,  he/she examines, in a general way, if the manuscript contributes with new  knowledge to the Soil Science.<br>
        If the AreaEd considers the manuscript  suitable, he/she will forward the manuscript to the Associate Editor (AE). The  AE assesses if the specific scientific merit is attended, and then it will be  sent to, at least, three&nbsp;<em>ad hoc</em>&nbsp;reviewers  with appropriate knowledge, skills, methodological expertise, and experience to  assess the manuscript. Based on the comments of, at least, two reviewers and on  its own experience,, the AE recommends if the manuscript should be rejected,  accepted, or needs revision before acceptance for publication. This decision  will be endorsed or not by the AreaEd. The final decision is taken by the  Editor-in-Chief, based on AE and AreaEd recommendations. Manuscripts, whose  processing were interrupted by the AreaEd and AE, will also be forwarded to  Editor-in-Chief gives the final decision. Other attributions under  Editor-in-Chief responsibility are: to coordinate activities developed by  AreaEd, AE, and reviewers; and keep a communication channel with the authors.<br>
        The manuscript processing is conducted  without anonymity until reaching the AE, which means that identities are not  disclosed only between authors and&nbsp;<em>ad hoc</em>&nbsp;reviewers.<br>
        After the manuscript is published, all  the publication rights are reserved to the RBCS. The manuscripts will be  available at the journal website (www.rbcs.org.br) and in online libraries,  such as SciELO (www.scielo.br) and Redalyc (www.redalyc.org), or any other  database in which RBCS becomes indexed in the future.<br>
        The RBCS applies the Creative Commons  (CC BY) license to published manuscripts. This license allows others to use,  reproduce, disseminate, or display the article in any way, including for  commercial purposes, so long as they credit the author for the original  creation.<br>
        Authors are responsible for all ideas  and information presented in the manuscripts, which may not necessarily reflect  the views of the RBCS&rsquo;s Editors and Editorial Board.</p>
To promote the widest-possible visibility of your  research and to inspire new research focused on Soil Science, the RBCS  encourages to deposit the data published in the manuscripts in open access  repositories. Suggested repositories: The Free Brazilian Repository for Open  Soil Data (febr) (<a href="http://www.ufsm.br/febr">http://www.ufsm.br/febr</a>)  and/or Hydrophysical Database for Brazilian Soils (<a href="http://www.cprm.gov.br/publique/Hidrologia/Pesquisa-e-Inovacao/HYBRAS-4930.html">http://www.cprm.gov.br/publique/Hidrologia/Pesquisa-e-Inovacao/HYBRAS-4930.html</a>).
