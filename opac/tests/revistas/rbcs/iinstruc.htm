   <p><strong>Language</strong><br>
Before submitting your manuscript  to the RBCS, we recommended a professional edition of your paper, particularly  if English is not your native language. This is not mandatory but may ensure  that the scientific content is fully understood by the editors and reviewers. Even  after approval, the editors/reviewers may request, if necessary, a text revision  by one of the specialists indicated herein. Manuscripts with inappropriate  English will have its review process interrupted/rejected by the Editor or  reviewer.</p>
   <p><strong>Exclusivity and  originality</strong></p>
   <p>Manuscripts submitted or  published, even partially, in another journal are not accepted. The exclusivity  must be declared in the cover letter. Only manuscripts whose content has been  published in the form of an abstract, a published lecture or academic  thesis/dissertation/monography are accepted. Nonconformities of the manuscript  regarding exclusivity and originality will be the sole responsibility of the  corresponding author.</p>
   <p><strong>Conflict of  interest</strong></p>
   <p>In the cover letter, declare absence  (or declare if any) of conflict of interest associated with financial and  personal support or of any other nature which has influenced the manuscript content. </p>
   <p><strong>Authors</strong><br>
     All authors must have an Open  Researcher and Contributor Identifier (ORCID iD - https://orcid.org/register),  which will be required during the submission to ScholarOneTM. The  corresponding author must declare in the cover letter that all authors are  aware of and approved the manuscript submission. The manifestation of  unawareness or disagreement with the submission by anyone of the authors will  result in the interruption of the manuscript. It is not allowed to change the  corresponding author. Any addition, deletion or rearrangement of author names  in the authorship list should be made before the manuscript is accepted. The  contribution of each author to the proposal, implementation, data analysis, and  writing of the manuscript must also be declared in the title page.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <p><strong>Manuscript</strong><br>
     Manuscripts must be in accordance  with the standards for scientific writing. The publication of an experiment in  parts (fractionation of the content) should be avoided, but if it proves  necessary the manuscripts should be submitted in sequence, and this fact must  be informed in their corresponding cover letters. </p>
   <p>RBCS accepts the following  manuscripts types: </p>
   <p><strong><em>Original research papers (Regular  papers) &ndash;</em></strong> Should be based on an original scientific hypothesis,  which was not yet clarified. The hypothesis must be tested through  experimentation and/or theoretical models, based on the scientific method, with  adequate statistical planning and discussion. Priority will be given to manuscripts  that contribute to the understanding of processes and mechanisms occurring in  the soil. Comparisons of methods, varieties, types of management, etc. may, exceptionally,  be considered as a scientific article only when they provide a basis and/or logical  scientific reason; if they solve an important problem in the field; or if there  is a significant conceptual advance. The article structure must contain: title,  highlights, abstract, keywords, introduction, materials and methods, results, discussion  (results and discussion cannot be presented together in the same section &ndash;  Results and Discussion), conclusions, references and may contain tables and figures.  Supplementary material is allowed (see Submission).</p>
   <p><strong><em>Short communication &ndash; </em></strong>Describes significant  advances and innovative aspects of a technique or equipment/instrument; a new  species or observations; and data surveys limited to non-repeatable experiments  or other unique situations. It is not an article of inferior quality and it has  the same scientific value of an original research publication. This type of  manuscript is, in general, shorter than the scientific article. It may not have  the conventional structure required to original research papers, but it must  obey the same scientific rigor. Adding supplementary material is also allowed.</p>
   <p><strong><em>Review articles </em></strong>&ndash; This type of  manuscript may be submitted spontaneously or invited by the Editor-in-chief,  but both will undergo the same review process to be approved. Besides reporting  the state of knowledge on a specific topic, review articles should be  analytical and critical and present suggestions for future research.</p>
   <strong><em>Letter to the editor - </em></strong>It should contain relevant communication to the Soil  Science community or a critique on a manuscript published by RBCS. In the  latter case, the right of counter argument will be granted to the authors. </td>

   <p>All manuscripts must be submitted  online through ScholarOneTM, an online submission and paper  management system, which can be accessed using the following links:<br>
     <a href="http://www.rbcs.org.br">www.rbcs.org.br</a> <br>
     <a href="http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_serial&pid=0100-0683&lng=en&nrm=iso">http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_serial&amp;pid=0100-0683&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso</a> <br>
     <a href="https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/rbcs-scielo">https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/rbcs-scielo</a>. <br>
The following files at submission  must be uploaded: cover letter, title page, and main document. Tables, figures,  and supplemental file are optional. </p>
   <p><strong>Formatting  requirements</strong><br>
     All documents should be created  using a word processing software, preferably the Microsoft Word. The text  should be left aligned, written with 12-point font, and with a 1.5 line spacing  throughout the entire document. Manuscripts should be prepared without line numbering,  since the online submission system will do it automatically when converting the  submitted files to a single PDF file used in the peer-review process.</p>
   <p><strong>Cover letter</strong><br>
     The cover letter must contain: 1)  manuscript title; 2) a statement that the paper is original and neither the  manuscript nor any part of its content was published previously in print form  or electronically, and are not under consideration by any other journal or  electronic medium; 3) a statement certifying that all authors approved the  manuscript being submitted; 4) a statement that there is no conflict of interest  (financial, personal or institutional) associated with the information and  results disclosed in the manuscript; and 5) information about the manuscript  relevance; the authors must indicate the suitability of the manuscript within  the scope of the RBCS, and highlight the problem, hypothesis, objectives, and  to emphasize the main findings and why they are significant to increasing Soil  Science knowledge.</p>
   <p><strong>Title page</strong><br>
     The title page must contain the  manuscript title, authors names without abbreviation and without an academic  degree. Present the current authors&rsquo; affiliation addresses below the names, indicating  without abbreviation and translation the Institution (University, Institute,  Research Center, etc.), Department, Graduate Program, City, State, and Country.  Link all affiliations with their respective authors using a superscript number  in parentheses immediately after the author's name and in front of the  institutional address. Present a short and concise description of the individual  contribution of each author to conception and design of the study, the  contribution should be linked to the authors&rsquo; names using superscript letters  in parentheses. The author contributions will be published in the final  manuscript. Acknowledgements to individuals who provided help during the  research (e.g., providing language help, writing assistance, or proof reading  the article, etc.) and to public or private organizations/institutions which provided  financial or logistical support to conduct the study.</p>
   <p><strong>Main document</strong><br>
     The main document must contain  title, highlights, abstract, introduction, material and methods, results,  discussion, conclusions, and references. </p>
   <p><strong><em>Title:</em></strong> Concise and  informative, with no more than 20 words. Avoid symbols, abbreviations, and formulae. Please consider that  titles are often used in information-retrieval systems. </p>
   <p><strong><em>Highlights:</em></strong> Provide 3-5 bullet points  that convey the manuscript&rsquo;s core findings. Each bullet point must have a  maximum of 85 characters, including spaces.</p>
   <p><strong><em>Abstract:</em></strong> The abstract must be  concise, factual, and informative, not exceeding 400 words. The abstract is an independent  section, often presented separately from the manuscript; therefore, it must  stand alone and supply the main information about the manuscript. The abstract  must start with a brief sentence that clearly introduces the problem  and the manuscript relevance. The objective should be explicitly stated. It  must present relevant information about material and methods, the principal  results and major conclusions. References, symbols, and non-standard or  uncommon abbreviations should be avoided. If essential symbol or abbreviations be  used, they must be defined at their first mention in the abstract itself.</p>
   <p><strong><em>Keywords:</em></strong> Select up to five  relevant keywords, which must differ from those words used in the manuscript  title. Prepositions and conjunctions (of, or, and) must be  avoided. Do not use terms composed of more than three words. Only abbreviations  firmly established may be eligible.</p>
   <p><strong><em>Introduction:</em></strong> The  introduction must be clear and concise, but sufficient to present the addressed  problem and show any existing gap in knowledge. Bibliographic citations should  be specific, selected from the most relevant and recent studies, preferably  from journals with high impact factors. Thesis, dissertation, newsletters,  congress proceedings, and documents of difficult access should be avoided. The  hypothesis should be mentioned explicitly. A hypothesis is a statement (therefore,  written in the present tense) that establishes a cause-effect relation and which  should be supported or denied with experimenting; it will be used to construct  the conclusions. State the objectives at the end of the introduction. </p>
   <p><strong><em>Materials and methods:</em></strong> This section  can be subdivided by short headings referring to methods/procedures adopted; the  information should be organized in a logical order to enable full understanding.  Material and methods should provide sufficient details to allow the work to be  reproduced by an independent researcher. Field studies should contain the  location with geographic coordinates, climatic conditions, and soil  classification. Manuscripts describing research carried out in Brazil must have  the soils classified according to Brazilian Soil Classification System (SiBCS,  edition 2018) and, additionally, to present (parenthetically) equivalent  classification consistent with international systems (Soil Taxonomy or WRB). To  classify the soils according to the international systems, the authors should  access the Table of Partial Equivalence provided in this website or at J appendix  of the SiBCS. Manuscripts from foreign authors, whose soils were completely  analyzed and classified based on WRB or Soil Taxonomy, are not required to use  the SiBCS. Methods that are well known and already published should be indicated  by a reference, and only relevant modifications should be described. Reagents  and equipment model and brand should be cited only if this information is  essential to reproduce the study. The experimental design and the statistical  methods used to analyze the data should be described clearly. Software used in the statistical analysis should be  informed only if relevant.</p>
   <p><strong><em>Results:</em></strong> Results must  be clear and concise. They should be presented using tables or, preferably, figures  containing graphics, images, or schematic models. Avoid using more than four  tables and four figures. Avoid reproducing numeric values that have already  been presented in tables and figures. Tables and figures should be presented  along the text as &ldquo;table 1&rdquo; or &ldquo;figure 2&rdquo;, using a lowercase letter; or  highlighted in parenthesis (Table 1 or Figure 2). </p>
   <p><strong><em>Discussion:</em></strong> In this  section, the authors should present the significance of the results obtained, without  repeating them. Arguments that support the acceptance or rejection of the  research hypothesis should be explored. The discussion should support the  conclusions. Avoid excessive citations, such as those used to point out basic  concepts or common knowledge.</p>
   <p><strong><em>Conclusions:</em></strong> Conclusions  should be coherent with the hypothesis and objectives. Conclusions should be a  short, clear, and concise text, without further discussions, and results should  not be repeated here. This section must stand by itself, without requiring going  back to the results and discussion sections. Do not use bulleted or numbered  list to organize the conclusions. </p>
   <p><strong><em>References:</em></strong> Every reference cited along the text should be included  in the Reference list (and vice versa). Personal communication is not recommended  in the reference list. The Reference list should be organized first  alphabetically and then further sorted chronologically if necessary; more than  one reference from the same author(s) in the same year must be identified by  letters (&lsquo;a&rsquo;, &lsquo;b&rsquo;, &lsquo;c&rsquo;, etc.), placed after the publication year. Do not  translate the references; they should be presented in their original language. It  is not necessary to use a specific reference style at submission, as long as  the style is consistent. The reference style adopted by the journal (Vancouver  style adapted) will be mandatory only to the accepted manuscripts. The  formatting requirements are shown below.</p>
   <p><em><u>Citation in  text</u></em><br>
     Citations may be made directly  (or parenthetically). Examples: Ferguson (2016) or (Ferguson, 2016). <br>
     Manuscripts with two authors should be cited  as: Author 1 and Author 2 (Year) or (Author 1 and Author 2, Year). Examples: Silva  and Smith (1975) or (Silva and Smith, 1975). <br>
     Manuscripts with three or more authors  should be cited as first author&rsquo;s last name followed by &ldquo;et al.&rdquo; and the year  of publication. Example: Roberts et al. (2015) or (Roberts et al.,  2015). <br>
     Groups of references should be  listed first chronologically, then alphabetically. Examples: (Tanaka and Yano,  2005; Jackson et al., 2008).<br>
     References from the same  author(s) in the same year must be identified by letters &lsquo;a&rsquo;, &lsquo;b&rsquo;, &lsquo;c&rsquo;, etc.,  placed after the publication year. Examples: Silva (1975a,b) or (Silva,  1975a,b). <br>
     Personal communication should be used only if  absolutely necessary. In this case, the citation should be made informing the communicator&rsquo;s  name followed by the year, both in parentheses. Personal communication should  not be included in the Reference section, but it should be linked to a numbered  footnote, with the communicator&rsquo;s name, the date when the information was  collected, and the state and country of her/his institutional address.</p>

   <p><strong><em>Tables:</em></strong> Please submit tables as  editable text and not as images. Tables should not be  included in the main document and they should have portrait (not landscape)  orientation. They should be numbered sequentially with Arabic numbers. Each  table should be self-explanatory, containing the elements that allow readers to  understand the table's content without having to go back to the text. The  descriptive title above it should be brief, but with enough information to  describe the variables and their cause-effect relationships. Supplementary  information should be placed in footnotes. The footnotes should be indicated by  superscript numbers in parentheses (or asterisks for significance values and  other statistical data) and included beneath the table&rsquo;s body. Horizontal lines  should only be used in header lines, to highlight variables, and in the last  line of the table. Units should be placed in the body of the  table, on the first line above the numerical values (results). Vertical and  horizontal lines should not appear in the body of the table. Tables should be  created using a table tool of the text editing software, preferably from MS  Word or MS Excel. Avoid tables which have only a few rows and columns, try  stating the findings in a few sentences. Information in small tables can often  be presented better in the text. Do not insert blank columns or rows. Asterisks  or letters next to values indicating statistical significance should appear in  the same cell as the value, not an adjacent cell (i.e., they should not have  their own column). Revisions, such as adjustments of tables, may be requested  after manuscript acceptance.</p>
   <p><strong><em>Figures:</em></strong> Figures encompass two- or  three-dimensional graphs, images, and schematic models. Do not include figures  in the main manuscript file. Figures should have portrait (not landscape)  orientation and be numbered sequentially with Arabic numbers. The title should  appear below the figure and should be brief but sufficiently detailed to stand  on its own. Notes below the figure can be used to present additional  information. For multipart figures, each part should be labeled (a), (b), (c),&#8943;, sequentially. And each part should be described in the caption. Avoid  using figures with more than four sub-figures, and it is not allowed to insert  graphs as an image. For review (submission), figures may be submitted in EPS,  TIFF, and PDF formats (JPG and GIF formats are acceptable). However, editable  figures must be provided after manuscript acceptance. Photographs should be in <em>tagged image</em> (TIF) format with 500 dpi. Be  sure that the overall style in the figures follows the journal standards. For  example, if you use Mg ha-1 in the text, do not use Mg/ha in the  figures. Minor revisions in the figures may be requested after manuscript  acceptance.</p>
   <p><strong><em>Formulae and equations:</em></strong> They should be inserted as  editable text and not as image. Formulae and equations should be created using  the equation editor available in text editing software such as MS Word or any  other tool which allow to edit them. Equations should be cited along the  text as &ldquo;equation 1&rdquo;, using a lowercase letter; or highlighted in parenthesis  (Equation 1). Equations should be numbered consecutively as Eq.1, Eq. 2, Eq. 3, etc.  at the right-hand side.</p>
   <strong><em>Supplementary  File</em></strong><em>:</em> The  supplementary material allows presenting a more concise and clearer manuscript.  Supplementary material encompasses tables, figures, schematic models,  photographs, and datasheet, which are additional or complementary to support  the scientific paper. Each supplementary material should contain a concise and descriptive  caption. The supplementary material should not be cited in the main manuscript  text. Supplementary material will be published as received from the author,  without any conversion, editing, or reformatting; therefore, it should be  clearly and succinctly presented, and its formatting style should conform with  that adopted for the whole paper. The link to the supplementary material, if  any, will be inserted after the Reference section</td>

   <p>This journal uses double-blind review, which  means the identities of the authors are concealed from the reviewers, and vice  versa. After concluding the corrections required by editors and reviewers, the  author should submit a revision.</p>
To  do so, the author should access the Author Centre (at ScholarOne) and click on  Create a Revision. In step one, it is mandatory to prepare a text with general  and specifics answers to ALL questions raised and suggestions made by the  reviewers and editorial board, indicating in which lines changes were done;  this text should be inserted in a text box named &ldquo;your response&rdquo;. In the  following steps, the author will be required to upload the revised version of  the manuscript (main document). In this step, the author must provide a main  document file with ALL changes (removals and additions) made in the revision  process. The corrections must be highlighted (using a different color, or any  other tool, like bold for example) in the main document.</td>
