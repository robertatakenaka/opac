    <td width="70%">Papers sent for publication at <b>Revista Brasileira de Cirurgia 
      Pl&aacute;stica</b> must report studies on plastic surgery and related areas. 
      The journal publishes the following categories of manuscripts: editorials, 
      original articles, review articles, case reports, ideas and innovations, 
      reviews, letter to the editor and special articles. <br>
      Articles with mere advertisement or commercial purposes are not accepted. 
      <br>
      Authors are responsible for the content and information included in the 
      manuscripts. 
      <p><b>Peer-review:</b> Prior to publication, all articles submitted to <b>Revista 
        Brasileira de Cirurgia Pl&aacute;stica</b> go through a review and arbitration 
        process to guarantee quality standards and exemption in the selection 
        of the studies to be published. Initially, the paper is checked for publication 
        norms and completion. All manuscripts are submitted to peer-review by 
        at least three selected reviewers among members of the Editorial Board. 
        Acceptance is based on originality, significance and scientific contribution. 
        Reviewers fill out a form where they provide a careful assessment of all 
        of the items that are part of the manuscript. In the end, they make overall 
        comments on the study and will give their opinion as to the publication 
        and correction according to the recommendations. With this data in hand, 
        the editor makes a final decision. In case of discrepancies among reviewers, 
        a new opinion may be requested for better judgment. When suggestions for 
        changes are made by reviewers, they are forwarded to the main author and 
        a new version is sent back to reviewers to check whether suggestions/requirements 
        have been accomplished. In exceptional cases, whenever required according 
        to the theme of the manuscript, the Editor may request the collaboration 
        of a professional who is not a member of the Editorial Board to make an 
        assessment. This whole process is carried out through the submission system 
        and online management of the publication (Submission and Management of 
        the Publication - SGP). The evaluation system is double-blinded to guarantee 
        anonymity throughout the evaluation process. Decision on the acceptance 
        of the study for publication will be made, whenever possible, within three 
        months of the date of receipt. Receipt dates and dates of the approval 
        of the article for publication are informed in the published manuscript 
        to respect the priority interests of the authors. </p>
      <p><br>

        that the research has been approved by the Institutional Research &amp; 
        Ethics Committee (send a signed declaration that the research has been 
        approved), according to Helsinki's Declaration revised in 2000 [World 
        Medical Association (<a href="http://www.wma.net/e/policy/b3.htm" target="_blank">www.wma.net/e/policy/b3.htm</a>)]

        Experimentation (WHO Chronicle 1985; 39(2):51-6) and the precepts of the 
        Brazilian College of Animal Experimentation - COBEA (<a href="http://www.cobea.org.br">www.cobea.org.br</a>). 
        The Editorial Board of the Journal may decline articles which do not strictly 
        comply with research ethics precepts in both humans and animals. The authors 
        must accurately identify all of the drugs and chemical substances used, 
        including the names of the active principle, dosages and administration

        policies for the registration of clinical essays and the International 
        Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), and in recognition of the 
        importance of these initiatives for international registry and dissemination 
        of information on clinical Access, as of July 2010 will only accept clinical 
        research articles which have received an identification number in one
