    <TD width="70%"><strong>1. Articles  submission</strong>
<p>Texts should be  sent only by Scielo&rsquo;s online system (<a href="http://www.scielo.br/rs">http://www.scielo.br/rs</a>), in Word open  format (<em>.doc</em> or <em>.docx</em>) or anther compatible format. The text can have a maximum of  10.000 (ten thousand) words, including notes and bibliography, which should  come at the end of the text. Notes must contain complementary and substantive  information, not just bibliography information. The bibliographical references  formats are presented below. The front page must contain: title and abstract  (between 80 to 120 words). It is very important remark that the main version of  the manuscript which must be attached at Scielo&rsquo;s system, can not contain any  kind of reference or information that reveal the identity of the author&rsquo;s  article.</p>
      <p>The manuscripts  will be first evaluated by Editorial Board, aiming to check minimum standards  of academic quality and if the manuscript conforms to the scope of the Journal.</p>
      <p>Then, the  manuscripts will be read by two peer reviewers, which evaluation will base the  Editorial board&rsquo;s decision, notifying it to the author(s). The double-blind  review evaluation process is assured. In case of positive decision, the  author(s) must send to <em>Religi&atilde;o &amp; Sociedade</em> the article&rsquo;s final version with the  changes defined by the Editorial Board, based on the expert&rsquo;s opinions  previously issued. </p>
      <p>The final  version must contain: (a) an abstract, in Portuguese and in English (between 80  e 120 words); (b) a list with until 5 key-words, in Portuguese and English  expressing the most important ideas of the text, referring to usual topics in academic studies; (c)  author(s)&rsquo; information (academic degrees, last publications, institutional  bonds, complete address, e-mail); (d) an English version of the title. Any  increasing or modifications will not be accepted after the papers were  submitted for composition.</p>
      <p><strong>Bibliographical references format</strong></p>
      <p>Bibliographical  references must be located in the body text and end notes in the format (Author  Year) or (Author Year:Page), for example (Mauss 1960:32). If there is more than  one tittle of the same author in the same year, they&rsquo;ll be differentiated by a  letter after the year, like the following example (Mauss 1960a; Mauss 1960b).<br>
      Bibliography,  at the end of the paper, must be in the following format:</p>
      <p>Book: LAST  NAME, First name. (year), <em>Title of the  book</em>. Place of publication: Publishing house, edition number if not the  first.<br>
        WEBER, Max.  (1965), <em>The Sociology of Religion</em>.  Boston: Beacon Press, 2º ed.</p>
      <p>Paper: LAST  NAME, First name. (year), &ldquo;Title of the paper&rdquo;. <em>Title of the Journal</em>, edition number: pages.<br>
        LATOUR, Eliane. (1996), &ldquo;Os tempos de  poder&rdquo;. <em>Cadernos de Antropologia e Imagem</em>,  nº 3: 35-52.</p>
      <p>Collection:  LAST NAME, First name. (year), &ldquo;Title of the chapter&rdquo;. In: initials of the  first name followed by organizers&rsquo; last name. <em>Title of collection</em>. Place of publication: Publishing house,  edition number if not the first.<br>
        BELLAH, Robert.  (1979), &ldquo;New Religious Consciousness and the Crisis in Modernity&rdquo;. In: P.  Rabinow (ed.). <em>Interpretative Social  Science: a Reader.</em> Berkeley: University of California Press.</p>
      <p>Dissertations  and thesis: LAST NAME, First name. (year), <em>Title  of thesis or dissertation</em>. Place:  academic degree, institution.<br>
        GUIMAR&Atilde;ES, Patr&iacute;cia. (1997), <em>Ritos do Reino de Deus: pentecostalismo e  inven&ccedil;&atilde;o ritual</em>. Rio de Janeiro: Disserta&ccedil;&atilde;o de Mestrado em Antropologia  Social, UERJ.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Bibliographic  reviews submition </strong></p>
<p>Bibliographical reviews published  in Religi&atilde;o &amp; Sociedade intend to present to their readers recently  published books (in the last 2 years) about religion theme on its various  possibilities of connections with society, with reflections resulting from  cutting-edge research from the field of humanities and social sciences <br>
        Bibliographic reviews received  will be evaluated by the Editorial Review and Editorial Board. The reviews will  be accepted if they could be capable to: 1) explain the general thesis of the  work; 2) determine its relevance within the field of social sciences in its  relation with religion; 3) summarize the main arguments of the chapters; 4) to  consider the potentialities and limits of the analyzes presented in the book.<br>
        Bibliographic reviews could bring  critical reflections about interpretation of facts, adopted methods or  theoretical choices proposed. To preserve textual clarity, it is recommended to  gather the critical comments in a specific part after the abstract itself.  Reviews containing allusive (unsubstantiated) criticism and personal attacks  will be disregarded <br>
        The Editorial Review may request  specific opinion if it is considered necessary. In the same way, it could also  ask for reviews of works recognized as important to social sciences debate in  religious interface, in Brazil and abroad. <br>
        By the criteria exposed above,  the evaluation could have three results: &ldquo;review approved&rdquo;, &ldquo;review approved  with modifications&rdquo; and &ldquo;review refused&rdquo; (with no resubmission). The last two  results will be communicated with a short opinion. <br>
      Outras obras citadas na resenha devem ter suas refer&ecirc;ncias completas  apresentadas em nota ao final do texto. The review must have at most 1.500 words. The author(s) must give a  title to the review. The review&rsquo;s bibliographic reference should appear at the  beginning of the text, observing the following format: LAST NAME, First name. <em>Title of the work</em>. Place of publication:  Publishing house, year, edition number if not the first, number of pages. For  example GEERTZ, Clifford. <em>A Interpreta&ccedil;&atilde;o das Culturas</em>. Rio de Janeiro:  Guanabara Koogan, 1989, 325pp. Other works  mentioned in the review should have their complete references presented in a  note at the end of the text.</p>
