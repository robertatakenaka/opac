      <p><b>Types of articles accepted:</b></p>
      <p>The <i>Brazilian Journal of Psychiatry</i> publishes the following types of manuscripts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Original articles</u> &ndash;<b>&nbsp;</b>Reports  of original studies based on scientific excellence in psychiatry and providing  advances in clinical and experimental research. Original articles must contain  new data derived from a representative number of participants and employ sound  and adequate methods. Articles must not exceed 4,000 words.</li>
        <li><u>Brief Communications</u> &ndash;&nbsp;Short&nbsp;reports of original studies, evaluations, or  pilot data, containing no more than 2,000 words and 15 references.</li>
        <li><u>Reviews</u> &ndash;&nbsp;Concise  and objective systematic articles designed to bring together updated and  relevant information about a specific topic of particular importance and  interest in psychiatry and mental health. Authors are required analyze and  discuss the available literature. It should contain a maximum of 6,000 words.<u> </u></li>
        <li><u>Letters to the Editor</u>&ndash;&nbsp;Communications  discussing articles recently published in the journal or describing original  researches or meaningful scientific discoveries. Letters should have no more  than 500 words and five references. </li>
        <li><u>Editorials</u> &ndash;&nbsp;Critical comments and made  by researchers with expertise in a specific area of knowledge at the editors&rsquo;  invitation. They must contain a maximum of 900 words and five references.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Originality  and authorship</b></p>
      <p>        The <i>Brazilian Journal of Psychiatry</i> only considers for publication manuscripts consisting of original material that  are not currently under consideration for publication or were not published elsewhere. The only exceptions are abstracts with less than 400  words. Authors must identify tables, figures, and/or any other material published published elsewhere, and obtain permission from the copyright owners before reproducing or modifying the materials. In submitting a manuscript, the  editors understand that the authors comply with this requirement, and that all  of them have substantially participated in the work and have personally  reviewed and given final approval of the version submitted. Therefore, each  author is required to declare his or her individual contribution to the article  in the cover letter (see below) and in the manuscript, in a section after the  &ldquo;Conclusions&rdquo; entitled &ldquo;Individual contributions&rdquo;.</p>
      <p><b>Conflicts  of interest and financial disclosures</b></p>
      <p>The <i>Brazilian  Journal of Psychiatry</i> demands that all authors individually report any  potential conflicts of interest and/or any kind of financial support for the  study obtained within the last three  years and for the foreseeable future. This  disclosure includes, but is not limited to, stock options/ownership, grants,  stipends, employments, affiliations, royalties, inventions, relationship with  sponsoring organizations (governmental, nonprofit, and/or commercial sources), lectures  and speakers bureau for any pharmaceutical company, patents (filed, received,  pending, or in preparation), travel funds; regardless of value or amount. If one  or more authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose, they must explicitly  state it (eg, Drs. Leme Lopes and Nobre de Mello have no conflicts of  interest to report). Interested authors can read an editorial about this  subject, entitled &quot;Beyond conflict of interest&quot;, in the British  Medical Journal available at: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/317/7154/281" target="_blank">http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/317/7154/281</a>.</p>
      <p>        The conflicts of interest and financial disclosures must be written as a  discrete section entitled &quot;Conflicts of Interest&quot;, after the  &quot;Individual contributions&quot; section.</p>
      <p><b>Ethical  issues</b></p>
      <p>        The <i>Brazilian Journal of Psychiatry</i> considers ethical integrity a cornerstone for scientific research and care of  human beings. Therefore, in the section entitled &quot;Methods&quot;, authors  are required to identify the licensing and the institutional review board or  committee that reviewed and approved the research. Also, in cases of studies  involving human subjects, authors must clearly state that all participants  agreed and signed the informed consent form, and must describe the methods used  to evaluate the capacity of subject to understand and give informed consent,  and strategies used in the study to ensure the protection of human subjects.  Finally, in cases of studies involving animals, authors must declare that  institutional and national guidelines for the care and use of laboratory  animals were strictly followed.</p>
      <p><b>Clinical  Trial Registration</b></p>
      <p>        Before submitting a  manuscript for a potential publication in the&nbsp;<em>Brazilian Journal of  Psychiatry</em>, authors must register the clinical trials in a public trials  registry. A clinical  trial is herein defined as any research that prospectively enrolls human  subjects or groups to one or more interventions (pharmacological or not) to  estimate its impacts on health outcomes. Authors should  register these trials before or at the onset of subjects' enrollment.  To be considered valid, a public trial  registry must be freely accessible to the public, must be electronically  searchable, opened to all prospective registrants and managed by a non-profit  organization. Some examples are the National Institutes of Health Clinical  Trials (<a href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov" target="_blank">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</a>), the Netherlands Trial Register (<a href="http://www.trialregister.nl" target="_blank">http://www.trialregister.nl</a>), the UMIN Clinical Trials  Registry (<a href="http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr">http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr</a>), and the  Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (<a href="http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/">http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br</a>),  among others. The trial name and  its URL, the public trial registry name and its URL, as well as the registration  number, must be included immediately after the conflicts of interest disclosure.</p>
      <p><b>Overall  Structure of the Manuscript</b></p>
      <p>Authors should avoid  abbreviations. However, official ones  may be used, keeping in  mind that the first mention of a term in the text must be complete, followed by  its abbreviation between brackets. Authors  must use generic names of medications, as opposed to its trade names.</p>
      <p>        The manuscript must  have all pages numbered, with total words count indicated at the first  page (except for abstracts, both in Portuguese and in English, references,  pictures and illustrations).</p>
      <p>        The first page should contain the Title and the Running Head (both in English  and in Portuguese), as well as the manuscript&rsquo;s total word count, and the authors' names and affiliations. Article titles should not contain acronyms. The Running Head  should contain a total of up to 50 characters (with spaces) and no more than  five words. Different from the Title, the Running Head must also appear at the  top of each page of the manuscript (in the same language that it  was written).</p>
      <p>        The second page  must contain an abstract in Portuguese and the trial registration information  (when applicable, see above). The abstract must be informative, clearly and  concisely describing the manuscripts' content in no more than 250 words. In  original articles, brief communications and reviews, abstracts have to be  structured in four topics: objective(s), methods, results and conclusions. A  maximum of five key words in Portuguese should follow the abstract. They  should, if possible, be drawn from the MeSH list of Index Medicus and be chosen  with a view to useful cross-indexing of the article. For articles written in Portuguese,  these terms are available at <i>Descritores de Ci&ecirc;ncias da Sa&uacute;de</i>, published  by BIREME.</p>
      <p>        The third page  must contain the abstract and keywords in English both of which must be  identical to their versions in Portuguese.</p>
      <p>        The fourth page should contain the entire or the beginning of the  Introduction section. In original articles, brief reports, and reviews, the correct sequence  of the sections is Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusions,  Individual Contributions, Conflicts of Interest, Acknowledgments and  References.  Although the <em>Brazilian Journal of  Psychiatry</em>&nbsp;does not stipulate a maximum number of pages,  authors must always respect the maximum number of words and references allowed  to each kind of article accepted. Tables and figures should come after the  references, be cited in the text, and their desired position in the manuscript  should be indicated.</p>
      <p><u>Introduction </u>&ndash; Must contain a concise review of any literature  directly related to the topic, as well as the aim of the study.</p>
      <p><u>Methods</u> &ndash; Must depict the model of study and a detailed  description of the methods employed, in order to permit its replication by  other authors.</p>
      <p><u>Results</u> &ndash; Described logically, sequentially and  concisely, with the occasional help of tables and illustrations.</p>
      <p><u>Discussion</u> &ndash; The discussion must be limited to highlighting  the conclusions of the study, consider any similarities or differences with the  results of other authors, implications of the findings, limitations and future  perspectives.</p>
      <p><u>Conclusions</u> &ndash; Authors must specify, preferentially in a short  paragraph, solely the conclusions the study data allow to support, together  with their clinical significance (avoiding excessive generalizations).</p>
      <p><u>Individual contributions</u> &ndash; Manuscript must include the specific  contributions made by each author in this section. To be an author,  each collaborator must meet at least all the following conditions: (1) had  substantially contributed to conception and design or analysis and  interpretation of data; (2) had substantially contributed to drafting the  article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and (3)  had given the final approval of the version to be published.</p>
      <p><u>Conflicts of interest</u> - Each author must disclose any potential conflict  of interest that might have the potential to have biased the study (whether financial  or not). If one or more author has no conflict of interest to declare, this  must be explicitly stated (see Section Conflicts of Interest and Financial  Disclosures)</p>
      <p><u>Acknowledgments</u> - In this section, authors must recognize personal  and technical assistance, as well as provide detailed information regarding all  sources of grants and other modalities of material or financial support.</p>
      <p><u>References</u> - Must be presented in Vancouver style (&quot;Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals:  Writing and Editing for Medical Publication&quot;  [<a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html" target="_blank">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html</a>]) in the same order they  were quoted in the text, as shown in the following examples.</p>

      <p>In order to reduce the time  between manuscript submission and the editors' final decision and eventual  publication, the&nbsp;<em>Brazilian Journal of Psychiatry&nbsp;</em>has  implemented a ScholarOne internet-based submission  and tracking system (<a href="https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/jbpsiq-scielo">https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/jbpsiq-scielo</a>). Therefore, the Journal no longer accepts  submissions through e-mails. Authors must  submit all manuscripts, with no exceptions, through ScholarOne system. During  the submission process the authors must provide a Title and a Running Head (no  more than five words), indicate a corresponding author and an ORCID (<a href="https://orcid.org/signin">https://orcid.org/signin</a>), include a concise abstract, add a cover  letter and a permission letter, suggest five potential reviewers and also proceed according to ScholarOne submission  process steps.  Attention: <u>the suggested reviewers cannot work at the same  institution/department, cannot have  close relationships, or have published as a co-author with any of the authors</u>.  The lack of attention to these requirements  can lead to rejection.
    <p>There is no fee for submission and review articles.</td>

    <td width="70%"><p>In the cover letter,  authors must provide the complete name and affiliations of all authors and the  contact information for the corresponding author (postal and e-mail addresses,  telephone and fax numbers, etc.). Authors  should also explain why they consider the submitted article suitable for  publication in the Brazilian Journal of Psychiatry, highlighting its relevance  and innovative aspects. In addition, authors are required to clearly state that  the manuscript represents original material, that has not been published  previously, and that is not being considered for publication elsewhere.

General  supervision of the research group alone does not justify authorship.  Participation solely in the acquisition of funding or the collection of data is  also not sufficient. In order to assure that all these conditions will be met, authors are required to include a  statement in the cover letter regarding  authorship, separately describing the role of each author in the study and  manuscript preparation, otherwise the  paper will not be reviewed.</td>

    <td width="70%"><p><b>Peer Review</b>
      <p>        After receiving a  manuscript through the ScholarOne, editors  will judge if the anonymous reviewers will  review it. They will base their decision  on the publishing scope of the journal, and on the structure, originality, and  relevance of the manuscript to the field, and structure. Then, if the editors  decide so, they will submit the manuscript to  at least two anonymous and independent reviewers (not necessarily those  suggested by the authors). The Editors of the Brazilian Journal of Psychiatry  strive to keep a rapid publication timeline. Generally, the process from  manuscript submission to acceptance takes about three months. Authors will  receive by e-mail the editors' final decision, along with copies of the  reviewer’s comments. In case of reviews, authors must return the final text  with necessary changes (responding each item raised by the reviewers),  according to the editors' instructions.&nbsp;<u>Authors must reproduce the  reviewer’s comments before their answers.</u>&nbsp;Including just the answers  to the reviewer’s comments is not enough and can lead to delays in processing.  All this process can be tracked by authors through ScholarOne.      
      <p><b>Permission letter</b>
      <p>Authors are required to fill a permission  letter and submit it along with the manuscript:</p>
      <p>&quot;The undersigned authors hereby approves submission of  this work and all subsequent for publication and transfer, assign, or otherwise  convey all copyright ownership to the Brazilian Journal of Psychiatry.&nbsp; Also, the undersigned authors warrant that  this work represents original material and does not infringe upon the copyright  of any third party; that no part of the work has been published or will be  submitted for publication elsewhere unless and until it is rejected by Brazilian  Journal of Psychiatry. Finally, the authors agree to indemnify the Publisher  against any loss or damages arising out of a breach of this agreement. In the  event that our submission is not published, copyright ownership shall revert to  the Author(s).&quot;</p>
      All authors need to sign the permission letter and include their complete name, addresses  for postage, phone, and e-mail. They ought to  scan and submit it for the Editors through the ScholarOne System.</td>
