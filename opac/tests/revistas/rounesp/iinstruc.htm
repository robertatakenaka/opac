  <td width="15%"></td>
  <td width="70%"><p>The periodical is intended to publish original  scientific articles of basic and applied research, dissemination, and  literature review that comprise advances in scientific knowledge in Odontology,  respecting quality indicators.</p>
    <p>The  ROU is an open access journal that uses the Creative Commons Attribution (CCBY)  in published articles. This license allows the published articles be re-used  without permission for any purpose once the author and original source are  cited.</p>
    <p>-  Articles sent for publication must be original and not being submitted  simultaneously to other journals. This journal reserves all copyright of published  works, including translations, allowing, however, their subsequent reproduction  and transcription with proper citation of the source. </p>
    <p>-  Papers may be published in Portuguese or English. <br>
      Texts  in English shall be accompanied by document attesting their revision by  professionals with proficiency in the English language.</p>
    <p>-  This periodical is issued bimonthly. It reserves the right to submit all papers  to a board of referees that is fully authorized to decide for their acceptance,  or to return them to the authors with suggestions and alterations in the text,  and/or for adaptation to the journal&rsquo;s editorial regulations. </p>
    <p>-  The concepts stated in the works published are of full responsibility of the  authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinion of the Scientific Editor or  Editorial Board.</p>
    - Receipt and acceptance dates shall be  published in the articles.
    <p><b><i>Analysis  Criteria of Articles</i></b></p>
    <p>-  Articles will first be evaluated concerning compliance with the Periodical&rsquo;s  norms and analyzed by plagiarism detection softwares. The journal considers unacceptable the  practice of plagiarism. When plagiarism is detected authors are informed, with  the presentation of the report generated by the software used. The ROU uses Turnitin plagiarism  detection software. The article will be immediately refused.</p>
    <p>- Articles in compliance to publication norms will be evaluated by  the Area Editor who will forward them to the Scientific Editor. The Scientific  Editor will then evaluate articles regarding scope and attendance to minimum  criteria of scientific quality and writing. Shall works be inadequate or in  disagreement with this periodical's norms, they may be rejected based on the  assessment of the Area Editor, or be sent to peer rating. </p>
    <p>- Articles in compliance with the norms will be submitted to  merit and scientific method assessment by at least two referees (Peer Rating  Process) from institutions other than that of their authors, and by the  Scientific Editor as well. The identity of authors' institutions will be kept  in complete secrecy. </p>
    <p>- If revision is needed, articles will be returned to their  respective authors for alterations. The revised version of an article shall be  resubmitted accompanied by a cover letter explaining each and every alteration  requested by the referees. The suggestions that were not accepted shall be  validly justified. Alterations must be clearly highlighted. Concerning  suggestions and corrections made directly in the text, it is recommended that  modifications be made in <i>Word</i> configurations in order to keep authors' identities in secrecy. The revised  article and cover letter are initially evaluated by the Scientific Editor, who  will forward them to the referees when requested.</p>
    <p>- In case of inadequacies in language, Portuguese or English, a  technical revision made by an expert will be requested to the authors.</p>
    <p>- In case of article rejection by one of the two referees, the  Scientific Editor shall decide whether to send it for the assessment of a third  referee.</p>
    <p>- If there are doubts about the statistical analysis, it will be  referred to the journal's statistical consultant.</p>
    <p>- After approval regarding the scientific merit, articles will  be submitted to a final analysis - only in Portuguese (technical revision) - by  a professional of the area.</p>
    <p><b><i>Proofreading of Articles</i></b></p>
    <p>- The articles will be sent to their  authors for proofreading by e-mail, with a link to the download of the  diagramed version in <i>PDF</i> file, for  final approval.</p>
    <p>- Authors will be allowed 72 hours  for correction and return of the original article properly revised, if  necessary.</p>
    <p>- If the proofreading version is not  returned in 72 hours, the Scientific Editor will consider it without  alterations, and no further changes will be allowed. Only small modifications,  such as spelling corrections and illustration verifications, will be accepted.  Extensive alterations will imply on its reevaluation by the referees and,  consequently, its publication delay.</p>
    <p>- The inclusion of new authors is not permitted  in this phase of the publication process.</p>
    <p>- The journal has strict  attention to the ethical standards for conducting research in animals and  humans. Certificates of ethics committees in animals and humans are required at  the submission process. In case of doubt on the documentation submitted, the journal  may refuse the article.</p></td>
