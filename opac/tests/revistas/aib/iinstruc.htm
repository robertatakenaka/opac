      <p><strong>Arquivos do  Instituto Biol&oacute;gico</strong> aims to publish in Portuguese, English or  Spanish original high quality scientific articles, which contribute  significantly to the development of the Agricultural Sciences, in the field of  animal and vegetal sanity, related to agribusiness and its implication in the  agri-environment, including quality and food safety. It is also accepted papers  on urban pests.<strong></strong><br>
The journal supports and follows the  principles and standards recommended by COPE (Committee on Publication Ethics),  an international organization reference on integrity and ethics in scientific  publishing. Thus, the entire process, selection criteria and journal publication  follow the conduct rules and ethics in accordance with <a href="http://publicationethics.org/files/u2/New_Code.pdf">http://publicationethics.org/files/u2/New_Code.pdf</a>.</p>

        In addition, a  statement signed by the corresponding author on behalf of all authors, must be  attached as a supplementary document in the designated area in the online  system where the authors state that:<br>
        a)  the data contained in the manuscript is original and authentic, so there is no  fraud and/or plagiarism derivations (all received manuscripts are subjected to  a software to detect plagiarism); b) the manuscript was not submitted for  publication in any other printed or electronic vehicle; c) the manuscript  content is authors' responsibility, who assume they have contributed  significantly to research and must provide retractions or correct mistakes if  necessary. In case of doubt, see the <a href="http://www.singaporestatement.org/statement.html">Singapore  Statement</a>;  d) in case of conflicts of interest, they will be manifesting, which will  subsequently be examined by the Editorial Committee.</p>

The Scientific Consultant also fills an evaluation form. The  acceptance of the article is in agreement with the Editor-in-chief of the  Editorial Comittee. In case the article is rejected by part of the Scientific  Consultants, the Associate-Editor will issue his conclusive technical opinion.  The reviews and the conclusive technical opinion will be forwarded to the  authors for corrections, justifications and presentation of the new version of  the draft, which is compared to the original version by the Editor-in-chief of  the Editor Comittee. Once it is accepted, the article is forwarded to  reference, abstract and vernacular review. After the layout change, the text is  submitted to final corrections by the authors and by the Editorial Comittee.  All articles are published following the approval order.</p>
