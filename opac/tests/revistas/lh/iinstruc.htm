    <p><strong><em>SCOPE AND MISSION</em></strong></p>
      <p>Letras de Hoje is a quarterly publication of the Graduate Program in Letters of the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul and its mission is the dissemination of unpublished works related to the areas of Linguistics, Theory of Literature, Literature and Portuguese Language, aiming at the diffusion of knowledge in these areas.</p><br>
       <p><strong><em>SECTIONS</em></strong></p><p>
 The thematic section is organized by one or more researchers, experts in the topic of the call. For this section, unpublished articles pertinent to the proposed theme are accepted. The proposed theme is announced on the website of the Journal, including the names of the organizers, the theme, the synopsis of the number and the deadline for submitting the originals. In each issue of the Journal, 10 to 15 articles are published in this section. Researchers and/or teachers linked to institutions of higher education and national or international research can submit papers for the thematic section.<p>
The free section works in a continuous stream, being open for submission of unpublished works: articles, reviews and literary texts (short stories and poems). In each issue of the Journal, three texts are published in the free section. Master teachers and doctors attached to a higher-level institution may submit papers for this section. PhD students, linked to a postgraduate course, may also submit. When co-authoring, contributions involving at least one author with doctor's degree are encouraged.</p><br>
<p><strong><em>PROCESS OF PEER-REVIEW</em></strong></p><p>
The peer-reaview of papers submitted for publication in Letras de Hoje occurs in two instances. In the first one, the work is analyzed by the organizers of the issue number and by the editors of the Journal, who make a preliminary evaluation of the pertinence of the content of the works in relation to the proposed theme and editorial policy of the Journal, as well as the adequacy of the essay to the proposed genre and standards of publication. At this step, the work can be rejected or sent to peer referees.<p>
In the second instance, the work, without identification of authorship, is submitted to the evaluation of two reviewers, members of the Editorial Board or ad hoc reviewers. Only the works approved by the two reviewers are published, if the modifications requested, when they exist, are fulfilled by the author. If there is a divergence between the two opinions, a third reviewer is requested.<p>
The originals are sent to the reviewers without identification of the authors. However, when reading the manuscript, it may happen that the reviewer recognizes the institution or authors. In this case, the reviewers are asked to check if there is no conflict of interest and if it is possible to evaluate the article impartially. The identities of the reviewers are never revealed to the authors.<p>
The reviewer is offered an evaluation form, where the opinions and suggestions must be written down, which are reviewed by the editors before being sent to the authors.</p><br>
<p><strong><em>OPEN ACCESS</em></strong></p>
<p>This journal provides open access to all of its content, following the principle that free access to scientific research generates a greater global exchange of knowledge. Such access is associated with increased reading and citation of an author's work. More information on this approach can be found in the Public Knowledge Project: <a href="https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/">https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/</a></p><br>
<p><strong><em>ARTICLE PROCESSING CHARGES POLICY</em></strong></p>
<p>This journal does not charge fees for article processing (APCs).</p><br>
<p><strong><em>ARCHIVING</em></strong></p>
<p>This journal utilizes the LOCKSS system to create a distributed file system among participating libraries and allows them to create permanent archives of the journal for the preservation and restoration.</p></td>
