  <p>RBSO publishes new original articles with scientific relevance in the field of Occupational Safety &amp; Health (OSH). The journal adopts a multidisciplinary approach and brings several aspects of OSH in the different economic sectors of the formal and informal world of work including: the work and health relationship between; conceptual aspects and analyses of occupational accidents; risk analyses; risk management and OSH management systems; epidemiology; etiology of occupational illnesses; exposure to chemicals and toxicology; relationship between workers' health and environment; OSH education and training; behavior at work and its physiological, psychological and social dimensions; mental health and work; muscle-skeletal disorders, psychological conditions and their relationship to organizational aspects and production restructuring; OSH professions and professional practice; health services organization and occupational safety at public and private companies; labor regulation and laws; workplace inspection; social, organizational, and political aspects of OSH.</p>
  <p>Authors are entirely responsible for the opinions they express in the articles.</p>
  <p>RBSO does not charge submission or article processing charges (APC). This is an open access journal which, according to the definition of BOAI (<a href="http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/" target="_blank">Budapest Open Access Initiative</a>), means that &ldquo;its free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Publication of articles resulting from research involving human beings must follow ethical principles (<a href="http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/b3/">Declaration of Helsinki</a> - adopted in 1964 and amended in 1975, 1983, 1989, 1996, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2008 and 2013) and comply with the specific legislation of the country where it was carried out. In Brazil authors must inform about the research protocol approval by the Research Ethics Committee. The information should be included in the manuscript. </p>
  <p>RBSO endorses both policies for registration of clinical trials: the World Health Organization &ndash; WHO (<a href="http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/">http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/</a>), and the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors - ICMJE (<a href="http://www.wame.org/about/policy-statements#Trial">http://www.wame.org/about/policy-statements#Trial</a>) as well as (<a href="http://www.icmje.org/about-icmje/faqs/clinical-trials-registration/"> http://www.icmje.org/about-icmje/faqs/clinical-trials-registration/</a>), and recognizes the relevance of these initiatives for international registering and international dissemination of information on clinical trials through open access. Therefore, RBSO only publishes articles on clinical trials that have previously obtained an identification number in one of the Clinical Trials Registration Offices certified by WHO and ICMJE standards . Addresses of Registration Offices are available through ICMJE website : <a href="http://www.icmje.org/about-icmje/faqs/clinical-trials-registration/">http://www.icmje.org/about-icmje/faqs/clinical-trials-registration/</a> . Identification number must be indicated underneath the abstract.</p>
  <p><strong>Research support and funding</strong></p>
  <p>Authors must reveal all sources of support and funding received by the study presented in the submitted manuscript.</p>
  <p><strong>Conflicts of interests</strong></p>
  <p>Authors, reviewers, and editors must disclose any potential conflicts of interest concerning the elaboration or assessment of a submitted manuscript, no matter how unlikely they are. Conflicts may involve financial/commercial, academic, political, or personal interests.</p>
<p>Reviewers must also inform the journal editorial board whether there is any conflict of interest that may influence their opinion or analysis, and state specifically when their participation as a reviewer of a manuscript is inadequate or inappropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Plagiarism policy</strong></p>
<p>
  To  identify plagiarism, submitted manuscripts will be analyzed regarding their  originality and novelty through the tool CrossRef Similarity Check.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific integrity policy</strong></p>
<p> As  reference for scientific integrity policy RBSO adopts the international  standards attested by the Committee on Publication Ethics&nbsp;&ndash; COPE (<a href="http://publicationethics.org/">http://publicationethics.org/</a>) for  editors&rsquo; and authors&rsquo; ethical research publication</p>
<p>    <strong>The manuscripts  assessment process</strong></p>
Manuscripts, submitted  accordingly to the instructions to authors and RBSO editorial policy, are  checked by the Executive Editorial Board in regard to the following: their  adequacy to the journal scope, their originality and their layout following the  essential aspects of a paper presentation. If considered adequate, the  manuscripts will be assessed by the Scientific Editor who considers the merit  of the contribution. At this stage, manuscripts involving statistics are  forwarded to two statistics consultants who will give their independent  opinions. If they meet the necessary scientific criteria, an Associated Editor  is appointed and will indicate at least two peer reviewers known for their  expertise on the theme of the manuscript. In case it is considered unsuitable  for publication it will be refused.
<p>Both parts (author/reviewer) involved in the assessment process will be kept unnamed.</p>
<p>The Scientific Editor's decision is based on both the reviewers' analysis and the associated editors' assessments. If necessary, authors are asked to make alterations in their manuscripts, which are essential for publication acceptance. At this point, not responding in a timely manner may lead to manuscript rejection.</p>
<p>Non-acceptance of a manuscript can happen at any time on the Scientific Editor's criteria. When this happens, authors will receive a written document explaining the reasons for their manuscript refusal.</p>
<p>The journal office is free from any obligation to send back the rejected manuscript originals to authors.</p>
<p><strong>Responsibility and copyright</strong></p>
<p>Articles accepted for publication become property of the journal.</p>
<p> Approved paper authors must post a signed document of Responsibility and Copyright Transfer Agreement , available through the link</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fundacentro.gov.br/arquivos/rbso/DRCD/2016_ENG_DRCD.docx">http://www.fundacentro.gov.br/arquivos/rbso/DRCD/2016_ENG_DRCD.docx</a></p>
<p>It may be signed either by all authors in a sole  document, or by each author separately. For a quicker procedure the signed  agreements can be scanned and sent by e-mail. Nevertheless, the documents with  the original signatures must be sent by post to the following address:</p>
