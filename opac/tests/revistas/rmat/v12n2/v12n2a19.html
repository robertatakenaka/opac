<p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The main objective 
  of this study was to evaluate the influence of mechanical surface treatments 
  for excess glass removal on the fracture toughness of a glass infiltrated zirconia 
  toughened alumina "GI-ZTA" disks (In-Ceram<sup>®</sup> Zirconia). 
  The GI-ZTA disks were submitted to three different mechanical surface treatments 
  after glass infiltration (grinding, sandblasting and grinding/sandblasting/annealing). 
  Fracture toughness was evaluated through indentation fracture (IF) test. Reliability 
  of tests results was accessed through Weibull statistics. Results: Indentation 
  fracture tests (IF) of GI-ZTA disks have shown that grinding was the surface 
  treatment that presented the lowest K<sub>Ic</sub> and reliability. An annealing 
  treatment after grinding and sandblasting promoted an increase in K<sub>Ic</sub>, 
  mainly due to monoclinic-tetragonal reverse transformation recovering the tetragonal 
  zirconia lost during the different mechanical surface treatments. The highest 
  K<sub>Ic</sub> values were observed after sandblasting and grinding/sandblasting/annealing. 
  Significance:&nbsp; The proposed mechanical surface treatments played an important 
  role on the metastability of tetragonal zirconia and strongly influenced the 
  mechanical performance of GI-ZTA. Kruskhall-Wallis test indicated that K<sub>Ic</sub> 
  values of the three mechanical surface treatments were statistically distinct.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The loss or destruction 
  of teeth due to periodontal disease, caries or trauma, have lead dentistry and 
  engineering professionals to develop new materials and search for prosthetic 
  treatments for the replacement of those missing teeth. </font> </p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Until recently, 
  all ceramic restorations were indicated only for single crowns and partial coverage 
  restorations due to their low flexural strength and fracture toughness. Although 
  the relationship between mechanical properties and their clinical performance 
  are influenced by many factors, some of those properties have been used as initial 
  parameters to determine the clinical potential and limitations of these materials 
  &#91;1&#93;. </font> </p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The In-Ceram<sup>®</sup> 
  Zirconia (Vita Zahnfabrik) is composed of <font face="Symbol">a</font>-alumina 
  with&nbsp; 33wt% partially stabilized zirconia partially sintered in two steps 
  at low temperatures (1120 and 1180<sup>0</sup>C) to avoid shrinkage followed 
  by glass infiltration at 1140<sup>0</sup>C, resulting in a dense and high strength 
  ceramic core, mainly used for replacing posterior teeth with all-ceramic restorations. 
  </font> </p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a straight 
  relationship between strength and fracture toughness in brittle materials, where 
  the critical crack size to initiate failure is determined by the inherent flaw 
  population introduced during material processing and component manufacture &#91;2-5&#93;. 
  </font> </p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The toughening 
  mechanism of zirconia ceramics by mechanical surface treatment is based upon 
  the development of a compressive surface layer induced by tetragonal-monoclinic 
  transformation; compressive stresses and microcracks hindering crack propagation 
  &#91;6-11&#93;.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The strengthening 
  of zirconia toughened ceramics depends on the amount of transformed zirconia 
  on the deepest region of the compressive surface layer, which increases with 
  the intensity of grinding. Otherwise, severe grinding may cause cracks that 
  could extend beyond the compressive surface layer; in that case, the mechanical 
  properties would decrease drastically &#91;3, 4, 12&#93;.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sandblasting has 
  the ability to promote microcrack nucleation and a compressive state at the 
  surface with no increase in temperature. MOON et al. &#91;13&#93; reported that 
  sandblasting were able to introduce dislocations as well as great density of 
  micro cracks. GUAZZATO et al. &#91;11&#93; and KOSMAC et al. &#91;4&#93; indicate 
  that sandblasting flaws have&nbsp; the nature of true microcracks. They observed 
  an extended surface damage produced by sandblasting, which were only partially 
  compensated by the tetragonal-monoclinic transformation. </font> </p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is known that 
  in zirconia based ceramics, the toughening mechanism is mainly achieved by the 
  tetragonal-monoclinic transformation.&nbsp; An annealing treatment may be capable 
  of recovering some tetragonal phase lost after grinding and sandblasting. It 
  is also possible that other mechanisms, such as microcracking, crack bridging, 
  crack deflection, and second-phase particles&nbsp; may contribute to an increase 
  in&nbsp;&nbsp; toughening.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mechanical tests 
  in ceramic materials are difficult to compare. Biaxial flexure tests tend to 
  produce higher values than three-point flexural tests mainly due to the tensile 
  stress concentration on the edges of the three-point test samples and the relative 
  volume under tensile stress &#91;14, 15&#93;. These results, some of them being 
  conflicting, emphasizes the need of knowing the type of test used in the experiment.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The aim of this 
  work was to investigate which type of surface treatments for molten glass removal 
  in a commercial GI-ZTA would result in minor loss of transformable tetragonal 
  zirconia and better mechanical performance.&nbsp; Fracture toughness by indentation 
  fracture (IF) of glass infiltrated ZTA disks was evaluated after three different 
  mechanical surface treatments named grinding, sandblasting and grinding followed 
  by sandblasting and annealing.</font></p>

  AND METHODS</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thirty six ZTA 
  disks (In-Ceram<sup>®</sup>Zirconia) disks (diameter = 25mm and width = 2.5mm) 
  were molded by slip casting&nbsp; followed by partially sintered at 1180<sup>0</sup>C. 
  After partial sintering the ZTA disks were glass infiltrated at 1140<sup>0</sup>C 
  for 2 hours. After those treatments, the infiltrated ZTA disk, called GI-ZTA, 
  was submitted to different mechanical surface treatments for excess glass removal: 
  Grinding (group 1), sandblasting (group 2) and grinding followed by sandblasting 
  and annealing (1000<sup>0</sup>C) (group 3). In grinding, the infiltrated sample 
  were submitted to a cylindrical diamond bur at 20,000rpm without cooling until 
  complete glass removal . In sandblasting, the sample was positioned&nbsp; at 
  an angle of 45<sup>0</sup> and 2.0cm far from the sandblaster (alumina particles 
  50<font face="Symbol">m</font>m and constant pressure 3bar). <a href="/img/revistas/rmat/v12n2/a19fig01.jpg">Figures 
  1</a> and <a href="/img/revistas/rmat/v12n2/a19fig02.jpg">2</a> show, respectively, the technique 
  for&nbsp; excess glass&nbsp; removal&nbsp; by grinding and sandblasting.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Young modulus of&nbsp; 
  GI-ZTA disk (254.9 GPa) was determined from an ultrasound non-destructive test 
  and Vickers hardness (9.8 GPa) according to ASTM C1327-99.&nbsp; Fracture toughness 
  (IF) was determined according to the equation (1) proposed by ANSTIS et al. 
  &#91;16&#93;, where P = load (N), c = crack length measured from the center 
  of the Vickers indentation (mm), H= hardness (GPa), E= Young modulus (GPa) and 
  0.016 = Numeric factor. In order to determine crack length, samples were mirror 
  polished&nbsp; with diamond paste.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ten Vickers indentations 
  (59 and 98 N) were made on each sample. An oil drop was placed on the surface 
  of each disc just before the indentation in order to prevent moisture on the 
  crack tip.&nbsp; The criteria of indentation acceptance&nbsp; were: presence 
  of only four radial cracks with crack length&nbsp; no less than 2.5 times the 
  length of the indentation half diagonal; cracks coming from the corners of the 
  indentation;&nbsp; symmetry of the indentation; absence of chipping and absence 
  of pores along indentation perimeter. <a href="/img/revistas/rmat/v12n2/a19fig03.jpg">Figure 3</a>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Statistical analysis

  toughness, in a similar manner as the Weibull analysis for flexural strength 
  data. This analysis was conducted to evaluate the reliability of the infiltrated 
  ZTA disk submitted to the different mechanical surface treatments.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>4&nbsp;DISCUSSION</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many studies concerning 
  the effect of grinding on advanced ceramics had been carried out and still are 
  being made &#91;4, 6, 8-11, 19, 20&#93;. It seems to be an agreement that the 
  influence of grinding on microstructure and mechanical properties of zirconia 
  based ceramics depend on many factors, such as: type and amount of stabilizer, 
  processing steps, type of abrasive and degree of grinding (speed, pressure and 
  cooling), as well as the nature and size of the surface compressive layer introduced 
  by the grinding process. </font> </p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">GARCIA et al &#91;9&#93; 
  reported that the influence of grinding on the toughening mechanism of zirconia 
  based ceramics could be achieved by&nbsp; transformation toughening&nbsp; and 
  microcracking, in which particles that were hit by the abrasive would tend to 
  generate microcracks around themselves, deflecting&nbsp; cracks and in consequence 
  increasing toughness. LUTHARDT et al &#91;20&#93;, however, observed that deep 
  cracks in Y-TZP introduced by grinding through CAD/CAM process far exceeded 
  the compressive surface layer, damaging the microstructure and decreasing its 
  mechanical properties.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the other hand, 
  sandblasting seems to be a mild surface treatment. GUAZZATO et al. &#91;21&#93; 
  reported that a rough and damaged surface could be observed after sandblasting, 
  but those defects were fairly smaller than from grinding. KOSMAC et al. &#91;4&#93; 
  observed that after sandblasting, the thickness of the monoclinic surface layer 
  was found to be larger than in grinded samples, indicating that not only stresses 
  but also the locally developed temperatures being lower during sandblasting, 
  would led to an increase in strength and in Weibull modulus. &nbsp;This behavior 
  was not observed by GUAZZATO et al. &#91;21&#93;. They argued that the surface 
  damage and the high stresses developed by the abrasive particles were only partially 
  counteracted by the tetragonal-monoclinic transformation, resulting in strength 
  degradation and lower Weibull modulus. In the present work, GI-ZTA disks after 
  sandblasting, presented a higher fracture toughness and&nbsp;&nbsp; highest 
  reliability. Quantitative X-ray diffraction of GI-ZTA disks after the different 
  mechanical surface treatments&nbsp; shown in <a href="/img/revistas/rmat/v12n2/a19tab03.gif">Table 
  3</a>, agrees with the previous results reported by KOSMAC et al. &#91;4&#93; 
  and GUAZZATO et al. &#91;21&#93;.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Based on these 
  facts, caution should be taken when considering the effect of sandblasting on 
  zirconia based ceramics due to differences in size of the abrasive particles 
  and pressure employed. Under low pressure, only the zirconia particles from 
  the surface undergoes the tetragonal-monoclinic transformation, causing the 
  flaws and defects to be very small and not exceeding the thickness of the compressive 
  surface layer. Otherwise, higher pressure would tend to produce larger flaws 
  that could exceed the thickness of the compressive surface layer, decreasing 
  its mechanical strength and not affecting the amount of monoclinic zirconia 
  at the surface.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The mechanical 
  strength of any brittle material is determined by two main factors: resistance 
  to crack propagation (fracture toughness) and flaw size. Based on these observations, 
  the results of fracture toughness (<a href="/img/revistas/rmat/v12n2/a19tab01.gif">Table I</a>) 
  indicated that group 1 (grinding) presented the lower fracture toughness due 
  to the high flaw density introduced by grinding. Sandblasting (group 2) presented 
  a significantly higher toughness compared to group 1, mainly due to the shallower 
  and more uniform cracks in comparison to grinding. Group 3 (grinding followed 
  by sandblasting and annealing promoted an effective tetragonal-monoclinic reverse 
  transformation mainly due to the annealing treatment. Annealing may have possibly 
  caused crack tip healing by the glass phase. </font> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>5&nbsp;CONCLUSIONS</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- The mechanical 
  surface treatments for excess glass removal played an important role on the 
  stability of tetragonal zirconia, affecting the fracture toughness of ZTA.&nbsp; 
  Although grinding did not affect significantly the relative amount of tetragonal 
  zirconia, it introduced defects which decreased its fracture toughness; </font> 
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Sandblasting 
  produced the smallest dispersion on K<sub>Ic</sub>, although it did not present 
  the highest K<sub>Ic</sub>; this observation indicated that sandblasting introduced 
  uniformly distributed shallow cracks which led to a higher reliability. The 
  toughening mechanism&nbsp;&nbsp; could be explained by the great amount of monoclinic 
  phase introduced by sandblasting; </font> </p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">- Grinding followed 
  by sandblasting and annealing presented the highest KIc. In this case, annealing 
  recovered some tetragonal zirconia lost during both surface treatments.</font></p>
