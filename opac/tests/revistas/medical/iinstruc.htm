    <p>
      <strong>I.  ORIGINAL RESEARCH</strong> </p>
    <p>
        <strong>MedicalExpress&nbsp;</strong>accepts  manuscripts in the<strong>&nbsp;ORIGINAL  RESEARCH&nbsp;</strong>class on themes of direct or indirect interest to  the furtherance of knowledge in the field of medicine. An<strong>&nbsp;ORIGINAL RESEARCH&nbsp;</strong>manuscript  must fully describe a project in which a gap in biomedical knowledge is  contemplated and clarified. This definition includes confirmatory repeats of  hitherto controversial reports, as well negative results that are not obvious  to experts. Articles describing&nbsp;<strong>Clinical  Trials, Human Research and Animal Model Research&nbsp;</strong>are  subject to the following restrictions:<br>
        <strong>Clinical Trials</strong>&nbsp;are  only acceptable if duly registered before the start of data collection  with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/" target="_blank">www.clinicaltrials.gov</a>&nbsp;or  equivalent international repository of such trials.<br>
        <strong>Human research</strong>&nbsp;projects  must conform to the Helsinki Declaration<br>
        (<a href="http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/b3/" target="_blank">http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/b3/</a>)<br>
  <strong>Research on animal  models</strong>&nbsp;must conform to the ethical rules applying to such  procedures as specified by the Basel Declaration (<a href="http://www.basel-declaration.org/" target="_blank">www.basel-declaration.org</a>)</p>
    <p>Manuscript should be divided into the following parts </p>
    <ol start="1" type="1">
      <li>Full Title and Running Title</li>
      <li>Authors and Affiliations</li>
      <li>Abstract.</li>
      <li>Keywords Insert 3 - 5 keywords.</li>
      <li>Introduction</li>
      <li>Materials and Methods</li>
      <li>Results</li>
      <li>Discussion</li>
      <li>Conclusions</li>
      <li>Acknowledgements</li>
    <li>References</li></ol>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Full title</strong><br>
    (maximum 250 characters, including spaces, no  abbreviations): This is the first thing the reader will see. If it does not  clearly state something interesting the reader will prefer to read another  article. This should be as short as possible. Ideally use a single affirmative  sentence informative of result, not of method. Make it understandable to  readers outside your field of expertise. If  possible, avoid punctuation marks.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Example:</li>
    </ul>
&ldquo;The Sympathetic Nervous System Potentiates the Fight  or Flight Reaction in Dogs.&rdquo;<br>
<em>is better than</em><br>
&ldquo;The Role of the Sympathetic Nervous System on the Fight or Flight Reaction: a  Canine Model.&rdquo;
<ul>
  <li><strong>Running title</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>(maximum 50 characters): indicate the topic of your  article.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Authors and Affiliation</strong></li>

<ul type="disc">
  <li>Names of Authors: Given Name, Family Name (do not abbreviate).       Middle names may be spelt in full or abbreviated.</li>
  <li>Professional Address of all authors: Department, Institution, City       State or Province), Country</li>
  <li>Use superscripted Roman Numerals (I,II,III) to indicate different       addresses of each author.</li>
  <li>Who qualifies as author? Authors are all persons who had a significant       part in planning, executing and writing an article. All others, very       especially persons who only read the manuscript, or only provided       financial or technical support should be recognized in the       acknowledgements</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Abstract</strong> (maximum 250 words) <strong>and Keywords</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is the second thing your reader will see  (if he does not like it, he will not read your paper). Keep it short and  attractive.<br>
  Structure the abstract into:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Background information: only insert this if absolutely necessary</li>
  <li>Objective: Short affirmative sentences.</li>
  <li>Method: Absolute minimum to allow reader to understand how you got       the results</li>
  <li>Results. Clearly state what you found. Avoid inserting means &plusmn; std,       or p&lt;, p&gt;. State       what is/what is not significant and relevant.</li>
  <li>Conclusion: : ideally, one sentence from the summary of the main       text: the take home message.</li>
  <li>Discussion. Do not insert a discussion</li>
  <li>Abbreviations: only weights and measures, mathematical, physical,       chemical symbols.</li>
  <li>No References. If Article describes a Clinical Trial, insert name       and number of the respective registry.</li>

  <li>Explain what each figure and Table shows. For example:</li>
  <li>&ldquo;Figure 1 shows that &ldquo;STIMULUS&rdquo; induces a significant increase in       &ldquo;EFFECT A&rdquo;, a transient increase in &ldquo;EFFECT B&rdquo;, but no action on &ldquo;EFFECT       C&rdquo;.</li>
  <li>Describe any findings not shown in Figures or Tables.</li>
  <li>Do not arrive at conclusions</li>

  <li>Never paste a figure to a word.doc or word.docx file.</li>
  <li>At the end of the manuscript (after the reference list) insert a       section named &ldquo;Legends for illustrations&rdquo;. Start each legend by identifying       the figure (Figure 1, Figure 2, etc) Describe each figure as synthetically       as possible but with enough information for the figure to be       understandable without resource to the main text. If there are any       abbreviations, or formulae in the Figure, add a footnote defining all such       abbreviations or formulae.</li>

  <strong>References</strong>.  As described above for original research.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>IV.  EDITORIALS</strong> <br>
  Editorials  should be composed as brief texts on topically important issues, No research  results should be described.<br>
  No abstract, method or result section should be included.<br>
  References should be kept to a minimum, usually less than 6, unless exceptional  circumstances dictate otherwise.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>V.  READER&rsquo;S OPINIONS</strong> <br>
