        a) <strong>research article</strong> - text  ranging from 5,000 words (minimum) up to 9,000 words, containing the report of  one empirical research; <p>
        b) <strong>essay</strong> - text ranging from  5,000 (minimum) up to 9,000 words, containing the discussion of a theoretical  issue relevant to the field to which it belongs; <p>

  <em>Word counting in all cases above  includes the references and appendixes.</em> <p>
  <strong>Special issues or thematic dossiers</strong><p>
  <em>Linguagem em (Dis)curso</em> can launch a call for papers on  specific themes, or invite researchers to organize special issues or thematic  dossiers. These special issues or dossiers can also result from spontaneous  proposals submitted by renowned scholars in the field of the publication. Submissions  must be formally presented by the author(s) by means of a specific form, to be  sent after manifestation of interest. Once approved, the organizers will  prepare a chronogram to follow and supervise the process. Articles included in  the special issues must go through the same external evaluation process as  those submitted to the journal's regular issues, and must follow the journal's  editorial guidelines. <p>
  <strong>Peer-reviewed evaluation</strong><p>
        The texts received go through a  two-phase evaluation process. <p>
        In the first,&nbsp;carried  out&nbsp;by the editors, aspects related to the  suitability of manuscripts to the editorial norms. In this stage,&nbsp;the  text&nbsp;can be disqualified if: <p>
        a) it does not comply with the ABNT  stylesheet or with the journal guidelines; <p>
        b) it amounts to a review of  literature with no critical stance; <p>
        c) the&nbsp;text is inadequate (not  in accordance with the genres accepted by the journal; presenting cohesion  problems; etc.); and <p>
        d) the text presents formatting  problems (indentation done through the space bar, blank lines between  paragraphs and references, colored graphs and figures which do not allow  appropriate visualization. <p>
        In the second stage, the texts  selected by the editors are sent to two anonymous readers who  evaluate&nbsp;them in terms of&nbsp;form and content. Two negative opinions  result in the text being disqualified. In case&nbsp;of differing  opinions,&nbsp;the text is then sent to a third reader.<p>
  <strong>General criteria for text evaluation</strong><p>
        a) contribution for knowledge in the  field;<p>
        b) theme setting;<p>
        c) methodology regarding to the  genre;<p>
        d) theoretical consciousness;<p>
        e) Theoretical adequacy and analysis/discussion;<p>
        f) answer to the aims and  questions/matters;<p>
        g) linguistic formulation;<p>
        h) coherence in the relation title/abstract/text;<p>
        i) current and relevance references.<p>
  <strong>Final Revision</strong><p>
        If the work is accepted for  publication, the editors reserve themselves the right  to make the necessary formatting adaptations and little changes. Articles approved with restrictions will be sent to  the authors to be reviewed. In such cases, <em>the Editors reserve themselves  the right to refuse the article if the changes do not meet the reviewers'  suggestions</em>. In a last analysis, texts acceptation is decided by editors,  depending on elements which evaluators did not have access because of the  double blind evaluation. <p>
        The author must be informed of the  arrival of his/her contribution within eight days, and of the results of the  assessment within 6 (six) months after the first notice. In those cases in  which the 6 (six) months period is not enough for the assessment process, the  author(s) will be informed that their work is still under evaluation. It is an  authors’ right request information on the situation of their work, in case of  information delay. <p>
        The text reviewed should present all  the identification data. <p>
        Once submitted the work, the authors  should not require its removal until finish the pending, except by excessive  delay on information about the result and if the evaluation are not occurring.<p>
        The editors should be consulted if  there is interest on re-publication (as a chapter) or translating to publish  overseas – in this case, the original source has to be explicit. </p>
The issues of <em>Linguagem em (Dis)curso</em> are published before express authorization  by the writers, over who are all the respective legal responsibilities  regarding to the information served. A <strong>Statement of responsibility </strong>should  be filled and signed by the author(s) when the text submission (V. Submission  conditions). </td>
