  <p align="left"><strong><em>Revista Brasileira de Ci&ecirc;ncias Sociais</em></strong>(Rev. Bras, Ci. Soc.) is one of the leading interdisciplinary journals in the field of the social sciences in Brazil. Its mission is to publish cutting edge knowledge production of the three great areas forming both the scope of the <em>Associação Nacional de Pós-Graduação e Pesquisa em Ci&ecirc;ncias Sociais</em> (ANPOCS) and the very tradition of the social sciences: Anthropology, Political Science, and Sociology. The Journal encompasses the characteristically broad thematic diversity of those areas, as well as their corresponding plurality in terms of methodology and theoretical and conceptual development. When clearly engaged with social sciences' debates, articles from other areas will occasionally be accepted. The <em>Revista</em> mainly publishes inedited articles. Keynote address delivered at the ANPOCS Annual Meetings are published as well. The Journal regularly publishes book reviews in order to contribute to the circulation of relevant national and international knowledge for social sciences.</p>
  <p align="left"><em>Revista Brasileira de Ci&ecirc;ncias Sociais</em> publishes inedited articles – not previously published in books, magazines or journals – with explicit substantive empirical and theoretical contributions to their fields. Review essays are published only when specifically commissioned by the Editorial Board (ANPOCS publishes BIB, a bibliographical review journal). Book review articles, on the other hand, are published by the <em>Revista</em> and must be inedited and cover books concerned with the three mentioned areas and their subareas. Specifics about articles' layout are can be consulted in the &ldquo;Guidelines for the authors&rdquo;. The Journal accepts of articles and reviews submissions in Portuguese, Spanish, and English, which will be published in the original language. The <em>Revista</em> publish keynote address given at t ANPOCS Annual Meeting aiming at making available to wider publics the speeches of outstanding international scholars, often financed with public founding. The <em>Revista</em> does not publish dossier in regular issues, neither translations of non inedited articles.</p>

  <td width="70%">
   <p>The publication of articles is subjected exclusively  to criteria of merit. The process of merit evaluation is the same for all  articles – including those which could occasionally be ordered by the Editorial  Commission. After their submission, the articles undergo a process of desk  review in order to assess their adequacy to the Journal’s purpose and editorial  policy. Not later than 30 days from the moment of the submission, the authors  will be informed of the results of this first phase. The approved articles will  be subjected to a double blind peer review. There are four possible results  from this second phase: approval for publication without modifications;  approval for publication conditioned to modifications; recommendation of  revision, and re-submission; and refusal. The third result does not imply that  the Journal would necessarily publish the article in the event of a  re-submission. The Journal will not accept re-submission if the two peer  reviewers suggest “revision and resubmission” or if one of them refuses the  article and his/her opinion is considered adequate by the editorial commission.  The average time for the second phase is of five months. The opinions related  to the articles submitted in English of Spanish will be formulated in one of  those idioms, according to the preferences of the community of the Journal’s  peer reviewers. The review expenses of approved English or Spanish written  articles should be covered by the authors. <em>RBCS</em> do not charge fees for publishing.</p>
   <p> Articles having received both a favorable evaluation  and a recommendation for revision and re-submission shall be sent to the  Journal within three months after the reception of those opinions of by the  author(s). Once elapsed this period, such articles will be removed from the  agenda of the Editorial Commission. Articles with approval for publication  conditioned to modifications shall be revised and re-submitted within thirty  days. The Editorial Commission reserves the right to suggest new modifications  of form, or of punctual character in terms of content, in order to turn the  article adequate to the Journal’s editorial or graphical profile.</p>
   <p> The order of publication follows the criterion of a  single row with the exception of brief <em>ad  hoc</em> texts – as tributes or honors, for instance – and bibliographic  accounts occasionally ordered by the Editorial Commission. </p>
   <p><strong>Reciprocity  </strong> <br>
Articles submission and evaluation by double blind peer review system implies the commitment of the author(s) to address as satisfactorily as possible to the observations and criticisms of the reviewers. The Journal appreciates reviewers' work and, accordingly, will not submit to peer evaluation texts having received negative reviews in other journals if their authors have not made the effort address reviewers' observations. By the same token, the Journal reserves the right to decline articles whose revision disregards the suggestions of the reviewers without reasonable justification.</p>
<p>
 The authors who submit articles to the Journal commit themselves to provide blind peer reviews when occasionally invited to do so by the Journal. The Editorial Board reserves the right of not submitting to the second phase of evaluation (double blind peer reviews) articles whose authors repeatedly decline the delivery of reviews when invited by the Journal.</p>

<p><strong>Book Reviews</strong><br>
 Book reviews are accepted for evaluation when referred to works published no more than 24 months before the moment of their submission to the Journal. All book reviews are subject to the evaluation by the Book Reviews Editor and the Editorial Board. Such evaluation is guided by three criteria: adequacy to Journal's editorial policy and profile; relevance of the book reviewed for social sciences in general, and according to the current debates in the three great areas of the social sciences in Brazil. The Editor of Book Reviews may ask for a specific expert evaluation if judged convenient. In some circumstances, as in the case of works admittedly important for the debate of the social sciences in the country, the Book Reviews' Editor may commission book reviews. There are three possible results of the evaluation guided by the above criteria. Book reviews may be &ldquo;accepted&rdquo;, &ldquo;accepted with modifications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;declined&rdquo; – book reviews resubmission is not admitted. In the cases of the two last results, evaluation brief reports will be delivered.</p>

<p><strong>Copyrights, exclusivity and CC-BY license</strong> <br>
 When submitting an article or a book review, the authors commit themselves to not send them to another journal during the process of evaluation. Conversely, the Revista does not receive articles yet under evaluation in other journals. It will not either proceed to two simultaneous evaluations of the same author, considering that this would amount to a simultaneous submission (submitting a new article while another one has not yet been published or declined).</p>
<p>The submission of any collaboration implies the integral cession of copyrights to ANPOCS, including those of translation, in the case of the article acceptance for publication. The authors are, of course, authorized to reproduce their articles provided that the original source (Rev. Bras. Ci. Soc.) and reference are mentioned.<br>
 In accordance with SCIELO, the Journal adopts the CC-BY license, internationally used by the open access leading journals and publications. It is understood that any author of an article published in the RBCS agrees with the use of such kind of license.</p>

<p><strong>Good scientific practices</strong> <br>
 In tune with the advancements in the field of ethics and the good scientific practices, all the articles approved in the first phase will be subjected to tests in order to avoid plagiarism and &ldquo;auto-plagiarism&rdquo; or republication (publication as inedited of articles already published). Occasional cases of bad practice will be assessed and decided by the Editorial Board according to<strong> </strong>the <em>Diretrizes Básicas para a Integridade na Atividade Cienífica</em> [Basic Guidelines for the Integrity of Scientific Activity] of the <em>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico – CNPq</em> (<a href="http://www.cnpq.br/web/guest/diretrizes">http://www.cnpq.br/web/guest/diretrizes</a>) and the <em>Código de Boas Práticas</em> [Good Practices Code] of the <em>Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo – FAPESP</em> (<a href="http://www.fapesp.br/boaspraticas/">http://www.fapesp.br/boaspraticas/</a>).</p>
