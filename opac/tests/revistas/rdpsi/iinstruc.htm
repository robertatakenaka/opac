        work, for the interaction among participants and for the final edition 
        of the text. The live debate, when not organized by the journal, can be

        contain the financing agency. The abstracts must present, in a clear way, 
        the objectives of the work, without references, including the most important 
        ideas of the specific literature in the subject. The material and methods 
        must be described, including subjects, equipment, techniques and other 
        strategies used. The description of the results must contain the synthesis 
        of what was obtained and, if that&acute;s the case, expose the measures 
        and the results of the statistic proofs applied. The conclusion must be

      <p><b>Abstracts of thesis, dissertation and academic works:</b> brief description 
        of mastership dissertation and doctorship or free-docency thesis (Maximum 
        1,5 pages) </p>
      <p><b>PEER REVIEW</b></p>
      <p>The submitted articles are primarily evaluated to verify if they are 
        written according to the standards of the Journal publication. If there 
        are any flaws in the standardization of the articles, the secretary of 
        the Journal will make contact with the authors asking for the necessary 
        corrections. Once this is made, the articles are sent to the evaluators 
        (blind review). They are doctored professors, of renamed knowledge in 
        psychology field, especially on the main subject of the article to be 
        evaluated. The evaluators are asked to emit their opinion by the Chief 
        Editor.</p>
      <p>Each article is evaluated for two estimators, who express their final 
        evaluation according to the following items:</p>
      <p>( ) Should be published, with priority. It is not necessary to be reviewed.<br>
        ( ) Should be published. It is not necessary to be reviewed.<br>
        ( ) Should be published, but needs to be reviewed.<br>
        ( ) Should not be published.</p>
      <p>In the case that both the evaluators mark one of the first two options, 
        the article is included on the list of approved works, ready for publication, 
        and the author receives a letter informing that his/her article was approved 
        for publication in the Journal. When one of the evaluators marks the third 
        option, the author receives letter from the Journal followed by the evaluation 
        on which are indicated the necessary corrections to publish the article. 
        The evaluations are given to the authors without the indication of the 
        name of the evaluators. Once the author obeys the requests presented in 
        the evaluation, the article is once again submitted to the evaluator so 
        he can verify if the changes made on the article are enough for its approval. 
        If both evaluators indicate that the article shouldn&acute;t be published, 
        the author receives a letter informing that the article was not accepted 
        for publication. When both evaluators emit conflictive evaluations, one 
        approving the article and other not approving its publication, a third 
        doctored professor is invited to give his opinion. In this case, the article 
        will be considered ready for publication when two of the three evaluators 
        considerate that the article must be published. In the same way, the article 
        will be considered non-indicated for publication when two of the three 
        evaluators considerate that the article should not be published in the 
        Journal.</p>
