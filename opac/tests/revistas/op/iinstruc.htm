      <P> Decisions regarding the publication of articles belong  to the journal's editors, by way of review by specialists. The evaluation may:  a) recommend an article&rsquo;s publication; b) recommend publication provided that  suggested revisions be made; or c) reject its publication.</P>
      <P> Positions and concepts emitted in signed articles are  the sole responsibility of their authors and do not express the opinion of the  Editorial Board.</P>

    <TD WIDTH="70%"><P>The papers (in .doc format) should be submitted using  the Scielo/ScholarOne online system:&nbsp;<a href="https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/op-scielo" target="_blank">https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/op-scielo</a>.

Articles considered for publication in <strong>Opini&atilde;o P&uacute;blica</strong> are  subject to double-blind review by specialists.</P>
      <P> OPINI&Atilde;O P&Uacute;BLICA publishes original articles written in  Portuguese, Spanish, and English. The articles can be submitted in French as  well; if approved, their publication will depend on the availability of  resources for translation. In order to guarantee an anonymous review process,  the author&acute;s name must not appear in either the text or in any other reference  that allows its identification. The article must be accompanied by a letter of  cession of the copyright to CESOP/UNICAMP, mentioning agreement with its  publication and providing the following information: name, complete address,  telephone/fax numbers, e-mail, academic titles, and institutional affiliation.</P>

Tables, maps, charts, graphs, etc.&nbsp;must be placed in the appropriate position in the text, in  .jpg&nbsp;(300 to 500 dpi)&nbsp;format, with title, caption, and source.

      <P> Authors cited must appear in the text and should be  referred to as follows: (Author&acute;s last name, date) or (Author&acute;s last name,  date, page number). E.g.: (Souza, 1976) or (Souza, 1976, p. 64). Different  titles by the same author published during the same year should be identified  by a letter after the date. E.g.: (Almeida, 1989a), (Almeida, 1989b).</P>
      <P> The bibliography that is used must be presented at the  end of the article, with authors listed in alphabetical order and in accordance  to the ABNT norms (NBR 6023), as illustrated in the following examples. Note not  only the order of the elements, but also to the kinds of sources and the  punctuation conventions used in each citation.</P>

      <P> - The  titles of the article&rsquo;s sections should be formatted in bold and its  subsections in italics.</P>
      <p>- The  sections and subsections of the article should not be numbered. If there are  quotes and/or references to sections of the article itself throughout the text,  refer to the section title. E.g.: As discussed in the section &quot;Opinions  and Attitudes about Democracy...&quot;.</p>
      <p> - Whenever  there is a reference to the article itself, the word &quot;article,&quot; and  not the words &quot;paper,&quot; &quot;work,&quot; &quot;study,&quot; etc.,  should be used in the text.      </p>
      <p> - The  titles and sources of the tables should be complete (when they are  &quot;self-produced,&quot; indicate the data on which they are based. E.g.:  Self-produced based on TSE data).</p>
      <p> - The  titles and sources must not be embedded in the charts and graphs.</p>
      <p> - Symbols  such as &quot;%&quot; and others should be removed from the inside of the  tables and graphs and, when applicable, presented together with their  respective titles.</p>
      <p> Ex.: Table  1<br>
        Title:  Frequency of variables indicative of &quot;steals, but gets things done&quot;  (%)<br>
        We ask that  attention be paid to the spelling of proper nouns and dates of publications  cited in the text and in the references to minimize dubiety.</p>
      <p> OPINI&Atilde;O  P&Uacute;BLICA's staff will review typographical errors, orthography, grammar,  spelling of proper nouns, acronyms, dates of publication in the bibliographical  references in the body of the text and in references at the end of the article;  however, the more careful authors are with all these aspects, the less likely  it is that errors will appear in the published version.</p>
