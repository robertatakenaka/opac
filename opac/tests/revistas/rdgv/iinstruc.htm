      <p>All articles undergo a prior assessment (desk  review) held by the Editor-in-chief, who verifies the attendance to the formal  submission requirements, its adequacy to the journal&rsquo;s editorial policy and its  potential for publication. </p>
      <p>In this initial phase, it is also performed a  similarity check through the anti-plagiarism iThenticate software.</p>
      <p>After this stage, the approved articles are sent to  anonymous reviewers for evaluation, according to the process known as double  blind peer review. Comments will then be forwarded to the author for  acknowledgment or incorporation of the suggested modifications. In the latter  case, the modified text must be sent to the journal to be reevaluated. </p>
      <p> Exceptionally, there will be invitations for  publication, which will be made exclusively by the editorial office. </p>
      <p>Reviews and translations will be evaluated and  selected by the editorial office. </p>
