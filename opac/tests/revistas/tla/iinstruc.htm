      <p><strong><em>Trabalhos em Lingu&iacute;stica Aplicada</em></strong><strong> </strong>(Papers  in Applied Linguistics)&nbsp;is a three-times-a-year publication  of the Graduate Program in Applied Linguistics of the Institute of Language  Studies at the State University of Campinas (Unicamp). Its aim is to  disseminate works that contribute with new perspectives to the field of Applied  Linguistics.</p>
      <p> The journal is interested  in publishing articles that reflect on language along different research  fields: Interculturality and Identities; Teaching and Learning of Native and  Foreign Languages; Technologies and social media; Translation; Multimodality  and Intermediality; Linguistic Anthropology; Language Policies; Discourses and  Politics.</p>
      <p>It is part of the Journal&rsquo;s editorial policy to receive  manuscripts written not only in Portuguese, but also in English, French or Spanish.  Two abstracts are required: one in the manuscript&rsquo;s original language  (Portuguese, English, French or Spanish), the other in English, as specified in  the &ldquo;publishing norms&rdquo;. For manuscripts written in English, the second abstract  should be in Portuguese. Each abstract must be followed by a list of three  keywords in the language of the abstract. Authors&nbsp;are entitled to receive  one print copy of the issue in which their article is published.<br>
        Before submitting a manuscript, author(s) must  be in agreement with the following main requirement of the Editorial Committee: <br>
        - The manuscript must be unpublished and  original.<br>
        - The manuscript shall not have been previously submitted to other  journal or collective volume.<br>
        - All authors who sign the manuscript must either be Masters or Doctoral  candidates or hold a Masters or Doctoral degree. <br>
        - The submitted file must be in accordance with the journal&rsquo;s  specifications.<br>
        - All authors of the manuscript should not have published another  article in the previous six issues of the journal.<br>
        - All the steps required by the online system must be fully completed;  all requested information must be filled in (including the biographic note,  with indication of academic titles and institutional affiliations).</p>
      <p>The journal does not publish chapters or stretches of completed theses  and/or dissertations.</p>
      <p>Supervisors or Sponsors  of Masters, Doctoral or Post-Doctoral research that is being submitted to the  journal should be referred to in the footnotes as supervising professors; they  ought not be listed as co-authors.</p>
      <p>Co-authored manuscripts  are accepted as long as the ethical compromise of effective authorial  participation of all signing authors is strictly maintained. Our policy is in accordance  with the following Brazilian research agencies&rsquo; recommendations:</p>
      <p> &ldquo;Only the people who effectively lent significant  contribution to the work deserve to be listed as authors of a manuscript. By  significant contribution this report means the making of experiments,  participation in the elaboration of experimental planning, analysis of results  or the elaboration of the manuscript draft. The lending of equipment,  acquisition of grants, or general supervision do not by themselves justify the  inclusion of new authors, who therefore must be the object of acknowledgement.  (<em>Report of the Commission of the CNPq  Research Integrity</em>, CNPq, 2011)</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&ldquo;In a scientific work, authorship  should include all and only researchers that have made direct and substantial  intellectual contributions to the design or execution of research and have  given their express permission to be included. Specifically, the provision of  financial and infrastructural resources (e.g., laboratories, equipment, inputs,  materials, human resources, institutional support) is not sufficient ground for  being listed among the authors of the scientific works resulting from the  research project.&rdquo; (<em>Code of Good  Scientific Practice</em>, Fapesp, 2014)</p>
      <p> The Journal also publishes translations with  commentary of currentarticles,  interviewsand  reviews of recent and relevant work in the field. Besides presenting the work  to the reader, reviews must discuss it with originality and depth. Only one  review and one translation will be published in each issue, all written and/or  rendered into Portuguese (although the Journal may eventually consider the  publication of such genres in other language). <br>
        The Journal has a body of specialized peer-reviewers  who write reports that help the Editorial Board to base their decisions on.  Some of the criteria that influence editorial decisions are: textual and  academic quality, originality, innovation and diversity in themes and  approaches.</p>
    <p>Manuscripts must be submitted online to the address: <a href="http://periodicos.sbu.unicamp.br/ojs/index.php/tla/about/submissions" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=pt-BR&q=http://periodicos.sbu.unicamp.br/ojs/index.php/tla/about/submissions&source=gmail&ust=1474453950640000&usg=AFQjCNHcVFJP5n_xLBLIblyJWP8I_xIXgg">http://periodicos.sbu.unicamp.br/ojs/index.php/tla/about/submissions</a>. The latter specifies the procedures for the  author(s) registration and for the submission of the manuscript for peer  review. Author(s) must complete the registration, including institution, city  and country. All communication about the review process will be made through  the Journal&rsquo;s online system.</p>
    <p>There is no fee for submission and review articles.</p></td>

      <p><b>I. GENERAL PRINCIPLES</b><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
      <p>The following texts will be accepted: </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>1) Articles: up to 12,000 words maximum.<br>
2) Translations with commentary and interviews, which  shall adhere to the stylistic requirements outlined in &ldquo;publishing norms&rdquo;: 10,000  words maximum.<br>
3) Reviews of recently published books, which shall adhere to the  stylistic requirements outlined in &ldquo;publishing norms&rdquo;: 8,000 words maximum.</p>
</blockquote>
      <p><b>II. STRUCTURE OF ARTICLES</b></p>
      <p><b>1. Identification</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>a) The articles must be sent without the author's name, with TWO titles 
          on the first page, one in Portuguese and one in English;</p>
        <p>b) The articles must be sent in a word.doc file;</p>
        <p>c) The reviews must be accompanied by all the information to identify 
          the book or reference source (author, title, translator, if any, edition, 
          place, publisher, year of publication).</p>
        <p>d) If the article refers to the author's own  work - allowing&nbsp; identification - the  citations in  the body of the text, as well as in the Reference List, should come as in the following examples.  Example: AUTHOR (2004), AUTHOR (2009).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><b>2. Composition of the text and formatting</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>a) The body of the text should be typed in WORD format, 1.15 line-spaced, 
          12pt Times New Roman font;</p>
        <p>b) Emphasis: in italics;</p>
        <p>c) <i>Idem</i> or <i>idem, ibidem </i>must not be used<i>;</i></p>
        <p>d) Illustrations (tables, graphs, drawings, tables, trees, maps and 
          photographs) necessary to understand the text should be edited in black 
          and white, with numbering and title (only the first letter capitalized), 
          and they should be sent with a good graphic resolution;</p>
        <p>Example: <b>Table 1: </b>Content needed for an LD to be considered 
          good or excellent, according to students surveyed;</p>
        <p>6) Abstract: After the title, two abstracts should be included each 
          of no more than three hundred words typed in single spacing using 11pt 
          Times New Roman font. The first abstract must be written in the original 
          language of the article: Portuguese, English, French or Spanish (<b>RESUMO 
          / ABSTRACT / RESUM&Eacute; / RESUMEN</b>); the other in English. If the article 
          is written in English, the other abstract should be in Portuguese;</p>
        <p>f) Key words: After each of the abstracts, there must be three key 
          words in bold and in the language of the abstract (<b>Palavras-chave 
          / Keywords / Mots-cl&eacute;s /<strong>Palabras-clave</strong></b>).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><b>3. References of the text</b></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>a) References to authors</b></p>
        <p>The references to authors must be made in the text and be accompanied 
          by the following information, as the examples below: </p>
        <p>1) author's last name, with year of publication in parentheses, when 
          there is no textual citation. </p>
        <p>Example: We note that Gramsci (1977) believed that it was essential 
          to prioritize creativity over the activity...</p>
        <p>2) author's last name, with year and page in parentheses, when there 
          is a textual citation. </p>
        <p>Example: In this regard, according to Derrida (2002, p. 64), &quot;the 
          translation promises a kingdom to the reconciliation of languages&quot;.</p>
        <p>3) author's last name in CAPITALS, followed by year of publication, 
          when the author's last name is in parentheses. </p>
        <p>Example: The translation is conceived as an act of interpretation, 
          always provisional, which exerts influence on the translator and that 
          has a particular relationship with each language (MITTMANN, 2003).</p>
        <p><b>b) Quotes</b></p>
        <p>Quotes with up to three lines remain in the text, only highlighted 
          by quotation marks and not italicized.</p>
        <p>Quotes of more than three lines must come WITHOUT QUOTATION MARKS, 
          not italicized, highlighted in a paragraph by itself, single spaced, 
          font size 11, indented three centimeters from both left and right margins 
          of the text and separate from the paragraphs above and below it by an 
          extra line.</p>
        <p><b>c) Footnotes</b></p>
        <p>They must be only explanatory and appear as numbers overwritten in 
          the text, referring to the respective numbers in the page footer. They 
          must be written in the letter of the text, font size 10.</p>
        <p><b>d) References</b></p>
        <p>Three lines below the final line of the text, type: References (which 
          include the References and electronic references). </p>
        <p>1) Last names: all authors cited in the text should come in this section 
          listed alphabetically, in capital letters, followed by the initials 
          of all other names, as in:</p>
        <p>BARROS, D.L.P.</p>
        <p>COURT&Eacute;S, J. </p>
        <p>2) <b>Year of the original work</b>: must be enclosed in parentheses, 
          immediately after the author's last name. Example: </p>
        <p>KOCH, I. V. (2003). Desvendando os segredos do Texto, 2&#170; Ed. S&atilde;o Paulo: 
          Cortez.</p>
        <p>3) <b>Year of the translated/consulted version</b>: must come at the 
          end of the reference, without parentheses. Example: </p>
        <p>FREUD, S. (1900). <i>A Interpreta&ccedil;&atilde;o dos Sonhos</i>. Edi&ccedil;&atilde;o Standard 
          Brasileira das Obras Psicol&oacute;gicas Completas de Sigmund Freud. Trad. 
          Walderedo Ismael de Oliveira. Rio de Janeiro: Imago, 1976, v. IV, V.</p>
        <p>4) <b>References to books</b>: Title in <i>italics</i>, followed by 
          the name of the translator, if any, city name, followed by a colon, 
          name of the Publisher and volume number. Example:</p>
        <p>LACAN, J. (1960-1961). <i>O Semin&aacute;rio, livro 8, A Transfer&ecirc;ncia</i>, 
          trad. Dulce Duque Estrada. Rio de Janeiro: Jorge Zahar Ed., 1992.</p>
        <p>5) <b>References to chapters in books</b>: title in ordinary print

        <p>6) <b>References to journal articles</b>: title in ordinary print, 
          followed by the name of the journal in italics, issue of the journal
