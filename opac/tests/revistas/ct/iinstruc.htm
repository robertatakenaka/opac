   <p>The  journal&rsquo;s target readership consists of Brazilian and international  undergraduate and graduate students, professors, publishers, translators,  writers and researchers in Translation Studies and related areas. Submissions  are received on a continual basis for peer review.</p>
   <p>The  opinions expressed in this publication are those of the authors alone, for  which <em>Cadernos de Tradu&ccedil;&atilde;o</em> assumes no  liability.</p>
   <p>The procurement of rights to  reproduce images is the exclusive responsibility of submitting authors. The  journal assumes no responsibility for the images received. The following terms  must be accepted by the author in the submission Portal de Peri&oacute;dicos portal:</p>
   <p>I declare  that I am the author, licensee or that I have been granted express written  authorization by the rightsholder to reproduce the images found in the  manuscript I am submitting for publication in the SciELO-indexed journal <em>Cadernos de Tradu&ccedil;&atilde;o</em>, ISSN 2175-7968,  submitted through the UFSC <em>Portal de  Peri&oacute;dicos</em>.</p>

   <p>Original  articles, reviews, and interviews submitted to <em>Cadernos de Tradu&ccedil;&atilde;o</em> are forwarded to the Editor-in-chief and an  Assistant Editor (a member of the journal&rsquo;s Editorial Commission) for initial  evaluation to determine whether the manuscript falls within the journal&rsquo;s scope  and thus warrants a full external review.</p>
   <p>After  passing this preliminary evaluation, the manuscript will be sent to two  reviewers on the Editorial Board, Advisory Committee or ad hoc advisors,  depending on the theme. In case of disagreement between the reviewers, the  manuscript will be sent to a third reviewer. This process is to be concluded  within 3 to 6 months.</p>
   <p>All  reviewers receive the manuscripts through the official portal and perform a  blind review according to a standardized set of criteria, which includes the  signing of a conflict of interest statement.</p>
   <p>Note:  &lsquo;Conflict of interest&rsquo; is understood as when a financial or personal relationship exists between an author (or the author&rsquo;s institution), reviser,  peer-reviewer or editor that could inappropriately influence (i.e. bias) their  actions.</p>
<p>Manuscripts may be:<br>
-Accepted as submitted without alteration<br>
-Accepted pending certain alterations<br>
-Rejected<br>
-Rigorous measures are taken to ensure the peer review process is fully blinded (i.e. the  Microsoft Word file submitted for peer review must not contain  personal/institutional information): personal information is to be furnished on  a separate form during the five-step submission process. These data will be  used only if the manuscript is accepted for publication.<br>
-Submitting  authors will be advised of the peer-review results, whether positive or  negative, through the system&rsquo;s author portal.<br>
-The  Advisory Committee and the Editorial Board reserve the right not to comment on  the reasons for a refusal.<br>
-The journal reserves the right to evaluate only one  manuscript per author per year</p></td>

   <p><em>Cadernos de Tradu&ccedil;&atilde;o</em> features the following permanent sections:&nbsp; <strong>Articles,  Reviews, Translation Reviews, Translated Articles and Interviews.</strong>   
   <p><strong>Thematic Regular issues</strong><br>
     Occasionally, researchers of recognized experience in  a specific area of Translation Studies are invited to organize a special issue,  which will substitute one of the regular quarterly issues.</p>
   <p>The special issue&rsquo;s organizer may be a professor at  the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina or at another prestigious national  or international institution, or researchers from different institutions may  collaborate to organize and evaluate the articles.</p>
   <p>The organizer will be the first to evaluate the  manuscripts received for the special edition. The second evaluator will be  assigned by the Editor-in-chief of <em>Cadernos  de Tradu&ccedil;&atilde;o</em>, who, together with the organizer, will set up an ad hoc  editorial and peer-review team whose members&rsquo; research aligns with the theme of  the edition.</p>
   <p>The review process for special editions, like that of  regular editions, is blinded. The only difference between the editions is the  fixed submission deadline for special editions, unlike the regular rolling  submission process. Authors, therefore, must be attentive to the deadline  announced in our website, social networks and emails.</p>
   <p><strong>Dossiers</strong></p>
   <p>Occasionally researchers of recognized experience in a  specific area of Translation Studies are invited to organize a dossier in an  issue of <em>Cadernos de Tradu&ccedil;&atilde;o.</em> The  articles in a dossier must be in agreement with the scope and focus of the  journal and are presented as a separate section within a regular issue. The  dossier&rsquo;s organizer may be a professor at the Universidade Federal de Santa  Catarina or at another prestigious national or international institution, or  researchers from different institutions may collaborate to organize and  evaluate the articles. The organizer will be the first to evaluate the  manuscripts received for the dossier. The second evaluator will be assigned by  the Editor-in-chief of <em>Cadernos de  Tradu&ccedil;&atilde;o</em>, who, together with the organizer, will set up an ad hoc editorial  and peer-review team whose members&rsquo; research aligns with the theme of the  dossier. As in regular editions, the review process for dossiers is blinded. A  variety of dossiers have been featured in the journal, making a contribution to  its growth by fostering valuable discussion on national and international  levels and reinforcing the interdisciplinary character of the field.</p>
   <p><strong>Articles</strong></p>
   <p>Article selection criteria include: originality,  clarity and relevance within the field. Manuscripts presenting a critical  analysis of subjects pertaining to Translation Studies are welcome.</p>
   <p><strong>Book Reviews</strong></p>
   <p>The Review section publishes original texts that  comment critically on relevant works in the field of Translation Studies  (translation theory, criticism or history) published within the last five  years. Reviews should include an abstract and a critical evaluation of the work  and should contain between 2000-4000 words. Reviews of adaptations, filmic or  otherwise, related to translation, are welcome.</p>
   <p><strong>Translation Reviews</strong></p>
   <p>The Translation Review section publishes original  texts that comment critically on translated works of any genre or language  pair. Translation reviews should include data about the work, the author and  the translator, as well as analysis of the most relevant aspects of the source  and translated texts and their respective contexts. They should contain between  2000-4000 words.</p>
   <p><strong>Interviews</strong></p>
   <p>Interviews  with translators, professors and authorities in Translation Studies and related  fields are welcome.</p>
   <p><strong>Translated articles</strong></p>
<p>Original translations of articles of fundamental  importance to the field of Translation Studies are also welcome.</p></td>

   <p><strong>Author guidelines</strong>   
   <p><br>
     <strong>Guidelines for manuscript  preparation</strong>   
   <p><br>
     Accepted  languages for publication include English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese  and Spanish. Consistent usage and spelling are expected throughout, e.g. do not  mix British English and American English.   
   <p><br>
     1) The  manuscript must be previously unpublished, and must not be under consideration  for publication in another journal.<br>
     2) The  manuscript must provide a title in English as well as in the language of the  article, if different (without exception).<br>
     3) The  first page of the document must begin with the title in the language of the  article.<strong></strong><br>
     4) The  title must be followed by an abstract of up to 200 words in the language of the  article which clearly expresses the purpose of the work. This must be followed  by a translation of the title and abstract to English, if the article is not  written in English (without exception).<br>
     5)  Articles should not exceed 5000 words (excluding bibliography and endnotes);  book reviews and translation reviews should contain between 2000-4000 words.<br>
     6) The  Microsoft Word document should be configured with the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; margin setting,  1.5 line spacing and 12 point Times New Roman font.<br>
     7)  Portuguese texts should be formatted according to ABNT (<em>Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Brasileira de Normas T&eacute;cnicas</em>) NBR6022 (May 2003).  Articles in other languages should conform to MLA guidelines <a href="http://www.durhamcollege.ca/wp-content/uploads/MLA.pdf">http://www.durhamcollege.ca/wp-content/uploads/MLA.pdf</a><br>
     &nbsp;[recommended link]. Articles translated into  Portuguese may conform to either ABNT or MLA guidelines.<br>
     8) Quotes  within the body of the manuscript should be formatted according to either ABNT  (for Portuguese articles) or MLA (for all other languages) guidelines, in  conformity to point 7, above. See ABNT norms (2002) NBR10520 (regarding  citations) and NBR6023 (regarding references)   
   <p><strong>Important:</strong>   
   <p>- All  sources cited the manuscript must also appear in the References section at the  end of the article.<br>
     - Only  sources directly cited in the manuscript should appear in the References  section.   
   <p>9)  Immediately following the abstract must appear a series of keywords, written in  the language of the abstract (e.g. one set in Portuguese after the Portuguese  abstract and another in English after the English abstract). Keywords should be  separated by a period(/full stop). The use of three to five keywords is  suggested.<br>
     10)  Manuscript pages should not be numbered. Underlining and boldface should be  kept to a minimum.<br>
     11)  Endnotes should be used rather than footnotes.<br>
     12) All  tables and figures (drawings, graphs, photos, etc.) must appear within the body  of the manuscript near the place where they are mentioned in the text. Do not  send figures as separate documents. Please ensure that figures are of the  highest possible resolution.<br>
     13) The  grammatical and orthographic revision of a manuscript is the exclusive  responsibility of its authors.   
   <p><strong>IMPORTANT INFORMATION: </strong>Manuscripts are submitted to the journal&rsquo;s  Editorial Board and Advisory Committee and will be evaluated in accordance with  the journal&rsquo;s periodicity. The acceptance of manuscripts is at the sole  discretion of these bodies, who are at liberty to make suggestions about both  presentation and content. Manuscripts that do not conform to the editorial  norms presented above will be returned for adjustments.</p>
   <p>- The opinions expressed in this publication are  those of the authors alone, for which <em>Cadernos  de Tradu&ccedil;&atilde;o</em> assumes no liability.</p></td>
