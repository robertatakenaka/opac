      <p>GENERAL ORIENTATIONS</p>
      <p>Revista Brasileira de Zoologia (RBZool), the journal of the Sociedade 
        Brasileira de Zoologia (SBZ), publishes original scientific articles on 
        Zoology, authored by members and non-members of the Society. Members of 
        the SBZ publish free of charge, whereas non-members are required to pay 
        page charges, as indicated in the updated price list published in the 
        Society’s homepage (<a href="http://www.sbzoologia.org.br" target="_blank">http://www.sbzoologia.org.br</a>).</p>
      <p>Manuscripts should be prepared preferentially in English but Portuguese 
        is accepted. The authors should be aware that the intention of the editorial 
        board of RBZool is to only publish articles in English in the near future. 
        Manuscript submission to RBZool is available online only at the address 
        <a href="http://submission.scielo.br/index.php/rbzool/index" target="_blank">http://submission.scielo.br/index.php/rbzool/index</a>. 
        Register in this page at least as author of the Revista Brasileira de 
        Zoologia. The system is user-friendly and allows authors to monitor the 
        submission process. All documents should be prepared with a word processor 
        software (preferably MS WORD or compatible).</p>
      <p>RBZool refrains from publishing simple occurrence notes, new records 
        (e.g. geographic, host), distribution notes, case studies, list of species, 
        and similar purely descriptive studies, unless well justified by the authors. 
        Justification should be sent prior submission to the Managing Editor.&nbsp;A 
        new journal, Zoologia Letters, is being prepared to attend the need of 
        publication of significant new records, morphological and behavioral notes 
        and other short notes considered of importance to the understanding of 
        animal evolution, biogeography, or biology.</p>
      <p>RESPONSIBILITY</p>
      <p>Manuscripts are received by RBZool with the understanding that:</p>
      <p>– all authors have approved submission;</p>
      <p>– the results or ideas contained therein are original;</p>
      <p>– the paper is not under consideration for publication elsewhere and 
        will not be submitted elsewhere unless rejected by RBZool or withdrawn 
        by written notification to the Managing Editor;</p>
      <p>– if accepted for publication and published, the article, or portions 
        thereof, will not be published elsewhere unless consent is obtained in 
        writing from the Managing Editor;</p>
      <p>– reproduction and fair use of articles in RBZool are permitted provided 
        the intended use is for nonprofit educational purposes. All other use 
        requires consent and fees where appropriate;</p>
      <p>– the obligation for page charges and text revision fees is accepted 
        by the authors.</p>
      <p>– the authors are fully responsible for the scientific content and grammar 
        of the article.</p>

      <p>FORMS OF PUBLICATION</p>
      <p><i>Articles</i>: original articles on all areas of the Zoology.</p>
      <p><i>Short Communications</i>: this form of publication represents succinct, 
        definitive information (as opposed to preliminary results) that does not 
        lend itself to inclusion in a typical, more comprehensive article. A new 
        or modified technique may be presented as a research note only if the 
        technique is not to be used in ongoing studies. Ordinarily, techniques 
        are incorporated into the materials and methods section of a regular article.</p>
      <p><i>Review articles</i>: only invited reviews are published. Unsolicited 
        reviews should not be submitted, but topics may be suggested to the editor 
        or members of the editorial board.</p>
      <p><i>Opinion: </i>letters to the editor, comments on other publications 
        and ideas, overviews and other texts that are characterized as the opinion 
        of one or a group of scientists.</p>
      <p><i>Book reviews</i>: books having a broad interest to the membership 
        of the Society are reviewed by invitation.</p>
      <p><i>Short biography</i>: biography of important zoologists that significantly 
        contributed with the knowledge on animal sciences.<br clear=all>
      </p>
      <p>MANUSCRIPTS</p>
      <p>The text should be left-justified and the pages numbered. The front page 
        must include: 1) the title of the article including the name(s) of the 
        higher taxonomic category(ies) of the animals treated; 2) the name(s) 
        of the author(s) with their professional affiliation. 3) Name of the Corresponding 
        Author with complete addresses for correspondence, including e-mail; 4) 
        an abstract and key words in same language of the article, or in Portuguese 
        if the article is in English, and equivalent to those used in the English 
        abstract; 5) up to five key words in English, in alphabetical order and 
        different of those words used in the title. The total information on the 
        items 1 to 5 cannot exceed 3,500 characters including the spaces.</p>
      <p>Literature citations should be typed in small capitals, as follows: Smith 
        (1990), (Smith 1990), Smith (1990: 128), Smith (1990, 1995), Lent &amp; 
        Jurberg (1965), Guimar&atilde;es <i>et al.</i> (1983). Articles by the same author 
        or sequences of citations should be in chronological order.</p>
      <p>Only the names of genera and species should be typed in italics. The 
        first citation of an animal or plant taxon in the text must be accompanied 
        by its author’s name in full, the date (of plants, if possible) and the 
        family.</p>
      <p>The manuscript of scientific articles should be organized as indicated 
        below. Other major sections and subdivisions are possible but the Managing 
        Editor and the Editorial Committee should accept the proposed subdivision.</p>
      <p>Articles and Invited Review</p>
      <p><i>Title.</i> Avoid verbiage such as “preliminary studies on...” and 
        “biology or ecology of...”. Do not use author and date citations with 
        scientific names in the title. When taxon names are mentioned in the title, 
        it should be followed by the indication of higher categories in parenthesis.</p>
      <p><i>Abstract.</i> The abstract should be factual (as opposed to indicative) 
        and should outline the objective, methods used, conclusions, and significance 
        of the study. Text of the abstract should not be subdivided nor should 
        it contain literature citations. It should contain a single paragraph.</p>
      <p><i>Key words.</i> Up to five key words in English, in alphabetical order 
        and different of those words used in the title, separated by semicolon. 
        Avoid using composite key words.</p>
      <p><i>Resumo.</i> The abstract in Portuguese equivalent to those used in 
        the English abstract.</p>
      <p><i>Palavras-chave. </i>Up to five key words in Portuguese and equivalent 
        to those used in the English key words.</p>
      <p><i>Introduction.</i> The introduction should establish the context of 
        the paper by stating the general field of interest, presenting findings 
        of others that will be challenged or expanded, and specifying the specific 
        question to be addressed. Accounts of previous work should be limited 
        to the minimum information necessary to give an appropriate perspective. 
        The introduction should not be subdivided.</p>
      <p><i>Material and Methods.</i> This section should be short and concise. 
        It should give sufficient information to permit repetition of the study 
        by others. Previously published or standard techniques must be referenced, 
        but not detailed. If the material and methods section is short, it should 
        not be subdivided. Avoid extensive division into paragraphs.</p>
      <p><i>Results.</i> This section should contain a concise account of the 
        new information. Tables and figures are to be used as appropriate, but 
        information presented in them should not be repeated in the text. Avoid 
        detailing methods and interpreting results in this section.</p>
      <p><b>Taxonomic papers</b> have a distinct style that must be adhered to 
        in preparing a manuscript. In taxonomic papers<b> </b>the results section 
        is to be replaced by a section headed DESCRIPTION, beginning at the left-hand 
        margin. The description is followed with a taxonomic summary section. 
        The <b>taxonomic summary</b> section comprises a listing of site, locality 
        and specimens deposited (with respective collection numbers). The appropriate 
        citation sequence and format include: Country, <i>Province or State</i>: 
        City or County (minor area as locality, neighborhood, and others, lat 
        long, altitude, all in parenthesis), number of specimens, sex, collection 
        date, collector followed by the word <i>leg.</i>, collection number. This 
        is a general guideline that should be adapted to different situations 
        and groups. Several examples can be found at the website of SBZ. The taxonomic 
        summary is followed by a remarks section. The <b>remarks</b> section replaces 
        the discussion of other articles and gives comparisons to similar taxa. 
        Museum accession numbers for appropriate type material (new taxa) and 
        for voucher specimens (surveys) are required. Type specimens, especially 
        holotypes (syntypes, cotypes), should not be maintained in a private collection. 
        Appropriate photographic material should be deposited if necessary. Frozen 
        tissues must also include accession numbers if deposited in a museum.</p>
      <p><i>Discussion.</i> An interpretation and explanation of the relationship 
        of the results to existing knowledge should appear in the discussion section. 
        Emphasis should be placed on the important new findings, and new hypotheses 
        should be identified clearly. Conclusions must be supported by fact or 
        data. Subdivision are possible.</p>
      <p><i>Acknowledgments. </i>These should be concise. Ethics require that 
        colleagues be consulted before being acknowledged for their assistance 
        in the study.</p>
      <p><i>Literature Cited. C</i>itations are arranged alphabetically. All references 
        cited in the text must appear in the literature cited section and all 
        items in this section must be cited in the text. Citation of unpublished 
        studies or reports is not permitted, i.e., a volume and page number must 
        be available for serials and a city, publisher, and full pagination for 
        books. Abstracts not subjected to peer review may not be cited. Work may 
        be cited as “in press” only exceptionally. If absolutely necessary, a 
        statement may be documented in the text of the paper by “pers. comm.”, 
        providing the person cited is aware of the manuscript and the reference 
        to his person therein. Personal communications do not appear in the Literature 
        Cited section.</p>
      <p>The references cited in the text should be listed at the end of the manuscript, 
        according to the examples below.</p>
      <p>The title of each periodical must be complete, without abbreviations.</p>

        [date of access].</p>
      <p><i>Illustrations and Tables. </i>Photographs, line drawings, graphs, 
        and maps should be termed figures. Photos must be clear and have good 
        contrast. Please, organize, whenever possible, line drawings (including 
        graphics, if it is the case) as plates of figures or pictures considering 
        the size of the page of the journal.&nbsp;Never create plates with line 
        figures and half-tone together!</p>
      <p>The size of an illustration, if necessary, should be indicated using 
        horizontal or vertical scale bars (never as a magnification in the legend).</p>
      <p>Each figure must be numbered in Arabic numerals in the lower right corner. 
        When preparing the illustrations, authors should bear in mind that the 
        journal has a matter size of 17.0 by 21.0 cm and a column size of 8,3 
        by 21,0 cm including space for captions. Figures must be referred to in 
        numerical sequence in the text; indicate the approximate placement of 
        each figure in the margins of the manuscript.</p>
      <p>All figures should be inserted at the end of the text, following the 
        tables for review purposes.&nbsp;The authors should be aware that, if 
        accepted for publication in RBZool, all figures and graphics should be 
        sent to the editor in the adequate quality (below).</p>
      <p>Illustrations must be saved and sent as separate TIFF files with LZW 
        compression. The required final resolution is 300 dpi for half-tone or 
        color photos and 600 dpi for line art. Do not send original drawings or 
        photos when submitting the manuscript unless specifically requested by 
        the editor. Color figures can be published if the additional cost is covered 
        by the author. These figures should be also incorporated, with a lower 
        resolution, directly in the manuscript for review purposes only.</p>
      <p>Tables should be generated by the table function of the word-processing 
        program being used, numbered in Roman numerals and inserted after the 
        list of figures captions.</p>
      <p>Captions of the figures should be typewritten right after the References. 
        Use a separate paragraph for the caption of each figure or group of figures.</p>
      <p>Short Communications</p>
      <p>Manuscripts are to be organized in a format similar to original articles 
        with the following modifications.</p>
      <p><i>Text</i>. The text of a research note (i.e. Introduction + Material 
        and methods + Discussion) is written directly, without sections. Acknowledgments 
        may be given, without heading, as the last paragraph. Literature is cited 
        in the text as described for articles.</p>
      <p><i>Literature cited, tables, figure captions, and figures</i>. These 
        items are in the form and sequence described for articles.</p>
      <p>Opinions</p>
      <p><i>Title</i>. Simply provide a title for the opinion</p>
      <p><i>Text</i>. Should be concise, objective and contain no figures (unless 
        absolutely necessary).</p>
      <p><i>Name and address of author</i>. This information follows the text 
        or, if present, the literature cited section. The reviewer’s name should 
        be in bold type.</p>
      <p>Book reviews</p>
      <p><i>Title</i>. Give the title of the book, cited as indicated below:</p>
      <p><b>Toxoplasmosis of Animals and Man</b>, by J.P. Dubey &amp; C.P. Beattie. 
        1988. Boca Raton, CRC Press, 220p.</p>
      <p>The words “edited by” are substituted for “by” when appropriate.</p>
      <p><i>Text</i>. The text usually is not subdivided. If literature must be 
        cited, a headed literature cited section follows the text in the style 
        described for articles. Figures and tables should not be used.</p>
      <p><i>Name and address of author</i>. This information follows the text 
        or, if present, the literature cited section. The reviewer’s name should 
        be in bold type.</p>
      <p>Short biographies</p>
      <p><i>Title.</i> Give the name of the person for which this biography is 
        being written in boldface, followed by the date of birth and death (if 
        it is the case), in parenthesis.</p>
      <p><b>Lauro Travassos </b>(1890-1970)</p>
      <p><i>Text.</i> The text usually is not subdivided. If literature must be 
        cited, a headed literature cited section follows the text in the style 
        described for articles. Figures and tables should not be used.</p>
      <p><i>Name and address of author.</i> This information follows the text 
        or, if present, the literature cited section. The reviewer’s name should 
        be in bold type.</p>
      <p>PROCEDURES</p>
      <p>Manuscripts submitted to RBZool will be initially evaluated by the Managing 
        and Assistant Editor for adequacy and to determine the specific area.&nbsp;A 
        first evaluation of the English (if it is the case) is performed at this 
        moment. Manuscripts with problems may be returned to the authors. Once 
        the area is determined/confirmed, the manuscript is sent to the appropriate 
        Section Editor by the Managing Editor. The Section Editor sends the manuscript 
        for Reviewers.&nbsp;The copies of the manuscript with the Reviewers’ comments 
        and the Section Editor’s decision will be returned to the corresponding 
        author for evaluation. Once approved, copies of the manuscript, Reviewers 
        comments, Section Editor’s comments, together with the corrected version 
        and the respective figure files, properly identified, must be returned 
        to the Managing Editor (always using the online system of submission). 
        Exceptionally, the Managing Editor may, after consultation with the Section 
        Editors, modify the recommendation of Reviewers if well justified.&nbsp;Later 
        changes or additions to the manuscript may be rejected. Electronic proofs 
        will be e-mailed to the corresponding author prior to publication.</p>
      <p>REPRINTS</p>
      <p>The corresponding author will receive an electronic reprint (in PDF format) 
        after publication. Authors may print and distribute hardcopies of their 
        article on demand. Authors may also send the electronic file to individuals, 
        as one would send a printed reprint. However, we would appreciate if you 
        refrain from distributing PDF files via discussion groups and bulk-mail 
        systems.  It is important for RBZool that users access the journal homepage 
        for statistical purposes.  Thus, by doing this, you are helping increase 
        the indexes of quality of RBZool. </p>
      <p>VOUCHER AND TYPE SPECIMENS</p>
      <p>Manuscripts must report the museums or the institutions where the specimens 
        (types or vouchers) are deposited and respective deposit numbers whenever 
        possible.</p>
