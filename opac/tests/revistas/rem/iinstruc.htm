    <td WIDTH="70%"><p><strong>Rem: Revista Escola de Minas</strong> (School of Mines  Magazine) is one of the first technical (mining and metallurgy) magazines in  South America. It was founded in January 1936, and has specialized in the  publication of articles concerning the Civil, Geological, Metallurgical and  Materials, Mechanic and Energy and Mining Engineerings.</p>
    <p>Its  objective is to provide publication opportunities for national and  international researchers engaged in the abovementioned fields. Original  technical-scientific contributions (articles and letters) are accepted. Revised  articles depend upon invitation and/or Editor's analysis.</p>
    <p>The presentation of articles for publication implies  that the paper has not been previously published; that it is not being  presented to any other magazine for publication; and that it will not be  published in the same form in any other place without written authorization  from the Editors.</p>
<p>The Editor, Associate Editor and members of the  Editorial Board will seek competent reviews of papers prior to accepting them  for publication or recommending revisions. The Associate Editor, who assumes  complete responsibility for decisions regarding manuscripts, could eventually  disregard the recommendations of the examiners. The Editor will advise the  authors when a paper is rejected and no communication regarding these  manuscripts will be made to other magazines.</p>
<p>Responsibility  for approval of the paper by all coauthors rests with the submitting author.  During preparation of manuscripts, authors must read and carefully follow the  guidelines presented here. Questions should be directed to the Editor at <a href="mailto:editor@rem.com.br">editor@rem.com.br</a>.</p>
<p>Our journals require you to add Preferred and/or Non-Preferred Reviewers  and/or Editors for your manuscript, and they should not belong to your  institution. It is up to the Associate Editor to accept, or not, your  indication.</p>
<p><strong>Mandatory:<br>
When there are more  than five authors (team work), the editors have the authority to request that  the authors justify their inclusion in the article.</strong></p></td>

    <p>Regular articles, focused on new data, may discuss any  aspect of the areas that <strong>REM</strong> deals with. These articles are reviewed by at  least two expert readers indicated by the Associate Editor</p>
    <p>The article's outline should maintain the following  standard format for publication:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Title </strong>(Avoid long titles and unnecessary words: &ldquo;Study about...&rdquo;, &ldquo;Contribution  to...&rdquo;)</li>
      <li><strong>Authors</strong> (organize by level of research participation)</li>
      <li><strong>Abstract</strong> (Each paper must be preceded by an abstract presenting a concise summary of the facts contained in the article, keywords, illuminating important facts and conclusions. This abstract of about 150 to 250 words is required. No references, figures, or tables should be included in the abstract.)</li>
      <li><strong>Introduction</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Material and method</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Results</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Discussion</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Conclusions</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Acknowledgments</strong></li>
      <li><strong>References</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Text</em></p>
    <p>Articles will be accepted in English.  Microsoft Word is the recommended software for the body of the paper. Articles should be precise, not longer than 08 pages in <strong>size  12 Times New Roman font</strong>, including abstracts, illustrations, tables,  bibliographical references, etc. Use the indent function for paragraphs  and automatic pagination.</p>
    <p>Papers should be typed with automatic spacing (given a  space between each item). The paper to be used is A4 and should have 2cm  margins. The text should not be presented in columns.</p>
    <p>The illustrations (photos, maps, tables etc.) should be inserted in the  text and <strong>must be sent</strong> along with the text as&nbsp;jpg or tif or  excel extensions.</p>
    <p><em>Line drawings</em></p>
    <ul><li>Definition: Black and white graphic with no shading.</li>
      <li>Do not use faint lines and/or lettering and check that  all lines and lettering within the figures are legible at final size.</li>
      <li>All lines should be at least 0.1 mm (0.3 pt) wide.</li>
      <li>Scanned line drawings and line drawings in bitmap  format should have a minimum resolution of 1200 dpi.</li>
      <li>Vector graphics containing fonts must have the fonts embedded in the  files.</li>
      <li>Shades  of gray in drawings should be no less than 20% apart to be distinguished easily  in print.</li>
      </ul>
    <p><em>Tables</em></p>
    <ul><li>All tables are to be sequentially numbered, using Arabic  numerals. Use  Word or Excel &#150; a format that we can edit for style.</li>
      <li>Tables should always be cited within the text in consecutive numerical  order.</li>
      <li>Footnotes to tables should be indicated by superscript lower-case  letters (or asterisks for significance values and other statistical data) and  included beneath the table body.</li>
      <li>Table legends&nbsp;must be brief, and self-sufficient  explanations of the illustrations. The legends should be placed at the top  of the text.</li>
    </ul>
<p><em>Photos</em></p>
<p>Photos should be scanned at no less than 300 dpi. Scanned photos with  lettering should be scanned at no less than 600 dpi. This is to compensate for  text (including arrows) that is bitmapped when scanned. An alternate solution  is to place art in a vector program (Illustrator or CorelDraw, for example) and  then add text and arrows.</p>
<p>The correct resolution to black and white  photo: keep to a minimum of 0.5 MB</p>
<p>Please make sure that artwork files are in an acceptable format (TIFF or  JPEG or EPS or PDF), and with the correct resolution: keep to a minimum of 0.8  MB.</p>
<p><em>Color  photos/art:</em></p>
<p><strong>REM</strong> publishes up to four (4) photographs in color.  Beyond this number is at the author's expense.</p>
<p>If, together with your accepted article, you submit  usable color figures, then <strong>REM</strong> will ensure, at no additional charge, that these  figures will appear in color online regardless of whether or not these  illustrations are reproduced in color in the printed version. <strong>For color  reproduction in print &#150; for more than 4 photos, you will receive  information regarding the costs from REM after receipt of your accepted article</strong>. Color  approved by the Editor is free for <strong>REM</strong> subscribers; otherwise  it is $50/photo or page. Please indicate your  preference for color: <em>in print</em> or <em>online only</em>.</p>
<p>Because of technical complications that can arise by  converting color figures to &ldquo;gray scale&rdquo; (for the printed version, if you do  not opt for color in print), please submit in addition usable black and white  versions of all the color illustrations.</p>
<p><em>Plates</em></p>
<p>Several figures or figure parts should be grouped in a  plate on one page.</p>
<p><em>Size of figures</em></p>
<p>The figures should match the width of the column,  either (6.3 cm) or (12.6 cm).</p>
<p><em>Figure legends</em></p>
<p>Must be brief, self-sufficient explanations of the illustrations.  The legends should be placed at the end of the text.</p>
<p><strong>Mandatory:<br>
When illustrations (figure, photo, tables, etc.) have already been published  at another source, furnish the source and reproduction permission.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Readers  can debate all the articles published in <strong>REM</strong>.</li>
  <li>Letters  should be concise, not more than 05 pages including abstract, illustrations,  tables, bibliographic references, etc. In very special cases, a superior number  of pages will be accepted, providing the data presented is extremely important  to the understanding of the topic in discussion.</li>
  <li>Papers  should be typed following the publication format of <strong>REM</strong> articles.</li>
  <li>After  Editorial analysis, letters and their replies will be listed in the index of  the volume in which they were published.</li>
</ul>

    <p><strong>REM</strong> can publish information on recent discoveries or developments in the  above-mentioned fields. Letters should be concise, not more than 2 pages,  including abstracts, illustrations, tables, bibliographic references, etc. They  should be typed according to the standard publication format of <strong>REM</strong> articles.</p>
    <p><strong>Thesis  Abstracts</strong></p>
    <p><strong>REM</strong> will publish thesis abstracts, if submitted. They should be typed in  both Portuguese/Spanish and English.</p>
    <p><strong>News</strong></p>
    <p><strong>REM</strong> will publish engineering news, including book/magazine launchings,  congresses, etc., for companies and educational institutions.</p>
    <p><strong>Bibliographic  references</strong></p>
