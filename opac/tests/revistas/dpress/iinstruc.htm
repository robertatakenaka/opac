      <p><b>Phases for Publishing the Articles</b> 

      <p>One of the main purposes of Dental Press Magazine is to preserve the 

        idoneity of the published articles, being valorized by the odontologic 

        class. Therefore, all the articles received by Dental Press is submitted 

        to the following process:</p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p>1) The articles are received at the head-office. The responsible staff 

          checks the material and let the author know it has arrived.</p>

        <p>2) One of the copies of the article is sent to the Magazine Editorial 

          Staff for evaluation.</p>

        <p>3) The members of the Editorial Staff select 2 professionals, among 

          the 88 consultants and co-workers of the magazine, in order to evaluate 

          the article. In this phase the &quot;double bind&quot; system is used, 

          that is, the name of the authors are omitted on purpose so that the 

          analysis of the study is not influenced, and the authors, although informed 

          on the current method, do not know who the responsible staff for evaluating 

          their work is.</p>

        <p>4) Enclosed to the article, each consultant receives a questionnaire 

          that will allow them to draw observations and determine if the article 

          will be published or not. The model of such questionnaire can be further 

          observed. When giving the article and the filled questionnaire back 

          to Dental Press, each consultant chooses if he wants or not to revise 

          the article once more.</p>

        <p>5) The article will be selected for publishing only if both consultants 

          approve it. If one of them refuses it, the article will be sent to a 

          third consultant.</p>

        <p> 6) If it is necessary, the article will be sent to the authors so 

          that the corrections suggested by the consultants are performed.</p>

        <p>7) Back to the office, the article will be submitted to the correction 

          of both the references and the norms of the Brazilian Association of 

          the Technical Norms (ABNT), a procedure that is carried out by the office's 

          librarian who is currently a member of the ABNT&acute;s committee. </p>

        <p>8) Professionals in charge of performing the diagrams and publishing 

          make the article suitable for the graphic criteria of the Magazine.</p>

        <p>9) Properly diagrammed and revised, the article is sent to the Scientific 

          Board of the Magazine to be revised, observing the arrangement of the 

          pictures, plots, text, abstracts, key words, and other components. </p>

        <p>10) Finally, the article is sent to the author who will make the last 

          information available. Only during this phase of the process, the authors 

          are informed on the edition in which his article will be published.</p>

        <p>11) The articles and other materials of each edition are brought together, 

          forming the &quot;sketch&quot; of the magazine that is revised page 

          by page, picture by picture, letter by letter by the magazine's art 

          editor who assumes the role of &quot;Ombudsman&quot;.</p>

        <p>12) Only after performing the last corrections in the &quot;sketch&quot;, 

          the graphic and printing phases are properly initiated.</p>
