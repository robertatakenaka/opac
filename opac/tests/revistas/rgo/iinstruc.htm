    <p><b>Journal&rsquo;s editorial policy</b></p>
    <p>The <b>Revista Ga&uacute;cha de Odontologia (<b>RGO</b></b>) is a quarterly journal whose aim is to disseminate and promote the exchange of information in the various areas of dental research, providing both the national and international scientific communities with a formal communication channel and thereby contributing to the advancement of knowledge.</p>
    <p>Manuscripts may be rejected without detailed comments after an initial analysis by at least two <b>RGO</b></b> editors if the articles are deemed to be inappropriate to the scope of the review or to have insufficient scientific priority for publication in the Review.</p>
    <p><b>Article category </b></p>
    <p>The Journal accepts original articles in the Portuguese, Spanish or English languages, consisting of a title, abstract and indexing terms in the original language and in English, in the following categories: </p>
    <p>a) Original: contributions of an empirical, experimental or conceptual nature designed to publish the results of new research studies taking into consideration the relevance of the topic, the scope and the knowledge generated for the area of the study; </p>
    <p>b) Review (by invitation): critical summary of the available knowledge on a particular topic, by means of the analysis and interpretation of pertinent bibliography, so as to contain a critical, comparative analysis of studies in the area, which discusses the limits and scope of the methodology, permitting an indication of perspectives for the continuity of studies in that line of research. Up to two studies will be published in every issue; </p>
    <p>c) Communication: an account of information on relevant topics, backed by recent research, supporting the work of professionals working in the area, acting as an introduction to the topic or an update thereof; </p>
    <p>d) Clinical Case: these are articles that represent descriptive data of one or more cases exploring a method or problem using examples. It should present the characteristics of the human individual or animal being studied with an indication of their characteristics, which shall include gender, socioeconomic level and age, amongst others. </p>
    <p><b>Studies involving living creatures</b></p>
    <p>The results of studies related to human beings or animals should be accompanied by a copy of the approval of the opinion of an Ethics Research Committee. </p>
    <p><b>Records of Clinical Trials</b></p>
    <p>Articles with results of clinical studies should include an identification number from one of the Clinical Trials Registers validated by the criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), whose addresses are available from the ICMJE website. The identification should be recorded at the end of the abstract. </p>
    <p><b>Journal&rsquo;s peer review procedures</b></p>
    <p>Any originals failing to comply with the policies published herein, in respect of form of presentation, will be summarily returned even before they are submitted for an evaluation as to the merit of the work and the suitability for publication. The return will be accompanied by a letter containing the code of the offending item.</p>
    <p>The manuscripts that are approved for form of presentation will be forwarded to the Editorial Council, which will consider the scientific merit of the contribution. Once approved in this phase, the manuscripts will be forwarded to the ad hoc reviewers selected in advance by the Council. Each manuscript will be sent to two adjudicators who are recognized as authorities in the subject matter. In the event of any disagreement, the original will be sent for a third evaluation. Those works that are not, in the judgment of the Editorial Council or the ad hoc Reviewers, deemed suitable for publication in the <b>RGO</b>, will be definitively returned to the authors.</p>
    <p>The peer review process is a blind review system, a confidential procedure with regard to the identity of both the authors and the reviewers. The names of the authors are purposely omitted so that the analysis of the paper is not in any way influenced and, similarly, the authors, although they are informed of the method in effect, are not aware of who is responsible for the examination of their work. In the event that a conflict of interest is identified on the part of the reviewers, the Editorial Council will pass the manuscript to another ad hoc reviewer. The opinions of the examiners entail three possibilities: a) acceptance in full; b) acceptance with some reformulation; c) complete rejection. In all cases the author will be informed.</p>
    <p>The final decision on whether the manuscript is published or not always remains with the editors, who reserve the right to carry out any adjustments they feel appropriate. If a problem with the wording is detected, the manuscript will be returned to the authors for the appropriate alterations to be made. The reformulated work should be resubmitted by the specified deadline. </p>
    <p><b>Specification of the journal&rsquo;s audience</b></p>
    <p>The <b>RGO</b> is open to receiving contributions from both the national and international scientific communities, which contribute to scientific studies and development in the area of Dentistry, and its subsidiary areas.</p></td>

      <p><b>Submission of papers</b></p>
      <p>Papers will be accepted that are accompanied by a declaration of responsibility, declaration of agreement with the transfer of copyright and a letter signed by all the authors, with a description of the type of study and subject matter and the study&rsquo;s main contributions to the area.</p>
      <p>If any figures are selected from other previously published studies, the authors should obtain and provide written permission for their reproduction. This authorization should accompany the manuscripts submitted for publication. </p>
      <p>Authorship: the number of authors should be consistent with the size of the project. The credit for authorship should be based on significant contributions, such as the concept and design, or analysis and interpretation of the data. The inclusion of the names of authors whose contributions do not meet the abovementioned criteria cannot be justified, in which case they may appear in the Acknowledgments section.</p>
      <p>The <b>RGO</b> considers acceptable a maximum of 6 authors per article. However, a larger number may be accepted on an exceptional basis for papers that are more complex, which should be accompanied on a separate sheet of paper including a convincing justification for the participation of each of the authors.</p>
      <p>The identification page of the manuscripts should explicitly contain details of the contribution made by each author. </p>
      <p><b>Submission of the manuscript</b></p>
      <p>The text should be typed in Arial font size 12 with a line space of 1.5 cm. The paper should be A4 with left and top margins of 3 cm and bottom and right margins of 2 cm.</p>
      <p>All pages should be numbered starting from the identification page. For further clarification of potential formatting doubts, it is recommended that this volume is consulted.</p>
      <p>Articles should contain a maximum of 30 references, except in the case of review articles, which may have up to 50. Whenever a reference contains the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) number, this should be provided.</p>
      <p><b>Reformulated version:</b> the reformulated version should be sent via email, indicating the protocol and version numbers. The authors should send only the most up-to-date version of the work. The text of the article should use colored fonts (blue) for any alterations, together with a letter to the editor, repeating the interest in publishing in this Journal and advising which alterations to the manuscript have been made. If there is any disagreement as to the recommendations of the reviewers, the authors must submit the arguments that support their position. The title and code of the manuscript must be specified.</p>
      <p>The deadlines set for the resubmission of the corrected originals will be advised in the letter accompanying the originals and should be strictly adhered to.</p>
      <p>Resubmission after the stipulated deadline will result in the definitive cancelation of the process of evaluation and the definitive return of the originals.</p>
      <p>The elements of the text should be set out in the sequence shown below:</p>
      <p><b>Specialty or area of research</b>: one word only which will allow the reader to identify immediately the specialty or area to which the research study belongs.</p>
      <p><b>Title</b>: a) full title in both Portuguese and English or Spanish; it should be concise and avoid excessive wording, like &ldquo;evaluation of...&rdquo;, &ldquo;considerations concerning...&rdquo;, &ldquo;exploratory study&rdquo;; b) short title of up to 50 characters in Portuguese (or Spanish) and English.</p>
      <p><b>Authorship</b>: a) full name of all the authors, indicating the Department and/or Institution to which they belong (including an indication of the full addresses of all the universities with which the authors are connected); b) only one affiliation per author will be accepted. The authors should therefore choose from their affiliations the one they deem to be the most important; c) all affiliation data should be submitted in full, without abbreviation; d) full mailing address of all authors including contact name, telephone and email. NB: this should be the only part of the text that identifies the authors.</p>
      <p><b>Abstract</b>: a) all articles submitted in Portuguese or Spanish should contain an abstract in the original language and in English, with a minimum of 150 and maximum of 250 words. Articles submitted in English should be accompanied by an abstract in Portuguese, as well as the abstract in English; b) for original articles, abstracts should be structured by highlighting the objectives, basic methods employed, information on the study&rsquo;s location, population and sampling, results and the most significant conclusions, considering the objectives of the study and indicating how the study may be followed up. For the other categories, the abstract format should be in narrative form, but include the same information; c) it should not contain citations or abbreviations.</p>
      <p>Indexing terms: correspond to the words and expressions that identify the content of the article. Highlight a minimum of three and a maximum of six indexing terms, using the Health Sciences Descriptors (DeCS) created by BIREME, the virtual library of health sciences.</p>
      <p><b>Introduction</b> should be short and define the problem being studied, summarizing its importance and highlighting the gaps in knowledge which will be addressed in the article. It should contain an up-to-date review of the literature pertinent to the topic, adapted to the presentation of the problem, and which emphasizes its relevance. It should not be too extensive unless they are in manuscripts submitted as a Review Article.</p>
      <p><b>Methods</b> should be presented in detail sufficient to permit the observations to be corroborated, including the procedures employed, the population and sample; measurement tools and, where applicable, the validation method; statistical treatment. As far as the statistical analysis is concerned, the authors must demonstrate that the procedures used were not only appropriate for testing the hypotheses of the study but also that they have been correctly interpreted. The levels of statistical significance (e.g. p&lt;0.05; p&lt;0.01; p&lt;0.001) should be mentioned.</p>
      <p> Accurately identify all medication and chemical substances used, including generic names, doses and routes of administration. Scientific terms should be typed in full rather than their corresponding short form symbols. Included in this classification are: names of chemical compounds and elements and the binary combinations of microbiological, zoological and botanical nomenclature. The generic names of products are preferable to their respective commercial brand names, always followed (in parentheses) by the name of their manufacturer, the city and country where they were manufactured, separated by commas. </p>
      <p>State that the research study was approved by an Ethics Committee accredited by the Brazilian Health Council and supply the approval opinion number. When giving accounts of experiments using animals, note if the policies of institutional or national research councils or any national laws related to the care and use of laboratory animals were observed. </p>
      <p><b>Results</b> should be presented with the minimum possible discussion or personal interpretation, accompanied by tables and/or adequate illustrations, when necessary. Do not repeat in the text all the data already shown in the illustrations and tables. Statistical data should be submitted to appropriate analysis.</p>
      <p><b>Tables, charts, figures and graphs</b> should be limited to six in total and numbered consecutively and independently using Arabic numerals, according to the order in which the data are mentioned and should be shown on individual, separate sheets with an indication of their location in the text. Information on the place and year of the study is essential. Each should be given a brief title. Charts and tables should not display borders at the sides. Graphs should always be accompanied by the respective underlying numerical values, in Excel format.</p>
      <p>The authors shall take responsibility for the quality of the figures (drawings, illustrations, tables, charts and graphs), which should be capable of being reduced without loss of definition, for sizes with one or two columns (7 cm and 15 cm, respectively); landscape format is not permitted. Digitized figures should have a JPEG extension and a minimum resolution of 300 dpi. When displaying images and text, the use of a patient&rsquo;s initials, name and record number should be avoided. The patient may not be identified or be recognizable from the images. </p>
      <p><b>Discussion</b> should be restricted to the significance of the data obtained, avoiding hypotheses that are not founded on the results, and relate them to existing knowledge and to data obtained in other, important studies. Emphasize the novel and important aspects of the study and the conclusions arising therefrom. Do not repeat in detail the data or other material already cited in the Introduction or Results sections. Include implications for future studies.</p>
      <p><b>Conclusion</b>: final part of the paper based on available evidence which is pertinent to the object of the study. The conclusions should be precise and clearly set out, each one based on the objects of the study, listing the results obtained given the hypotheses raised. Demonstrate what was achieved by the study and the potential application of the results of the research study; further studies may be suggested that complement the research or address issues materializing during the course of the study. Bibliographical citations will not be accepted in this section.</p>
      <p><b>Acknowledgement</b>s should be listed in a paragraph consisting of a maximum of three lines, directed towards institutions or individuals which effectively contributed to the study.</p>
      <p><b>Appendices</b> should only be included when essential to an understanding of the text. It will be the responsibility of the editors to determine if their publication is necessary.</p>
      <p><b>Abbreviations and initials</b> should be used in a standardized form, being limited to only those conventionally used or sanctioned by use, accompanied by the full meaning when first cited in the text. They should not be used in the title or the abstract.</p>
      <p><b>References</b> should be consecutively numbered observing the order in which they are mentioned for the first time in the text, based on the Vancouver reference style. For references with up to six authors, all of them should be cited; for more than six authors, the first six should be cited, followed by the Latin expression et al. The titles of journals should be abbreviated according to the List of Journals Indexed in Index Medicus (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/serials/lji.html) and printed without the use of bold type, italics or underlines, the same presentation being used for all references.</p>
      <p>Citations or references to graduate course conclusion monographs, dissertations, theses and unpublished texts (classroom lessons, amongst others) will not be accepted. References to books should be kept to a minimum as they reflect the opinion of the respective authors and/or editors. Only references to the most recent books will be accepted. If an unpublished work written by one of the manuscript&rsquo;s authors is cited (i.e. an article in press), it will be necessary to include the acceptance letter of the journal that is to publish the article referred to.</p>
      <p>Bibliographical citations in the text: use the numerical citation system where only the index numbers of the references, in superscript format, are shown in the text. They should be placed in numerical order using Arabic numerals, half a line above and after the citation and should be included in the list of references. If there are two authors, both should be cited connected by a &quot;&amp;&quot;; if there are more than two, the first author is cited followed by the expression<em> et al.</em></p>
      <p>The accuracy and adequacy of the references to works which have been queried and mentioned in the text of the article are the responsibility of the author. All those authors whose works are cited in the text should be listed in the References section.</p>
