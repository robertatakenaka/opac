Since 1999, the Center of  Philosophy and Human Sciences and the Communication Center and Expression of  the Federal University of Santa Catarina hosts the journal. Currently, it is  incorporated to the Institute of Gender Studies, an organ that brings together  researchers from different disciplines [areas of knowledge and activity] of  UFSC, which have feminist studies and gender perspectives as common denominators.</p>

      <p>The different sections of the journal are composed of  articles (including a maximum of two translations), thematic articles, essays,  interviews, dossiers, thematic section, section debate and reviews.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>The articles</strong> will contain results analysis of empirical studies or will address  theoretical and methodological issues, obeying rules and criteria already  established by the academic culture.</p>
      <p>The<strong> Thematic Articles</strong> comprise a set of  articles already evaluated and accepted for publication that are coincidentally  related to the same subject. One or more publishers and/or universities are  invited to organize and present them according to their research interests and  familiarity with the subject in the articles already approved by ad hoc  reviewers  [referees]. Articles should be  of academic-scientific nature, resulting of empirical or theoretical research  that contributes to the field of feminist studies and/or gender.</p>
      <p>The <strong>Point of View</strong> section consists of essays  and interviews. The <strong>Essays</strong> derive from   reflections on a particular topic, presented in a more flexible and open  manner. The <strong>Interviews</strong>, which will be published in a format compatible  with its publication, may be performed either by the journal’s board, scholars,  politically engaged people or other professionals whose contribution are  relevant to the development of the subject. </p>
      <p>The <strong>Thematic Section</strong> results from a proposal of  an organizer, that can be external of a member of the journal’s board, that  would call for the production of academic papers on feminist and gender  studies, for publication scheduled with the editorial board, which, like all  other articles published in this journal, should be submitted to the evaluation  of external reviewers. </p>
      <p>The <strong>Dossiers</strong> should contain articles on current  and controversial issues that contribute to the epistemological and political  debate in the field. It should be coordinated by a professional or  professionals with recognized expertise on the theme proposed for the section  and will be submitted for consideration of the dossiers’ editorial board and  also by the editorial coordination. The texts constitute a set of works on  topic associated with political and social movements, inside or outside  academy, selected and organized by the coordinator of the dossier. The work may  include, in addition to articles and essays, many other textual categories,  such as statements, descriptions, proposals, manifestos, case studies, in  short, without necessarily suiting the academic and scientific standards as it  is mostly focused  on politically engaged  organizations.</p>
      <p>The <strong>Debate</strong> section is dedicated to revisiting  or introducing a relevant topic in women’s studies or gender, through the  republication of a seminal or controversial article, followed by comments and  reviews by experts in the field. It is organized by the editors of the section,  which are responsible for their evaluation.</p>
      <p>The <strong>Reviews</strong> section will publish critical  comments, evaluated by the reviews’ editorial board, on relevant work in the  field published in Brazil in the last two years or abroad in the last four  years.</p>
      <p> <em>Revista Estudos Feministas</em> offers authors / authors the opportunity to present their  article for publication in English, provided the translation is done by a sworn  translator or by the team indicated by the journal.

      <p><strong>Initial  evaluation</strong> </p>
      <p>The texts undergo a preliminary examination, after  which they will be returned to the author with comments or sent directly to  external peers. This review is an initial assessment to see whether the text is  in accordance with the journal’s guidelines; whether is constitutes a unique  and innovative article that reflect the great theoretical, methodological,  disciplinary, interdisciplinary and geographic diversity of the national  research in this field; and whether an external evaluation is justified.  Considering the recent increase in the number of submissions, the goal of the  publishers is to complete this process of initial review and return to the  author as quickly as possible.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Peer review</strong> </p>
      <p>The texts are sent to two ad hoc expert reviewers on  the subject addressed by the author. If there is a disparity in opinions, a  third reviewer should be called to evaluate the article. If the differences are  not overcome, the editors should issue the final opinion.<br>
        The editorial board asks the ad hoc reviewers to  evaluate the text within 20 days. The expectation is to make a decision and  respond to the author within three to four months after the work is first  received. In all of the following cases, the author will receive back the text  with unidentified comments from the reviewers.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Conditional  acceptance</strong> </p>
      <p>If the external reviews are favorable, the text will  be accepted under the condition that the author adequately addresses the issues  raised by the reviewers. The article should be resubmitted in a maximum of 30  days, highlighting the changes made. When the author resends the text later, it  will be examined by the articles editor and, if necessary, by at least one of  the original ad hoc referees. This process is done to see if the suggested  modifications have been handled properly. If both reports are positive, the  manuscript will be accepted for publication.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Non-acceptance and  resubmission</strong> </p>
      <p>A text may be rejected after the initial evaluation,  or peer evaluation, and also after review and resubmission of the work within  the stipulated deadline. If ad hoc reviewers indicate the need for a  substantial revision, the work will be rejected. If the opinions of reviewers  are generally  favorable, but there is  the need for a substantial revision before the text is accepted, the work will  be returned to the author/s with the recommendation that it needs to be  modified and  resubmitted  after the issues raised by the reviewers is  resolved. In the case the paper is re-submitted, the author/s must inform in  the presentation letter that another version of the article has already been  reviewed by the journal.<br>
        The editorial  committee hopes that the authors recognize the importance of a rigorous review  process to ensure high academic quality. Although no system is infallible, the  editorial policy of <em>Revista Estudos  Feministas</em> aims to maintain the quality of a journal that is considered a  reference in the studies of gender and feminism in Brazil and Latin America. </p>
      <p><strong>Deadline  for publication</strong></p>
      <p>The period between the reception of the final  manuscript containing all the modifications required for acceptance and the  publication of the article may be of around two or three issues (i.e. eight  months to one year).<strong> </strong></p></td>

      <p><strong>How and where  to send</strong> </p>
      <p>All materials must be submitted electronically via the  website: http://www.periodicos.ufsc.br/index.php/ref through the SEER platform.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Documents for  online submission</strong></p>
      <p>For online submission of the manuscript it is  mandatory to fill out the following forms, which must be entered in the system  in the supplementary document field:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>checklist of requirements for submission;</li>
        <li>cover letter with declaration of originality of the text.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Guidelines for  preparing the text for blind review </strong></p>
      <p><em>Revista Estudos Feministas&rsquo;</em> policy is to  perform &ldquo;double-blind&rdquo; reviews, i.e., neither the name of the author (or  authors), nor the name of the peers should be revealed to each other. This is  essential to ensure thorough and in-depth opinions on the reported research.</p>
      <p>Therefore, when preparing the electronic submission of  materials for evaluation, the editorial board asks the author to take a few  minutes to check the text and, where appropriate, do the following:</p>
      <p> • omit your name and the institution on the title  page, headers and footers;<br>
        • delete any information that can identify you  inadvertently as &ldquo;as this author has described elsewhere (quote) ...&rdquo; or &ldquo;see  (quote) for further discussion ...&rdquo;; <br>
        • avoid a multiplicity of self-citations or citations  of the author&rsquo;s unpublished material (doctoral dissertations, etc.);<br>
        • delete thanks to colleagues or institutional affiliations  that can also facilitate the identification of the author;<br>
        • delete all references to previous presentations of  the work in draft form (at conferences or public seminars, etc.).<br>
      The editorial board understands that it is not  possible to remove conclusively everything that might lead to identification of  the author. Although, be careful to eliminate all recognizable sources,  avoiding therefore the identification by the reviewers on obvious authoring  indicators.<strong></strong></p></td>
