    <TD width="70%"><p>Manuscripts  for publication in <strong>Biota Neotropica</strong> are to be submitted EXCLUSIVELY through the  website <a href="http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/bn-scielo" target="_blank">http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/bn-scielo</a> and must be prepared in accordance with the instructions below. After  successful submission you will receive a confirmation email along with an ID  number for your paper.</p>
      <p>All  subsequent correspondence should be sent to the Managing Editor at <a href="mailto:ea@biotaneotropica.org.br">ea@biotaneotropica.org.br</a>. </p>
      <p>Since  <strong>Biota Neotropica</strong> established a partnership with <a href="http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_serial&pid=1676-0603&lng=pt&nrm=iso">SciELO</a>,  the publication fee charged is R$ 1000.00 (One Thousand Reais) for Brazilian  authors or US$ 400.00 (Four Hundred Dollars) for foreign authors, irrespective  of the number of pages published. Payment details will be sent to authors in  the final editorial stage of articles accepted for publication. There is no submission fees for the articles.</p>
      <p><strong>Biota Neotropica does not publish papers that include  description of new species of taxonomic groups which Nomenclatural Code  requires printed copies. Authors are responsible to check if the specific  requirements of the Nomenclatural Code of the organism they are working with.  If your taxonomic group does require printed copies of your publication you  should look for another journal to submit your paper.</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>Biota Neotropica</strong> publishes eight types of manuscript: editorial, point of view,  articles, thematic reviews, short communications, identification key,  inventories and taxonomic reviews. Only the Editorial is written by the  Editorial Board or by an invited researcher and is therefore subject to  different submission rules. </p>
      <p>Manuscripts  submitted under any category should be written entirely in English. </p>
      <p>The submitting author must provide an ORCID ID  (Open Researcher and Contributor ID, <a href="http://orcid.org/" target="_blank">http://orcid.org/</a>) at the time of submission by entering it in the user profile in the  submission system. We strongly encourage coauthors to do the same.</p>
      <p>The authors  are responsible for presenting the article in good scientific English, and it  is strongly recommended that the manuscript undergo a final revision by a  specialized proofreading company such as American Journal Experts/AJE, Nature  Publishing Group Language Editing, Edanz and/or other <a href="http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_serial&pid=1676-0603&lng=pt&nrm=iso">SciELO</a>-approved services.  Should the Editorial Board consider the level of English to be below journal  standards, the paper may be refused even after approval by the Area Editor. The  content of manuscripts accepted for publication, regardless of category, is the  sole responsibility of the author(s).</p>
      <p><strong>1  &ndash; Manuscript Category</strong><br>
        To  follow is a brief description of how the Editorial Board defines each  manuscript category</p>
      <p><strong>Editorial</strong><br>
        For  each issue of <strong>Biota Neotropica</strong>, the Editor-in-Chief may invite a researcher to  write an Editorial on relevant topics, from a scientific standpoint and in  terms of creating policies for the conservation and sustainable use of  biodiversity in the Neotropical region. Editorials should contain a maximum of  3000 words.</p>
      <p><strong>Points of View </strong><br>
        This  section acts as a forum for academic discussion of a relevant issue within the  scope of the journal, whereby the researcher will write a short,  thought-provoking, article expressing his/her viewpoint on the issue in  question. At the discretion of the Editorial Board, the journal may publish  responses or considerations of other researchers to stimulate discussion on the  issue. The content of manuscripts accepted for publication, regardless of  category, is the sole responsibility of the author(s).</p>
      <p><strong>Articles</strong><br>
        Articles are submitted spontaneously by their authors in the  System of Submission of the Journal at <a href="http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/bn-scielo">http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/bn-scielo</a>. The manuscript must bring new data, not published or submitted  to publication, in part or entirely, in other journals or books, and must be  results of research in characterization, conservation, restoration and  sustainable use of biodiversity in Neotropical region.  The manuscript is expected to discuss an issue of scientific interest within  the scope of the journal and include a review of the specialized literature, as  well as a discussion of articles recently published in the international  literature. The  content of manuscripts accepted for publication, regardless of category, is the  sole responsibility of the author(s).</p>
      <p><strong>Thematic Reviews</strong><br>
        Thematic  Reviews are also submitted spontaneously by their authors through the Journal  Submission System. The manuscript is expected to develop a scientific concept  or theme related to the scope of the journal, based on references that are  essential to understanding the subject of the reviews, and including the most  recent published articles on the issue. The  content of manuscripts accepted for publication, regardless of category, is the  sole responsibility of the author(s).</p>
      <p><strong>Short Communications</strong><br>
      These  are short articles submitted spontaneously by their authors. The manuscript  must contain new data, not previously published and/or submitted for  publication in part or in whole, in any other periodical or book, and be the  result of research on the characterization, conservation, restoration or  sustainable use of Neotropical biodiversity. The manuscript is expected to  briefly discuss a new component among the issues of scientific interest related  to the scope of <strong>Biota Neotropica</strong>, based on recently published articles. The  content of manuscripts accepted for publication, regardless of category, is the  sole responsibility of the author(s).</p>
      <p>  <strong>Papers that only report the occurrence of species in a  region where their presence would be expected, but have yet to be recorded, are  not published by Biota Neotropica</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>Identification Keys</strong><br>
      Identification  Keys are submitted spontaneously by their authors through the Journal  Submission System. The manuscript is expected to describe, to the fullest  extent possible, the taxonomic group characterized by the identification key.  It should be firmly based on the taxonomic literature regarding the group in  question. The content of manuscripts accepted for publication, regardless of  category, is the sole responsibility of the author(s).</p>
      <p><strong>Inventories</strong><br>
        Inventories  are submitted spontaneously by their authors through the Journal Submission  System. The manuscript should contain new data, not previously published and/or  submitted for publication in part or in whole, in any other periodical or book,  and be the result of research on the characterization, conservation,  restoration or sustainable use of Neotropical biodiversity. In addition to the  list of inventoried species, the manuscript should include the authors&rsquo;  selection criteria (assemblage, guild, locality etc.), the methodology used and  the geographic coordinates of the study area. It must be strongly based on the  best taxonomic literature available for the group, and must inform clearly the  institution where testimony specimens are deposited. The content of manuscripts  accepted for publication, regardless of category, is the sole responsibility of  the author(s).</p>
      <p><strong>Taxonomic Reviews</strong><br>
        Taxonomic  Reviews are submitted spontaneously by their authors through the Journal  Submission System. The manuscript should contain new data, not previously  published and/or submitted for publication in part or in whole, in any other  periodical or book, and be the result of research on the characterization,  conservation, restoration or sustainable use of Neotropical biodiversity. The  manuscript is expected to contain comprehensive information on the taxon under  review, elucidate the main taxonomic issues and justify the need to revise it.  The review should be based on the current and historical scientific literature  regarding the taxon in question, and must inform clearly the institution where  the testimony specimens are deposited. The content of manuscripts accepted for  publication, regardless of category, is the sole responsibility of the  author(s).</p>
      <p><strong>2 &ndash; Submission and Publishing</strong><br>
        After  the paper is submitted, manuscripts that meet the guidelines will be sent to  the Editor-in-Chief, who will forward them to the Area Editors, who in turn  will select at least two &ldquo;ad hoc&rdquo; reviewers. In order to minimize conflicts of  interest, the journal currently uses the &ldquo;double-blind&rdquo; mechanism, where  neither authors nor reviewers are identified. This is especially important  because the authors are also asked to choose researchers that they do NOT wish  to review their manuscript.</p>
      <p>The  Area Editors are responsible for the entire publishing phase of the manuscript,  sending feedback to authors and reformulated versions of the work to the  reviewers. Once all requirements and recommendations made by reviewers and the  Associate Editors are met, the manuscript is preliminarily accepted and  forwarded to the Chief Editor. It is up to the Editor-in-Chief, in common  agreement with the Editorial Board, to definitively accept the paper.</p>
      <p>The  Abstracts of accepted papers are revised by their authors and published online  in the current issue of <strong>Biota Neotropica</strong>. It is important that authors submit  the definitive version of their work (including test, tables and figures)  through the Submission System, incorporating the final alterations/corrections  requested by the reviewers and/or Area Editor, since this is the version that  will be sent to the Editor-in-Chief for publication. Care taken at this stage  significantly reduces the need for corrections/alterations to the article  proofs.</p>
      <p>Search  tools, as well as indexation services, use the words in the title and the  keywords to locate and classify an article. Therefore, the selection of  keywords ensures that the author&rsquo;s manuscript can be found by other authors  interested in the same issue, increasing the likelihood of using their results  and, consequently, of citations. The information available at <a href="http://www.editage.com/insights/why-do-journals-ask-for-keywords">http://www.editage.com/insights/why-do-journals-ask-for-keywords</a> is a good source for selecting keywords.</p>
      <p>Upon  submitting a manuscript to <strong>Biota Neotropica</strong>, the author(s) transfer(s)  copyright to the journal. In any subsequent use of parts of the text, figures  and tables, <strong>Biota Neotropica</strong> must be cited as the source. </p>
      <p><strong>3  &ndash; File formatting</strong><br>
        The  manuscripts should be sent in DOC format (MS-Word for Windows version 6.0 or  higher) using Times New Roman font size 10. Section titles must be in font size  12. Bold face, italics, underlines, subscripts and superscripts can be used  when pertinent, but excessive use of these resources should be avoided. In  special cases (see formulas below), the following fonts can be used: Courier  New, Symbol and Wingdings. Manuscripts can contain electronic links that the  author judges appropriate. These must be included using the resources available  in MS-Word.</p>
      <p>After  submission, the manuscripts sent to <strong>Biota Neotropica</strong> must be divided into a  file containing the entire text of the manuscript, including the main body of  the text (first page, abstract, introduction, materials, methods, results,  discussion, acknowledgements and references) and, if necesary, a file for  tables. Figures will be included separately and identified in the system. It is  essential that authors open the files they prepared for submission to carefully  check if the figures, graphs or tables are in the desired format.</p>
      <p><strong>Main  document</strong><br>
        A  single file (called Principal.doc) containing titles, abstracts and keywords  (these are also included in another stage of the submission), entire text of  the manuscript, references and tables. The co-authors and their respective  affiliations should NOT be included in this file, neither should it contain  figures, which must be included separately in the system, as described below.  The manuscript should use the following format:</p>
      <p><strong>Brief  and informative title</strong><br>
        Use  a capital letter in the first word and in accordance with pre-established  grammar or scientific rules.</p>
      <p><strong>Body  of the Manuscript</strong></p>
      <p><strong>a. Sections &ndash; must not be numbered</strong><br>
        Introduction<br>
        Material  and Methods<br>
        Results<br>
        Discussion<br>
        Acknowledgments<br>
        References</p>
      <p><strong>b.  Special cases</strong><br>
        At  the author&rsquo;s discretion, in the case of &ldquo;Short Communications<em>&rdquo;</em>, Results and Discussion can be  combined. Do not use footnotes, include the information directly in the text,  since it makes reading easier and reduces the number of electronic links to the  manuscript.<br>
        In  the case of the &quot;Inventories&quot; category, the list of species,  environments, descriptions, photos, etc. should be sent separately so that they  can be organized in accordance with specific formats. To facilitate the use of  search engines, such as XML, the Editorial Board will send the authors specific  instructions for formatting the list of species cited in the manuscript.<br>
        In  the &quot;Identification Keys&quot; category, the key itself should be sent  separately so that it can be adequately formatted. In the case of references to  material collected, the geographical coordinates of the collection area must be  included. Whenever possible, the coordinates should be in degrees, minutes and  seconds (for example, 24&deg;32&rsquo;75&rdquo; S and 53&deg;06'31&quot; W). In the case of  references to endangered species, specify only degrees and minutes.</p>
      <p><strong>c.  Numbering subtitles</strong><br>
        The  title of each section should be written without numbering, in boldface, with  only the first letter capitalized (Ex. <strong>Introduction</strong>, <strong>Materials and Methods</strong> etc.). Only  two levels of subtitles, below the title of each section, will be permitted.  Subtitles must be numbered in Arabic numerals followed by a period to help  identify their order in the final format of the manuscript. Ex. <strong>Material and Methods</strong>; 1. Subtitle; 1.1.  Sub-subtitle.</p>
      <p><strong>d.  Species names</strong><br>
        In  the case of species citations, they must comply with the respective  Nomenclature Codes. In the area of Zoology, all the species cited in the paper  must be followed by the author and date of the original publication of the  description, or by the author and/or revisor of the species in the case of  Botany. In the field of&nbsp; Microbiology  specific sources should be consulted, such as the International <a href="http://ijs.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem">Journal  of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>e.  References in the text</strong><br>
        Insert references in  accordance with the following standard:<br>
        Silva (1960) or (Silva 1960)<br>
        Silva (1960, 1973)<br>
        Silva (1960a, b)<br>
        Silva &amp; Pereira (1979) or (Silva  &amp; Pereira 1979)<br>
        Silva et al. (1990) or (Silva et al.  1990)<br>
        (Silva 1989, Pereira &amp; Carvalho  1993, Ara&uacute;jo et al. 1996, Lima 1997)</p>
      <p><strong>Biota Neotropica</strong> does not accept references to unpublished data that are inaccessible  to the reviewers or readers. In taxonomic studies, include citations of the  material examined in accordance with the specific rules of the type of organism  under study.</p>
      <p><strong>f.  Numbers and units</strong><br>
        Present numbers and units  as follows:<br>
        - numbers up to nine should  be spelled out, unless they are followed by units;<br>
        -use a period for the  decimal number (10.5 m);<br>
        -use the International  System of Units, separating the value units by a space (except for percentages,  degrees, minutes and seconds);<br>
        -use unit abbreviations  whenever possible. Do not use spaces to change lines if the unit does not fit  on the same line.</p>
      <p><strong>g.  Formulas</strong><br>
        Formulas  that can be written on a single line, even if it requires the use of special  fonts (<em>Symbol, Courier New and Wingdings</em>),  can be included in the text. Ex. a = p.r2 or Na2HPO, etc. Any other type of  formula or equation will be considered a figure and must therefore follow the  rules established for figures.</p>
      <p><strong>h.  Figure and Table citations</strong><br>
        Write words in full (Ex.  Figure 1, Table 1)</p>
      <p><strong>i.  References</strong><br>

      <p>All  papers published in <strong>Biota Neotropica</strong> have an individual electronic address,  which appears on the top left area of the PDF, as well as a DOI identification  number. Therefore, to reference papers published in <strong>Biota Neotropica</strong>&nbsp; follow the example below:</p>
      <p>SANTOS,  R.M., SCHLINDWEIN, M.N., VIVIANI, V.R. Survey of Bioluminescent Coleoptera in  the Atlantic Rain Forest of Serra da Paranapiacaba in S&atilde;o Paulo State (Brazil).  Biota Neotropica. 16(1):  e0045. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1676-0611-BN-2015-0045">http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1676-0611-BN-2015-0045</a> (last access on dd/mm/yyyy)</p>
      <p><strong>j.  Tables</strong><br>
        Tables can be inserted  directly into MS Excel software, but must be saved in spreadsheet, not workbook  format.<br>
        Tables must be numbered  sequentially with Arabic numerals.<br>
        The  legend should be included in this file, contained in a single paragraph, and  identified by starting the paragraph with Table N, where N is the number of the  table.</p>
      <p><strong>k. Figures</strong><br>
      Maps,  photos and graphs are considered figures. Figures should be numbered  sequentially using Arabic numerals.</p>
      <p> In  the case of drawings, the texts contained in the figures should use sans-serif  fonts, such as <em>Arial or Helvetica</em>,  for better legibility. Figures composed of several others should be identified  by letters (Ex. Figure 1a, Figure 1b). Use a scale bar to indicate size.  Figures should not contain legends; these must be included in their own file.</p>
      <p> Figure  legends should be part of the Principal.rtf or Principal.doc text file, and  included after the references. Each legend should be contained in a single  paragraph and be identified, starting the paragraph with Figure N, where N is  the number of the figure. Compound figures can or not have independent legends.</p>
      <p><strong>4 - Authorship</strong><br>
        After acknowledgements, create the item  Authors' Contributions, containing information about the contribution of each  of the authors, which should be described using one of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Substantial contribution in the concept and  design of the study;</li>
        <li>Contribution to data collection</li>
        <li>Contribution to data analysis and  interpretation</li>
        <li>Contribution to manuscript preparation</li>
        <li>Contribution to critical revision, adding  intelectual content </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The contributions of each co-author be included in the  system in order to appear as a note in the published manuscript.</p>
      <p>          <strong>5 &ndash; Conflicts of  interest</strong> <br>
      <strong>Biota Neotropica</strong> requires all authors to explain any potential sources of conflict of  interest. Any interest or relationship, financial or otherwise, that could  potentially influence the author&rsquo;s objectivity, is considered a potential  source of conflict of interest. These must be revealed when they are either  directly or indirectly related to the manuscript submitted to the journal. The  existence of a conflict of interest does not impede publication in this  journal, provided that it is clearly explained by the authors in a footnote or  in the acknowledgements. </p>
      <p> The corresponding author is responsible  for informing all the authors regarding this policy and ensuring that they  comply with this guideline.</p>
      <p> If the authors have no conflict of  interest to declare, they must state the following: &ldquo;The author(s) declare(s)  that they have no conflict of interest related to the publication of this  manuscript&rdquo;.</p>
      <p><strong>6 - Ethics</strong> <br>
  <strong>Biota Neotropica</strong> is confident that the authors  who submit manuscripts have complied with the guidelines established by the  ethics committees of their respective research institutions. Studies involving  human beings and/or clinical trials must be approved by the Institutional  Committee that assesses this type of research. This approval, as well as  information on the nature of this Committee, should be included in the  Materials and Methods section. In the case of human subjects, it is essential  to include a declaration that prior informed consent was obtained from all the  participants, or a declaration stating why this was not necessary.</p>
      <p><strong>Biota Neotropica</strong> uses CrossCheck to identify any sort of plagiarism, double submissions, already published articles and possible frauds in research.</p>
    <p><strong>7 &ndash;  Publication frequency</strong><br>
          <em><strong>Biota Neotropica</strong> is a quarterly  journal that publishes 4 issues a year. The online publication is continuous  and the paper is published as soon as the authors aprove the final document. An  issue is</em> finalized every three months and as such, papers approved  by March 31 will be published in issue 1, by June 30 in issue 2, by September  30 in issue 3 and by December 31 in issue 4.
