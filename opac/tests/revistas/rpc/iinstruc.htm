(Literature Review: consulted  databases, number of articles found, number of articles included, inclusion and  exclusion criteria, meta-analysis or descriptive work; Original article: study  design, number of subjects included, study duration, etc.), 3. What are the key  findings?, 4. What significance do your results have for the field and for the  broader community?</p>
      Upon receipt, manuscripts are primarily evaluated by the Journal Editor  and/or Assistant Editors for their originality, validity, and importance of  content and conclusions.
