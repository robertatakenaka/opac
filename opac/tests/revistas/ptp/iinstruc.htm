      <p><b>Types of articles accepted for reviewing by the Journal</b></p>

      <p>The journal <i>Psicologia: Teoria e Pesquisa</i> publishes original articles 

        related to the diverse areas of Psychology and adopts the publication 

        norms of the sixth edition of the publication manual of the American Psychological 

        Association (APA, 2010). The authors who pretend to submit manuscripts 

        to Psicologia: Teoria e Pesquisa should strictly follow the norms described 

        in the APA manual.</p>

      <p>In accordance with the norms of the APA, the journal <i>Psicologia: Teoria 

        e Pesquisa</i> accepts manuscripts that fit in one of the following categories: 

      </p>

      <p>1. <b>Empirical Studies:</b> Reports of original research with primary 

        or secondary data sources. They typically consist of distinct sections 

        that reflect the stages in the research process and that appear in the 

        following sequence: introduction (development of the problem under investigation, 

        including its historical antecedents, and statement of the purpose of 

        the investigation); method (description of the participants, instruments, 

        materials/equipments and procedures used to conduct the investigation); 

        results (report of the findings and analyses); and discussion (summary, 

        interpretation, and implication of the results). This type of article 

        is limited to 30 pages, including abstract, <i>resumo</i>, figures, tables, 

        and references. The abstract and the <i>resumo</i> have each a word limit 

        of 120 words. </p>

      <p>2. <b>Literature Reviews:</b> Critical evaluations of material that has 

        already been published. In this category also are included research syntheses 

        and meta-analyses. The purpose of this type of article is that the authors 

        integrate, and evaluate previously published material considering the 

        progress of research toward clarifying a problem. The authors are expected 

        to: (a) define and clarify the problem; (b) summarize previous investigations 

        to inform the reader of the state of research; (c) identify relations, 

        contradictions, gaps, and inconsistencies in the literature; and (d) suggest 

        the next step or steps in solving the problem. There is no predefined 

        structure for this type of article, so the authors have to find a coherent 

        format for their text. It is fundamental that the text has an organizing 

        principle: it should not be a mere compilation of previous investigations. 

        This type of article is limited to 30 pages, including abstract, <i>resumo</i>, 

        figures, tables, and references. The abstract and the <i>resumo</i> have 

        each a word limit of 120 words.</p>

      <p>3. <b>Theoretical Articles:</b> In theoretical articles, authors draw 

        on existing research literature to advance theory. Authors of theoretical 

        articles are expected to trace the development of theory to expand and 

        refine theoretical constructs or present a new theory or analyze existing 

        theory, pointing out flaws or demonstrating the advantage of one theory 

        over another. In this type of article, authors customarily examine a theory's 

        internal consistency and external validity. The sections of a theoretical 

        article, like those of a literature review, can vary in order of their 

        content. It is fundamental that there is a propositional element in the 

        text. This type of contribution is limited to 30 pages including abstract, 

        <i>resumo</i>, figures, tables, and references. The abstract and the <i>resumo</i> 

        have each a word limit of 120 words.</p>

      <p>4. <b>Methodological Articles:</b> This type of contribution present 

        new methodological approaches, modifications of existing methods, or discussions 

        of quantitative and data analytic approaches to the community of researchers. 

        In this case, the use of empirical data serves only as an illustration 

        of the approach. This type of contribution is limited to 21 pages including 

        abstract, <i>resumo</i>, figures, tables, and references. The abstract 

        and the <i>resumo</i> have each a word limit of 120 words. </p>

      <p>After consulting with the editor the following categories of contributions 

        will also be appreciated for publication: </p>

      <p>5. <b>Case Studies:</b> This type of contribution contains an analysis 

        of conceptual implications or a description of an intervention procedure 

        or intervention strategy. The inclusion is required of appropriate methodological 

        evidence of interest for the performance of psychologists of the diverse 

        areas. This type of contribution is limited to 21 pages including abstract, 

        <i>resumo</i>, figures, tables, and references. The abstract and the <i>resumo</i> 

        have each a word limit of 80 words. </p>

      <p>6.<b> Brief Report:</b> This contribution is a brief but complete report 

        of a specific research study (see the general model defined for empirical 

        studies). This type of contribution is limited to 12 pages including abstract, 

        <i>resumo</i>, figures, tables, and references. The abstract and the <i>resumo</i> 

        have each a word limit of 80 words.</p>

      <p>7.<b> Letter to the Editor:</b> A critical evaluation of an article published 

        in the journal <i>Psicologia: Teoria e Pesquisa </i>or a reply of authors 

        to a criticism of their article. This type of contribution is limited 

        to 6 pages. No abstract required.</p>

      <p>8.<b> Technical Note:</b> A description of original research instruments 

        and techniques. This type of contribution is limited to 9 pages including 

        abstract, <i>resumo</i>, figures, tables, and references. The abstract 

        and the <i>resumo</i> have each a word limit of 60 words. </p>

      <p>9.<b> Book Review:</b> A critical review of a recent published book which 

        provides an orientation to the reader about its characteristics and its 

        potential use. It is fundamental that this is not merely a summary or 

        review of the chapters of the book, but essentially a critical review. 

        This type of contribution is limited to 6 pages, including all its elements. 

        No abstract required.</p>

      <p>10.<b> Inform:</b> Publication of a fact or an event related to Psychology. 

        In this case the contribution does not need to be original and exclusive. 

        This type of contribution is limited to 3 pages, including all its elements. 

        No abstract required.</p>

      <p><b>The process of reviewing by the Editorial Board</b></p>

      <p>Manuscripts that fit in one of the 10 above described categories are 

        accepted for the reviewing process on condition that: (a) the same contribution 

        was not already published nor is being submitted to another journal for 

        publication; (b) all persons listed as authors approve the submission 

        of the manuscript to the journal <i>Psicologia: Teoria e Pesquisa</i>; 

        (c) anyone mentioned as a source of a personal communication has approved 

        the citation; (d) the authors have followed all ethical procedures recommended 

        by the standards adopted by the journal. </p>

      <p>The first evaluation of the manuscript is accomplished by the Direction 

        of the journal <i>Psicologia: Teoria e Pesquisa</i> and consists of a 

        thorough analysis whether the manuscript is in accordance with the APA 

        norms, considering especially the following two aspects: the type of contribution 

        (their main characteristics, defined in this document and in the APA manual) 

        and the norms of the APA manual regarding redaction and formatting. The 

        reviewing process will be interrupted in case a manuscript is considered 

        not to have followed the APA norms: the authors will be informed of this 

        decision. </p>

      <p>In case the manuscript is in accordance with the APA norms it will be 

        sent for reviewing to the Editorial Board that can make use of ad hoc 

        reviewers. The authors will be notified of the acceptance or rejection 

        of their manuscripts.</p>

      <p>Small modifications in the manuscript can be made by the Direction or 

        by the Editorial Board of the journal. When substantial modifications 

        are necessary the author will be notified. In this case the author has 

        to realize the necessary modifications and has to return the modified 

        manuscript before the informed deadline.</p>

      <p><b>Presentation form of the manuscripts</b></p>

      <p>The journal <i>Psicologia: Teoria e Pesquisa </i>adopts integrally the 

        publication norms of the publication manual of the American Psychological 

        Association (6<sup>th</sup> edition, 2010). The manuscripts should be 

        written in Portuguese, English or Spanish, or in another language to the 

        judgment of the Editorial Board.</p>

      <p>The submission of all manuscripts should be realized electronically using 

        the SEER platform with the following internet address: <a href="http://www.revistaptp.unb.br" target="_blank">www.revistaptp.unb.br</a>.</p>

      <p>When submitting the manuscript the authors have to make an upload in 

        the journal's system of two files in a WORD 2003 or more recent format. 

        The first file is the manuscript, without any type of the authors' identification 

        and containing all necessary elements: title, abbreviated title, <i>resumo</i> 

        (if written in Portuguese <i>Resumo</i>, and if written in Spanish <i>R&eacute;sumen</i>), 

        abstract, text, references, tables (one on each page) and figures (one 

        on each page). The second file is a cover letter that should contain all 

        of the necessary elements indicated in the APA manual, signed by all the 

        authors of the manuscript. Only if strictly essential for the evaluation 

        of the manuscript additional files should be sent.</p>

      <p>The presentation of numeric and statistical information should strictly 

        follow the recommendations of the APA manual. Manuscripts written in Portuguese 

        should adopt the normalization of numeric and statistical information 

        according to recommendations of Carzola, Silva and Vendramini (2009), 

        which can be accessed for free at the following electronic address:<br>

        <a href="http://www.ip.usp.br/portal/images/stories/biblioteca/Publicar-in-Psicologia.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.ip.usp.br/portal/images/stories/biblioteca/Publicar-in-Psicologia.pdf</a>. 

      </p>

      <p>It should be mentioned that, in case of articles written in Portuguese, 

        eventual inconsistencies between the guidelines of the APA manual and 

        the redaction in Portuguese should be resolved by the authors considering 

        the general redaction rules of the Portuguese language. The formatting 

        of the manuscript and the elaboration of tables, figures and other elements 

        should proceed strictly according to the recommendations of the APA manual. 

        We recommend strongly that authors evaluate, before submission, whether 

        their manuscript is in agreement with the check-list presented on pages 

        241-243 of the APA manual. It should be noted that not following the APA 

        guidelines in formatting the aforementioned elements can be a motive for 

        rejection of the manuscript by the Direction of the Journal. As a complementary 

        source for authors of information about the APA publication manual the 

        consultation of the following addresses is recommended: </p>
