      <p>Evaluation by peer reviewers<br>
    All articles published are commented on by outside consultants. Whenever  possible, the decision whether or not to accept an article for publication will  be made within two months as of the date of its receipt. The evaluation of the  article is sent to the authors, but the consultants themselves remain  anonymous. The Editorial Committee reserves the right to introduce any changes  needed to adapt the texts to the journal's editorial possibilities.

    <p><strong>1 Objective</strong></p>
    <p>The Latin American Journal of Fundamental  Psychopathology is a four-monthly official vehicle of the University  Association of Research in Fundamental Psychopathology; its purpose is to  disseminate scientific works that may contribute to the advancement of  knowledge about the treatment and prevention of psychic suffering (pathos). The  journal gives priority to the publication of articles and essays resulting from  research using the clinical method, that is, based on clinical cases presenting  obscure and enigmatic aspects.</p>
    <p><strong>2 Peer Review  Process</strong></p>
    <p>In the article peer review process for  publication, the originality, the relevance of the theme and the quality of the  scientific methodology used in the article will be evaluated, in addition to  the editorial norms adopted by the journal. Articles about analysis of books or  movie characters will not be accepted. Undergraduate, masters or doctoral  students may submit their articles for publication, giving preference to those  written in co-authorship with their advisors.</p>

Abstracts should identify objectives, procedures and  conclusions of the work and should be written very carefully, as they guide the  reader to decide whether to read the article or not. Abstracts should contain a  maximum of seven lines or 490 characters with space, and be clear and precise,  revealing the general content of the article and the main conclusions. The  abstract is an independent text of the article. It should be written at the end,  after the final version of the article is done.<br>
      <strong>Descriptors: </strong>The descriptors or keywords should be four (4) expressions that  represent the subject treated in the work, and should be provided by the author  in Chinese (Mandarin), German, Spanish, French, English and Portuguese.<br>

      <strong>Footnotes: </strong>These are non-bibliographical notes placed at the foot of the pages.  Footnotes should be reduced to a minimum and be ordered by Arabic numerals  appearing immediately after the text segment to which the footnote refers.<br>
      The bibliographic notes should follow the  author/date system, and include the page in parentheses after the citation.<br>
  <strong>Acknowledgments: </strong>The acknowledgments should  be brief, direct and directed only to people or institutions that have  contributed substantially to the preparation of the paper and should come  before the bibliographic references.<br>
  <strong>References</strong>: References and citations should follow the American Psychological  Association (APA) style and appear at the end of the article, in alphabetical  order by surname. Authors should make sure that the references cited in the  text are included in the list of references with exact dates and correctly  spelled authors' names. The accuracy of these references is responsibility of  the authors. Personal communications, unpublished or ongoing work may be cited  when absolutely necessary, and should not be included in the list of references  –only in the text or footnotes-.<br>
      If the list of references does not follow the  adopted style, works can be rejected, without revision of content.<br>
  <strong>6.6.3 Tables</strong><br>

      <p>Procedures for processing manuscripts:<br>
As soon the journal receives a manuscript, it is sent to an outside  consultant for comments, accompanied by a letter and the guideline presented  below. The comments are then sent to the authors to make the suggested changes.<br>
<strong><em>Revista Latinoamericana de Psicopatologia  Fundamental</em></strong>&nbsp;uses the  system of evaluation of articles by anonymous outside consultants, following  the policy adopted by the S&atilde;o Paulo State Research Support Foundation (Fapesp).  Consultants have access to the names of the authors, but the names of the  outside consultants for articles submitted for publication are confidential.  Once a year, the journal publishes a complete list of outside consultants who  have commented on the texts published in the volume.<br>
Letter to outside consultant:<br>
Professor (name)&nbsp;<br>
Address:&nbsp;<br>
Dear Dr......:<br>
I am sending you the enclosed article, entitled............, for your  analysis, detailed comments and opinion. This text has been received for  publication in&nbsp;<strong><em>Revista  Latinoamericana de Psicopatologia Fundamental</em></strong>.<br>
The comments and opinion should be presented in the attached form and  returned within four weeks.Should  you not be able to meet this deadline, please inform us as soon as possible.
      <p>shown on it should be explicitly treated in your opinion.<br>
      Considering the great number of articles received by the journal and the  constant concern for a standard of excellence, I would ask that you make your  opinion as strict as possible. I would also ask for your special attention to  the importance and relevance of the article, since this journal concerns  Fundamental Psychopathology and not psychoanalysis, psychology, psychiatry or  any such field. The question of mental suffering should therefore be present,  although interfaces among different areas dedicated to this issue are  considered important. The journal gives special attention to articles based on  the clinical method. Texts consisting of bibliographic reviews and disclosure  are generally not considered appropriate for this publication.<br>
      If for any reason you are not able to issue an opinion, we would  appreciate receiving suggestions as to the name and address of some other ad  hoc consultant for this respective article.<br>
      The names of outside consultants for&nbsp;<strong><em>Revista Latinoamericana de Psicopatologia  Fundamental</em></strong>&nbsp;are kept  completely confidential.<br>
      Thank you for your participation and cooperation.</p>
