      <p> <em>Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria  is the official  journal of the Brazilian Academy of Neurology.</em> The mission of the  journal is to provide neurologists, specialists and  researchers in Neurology and related fields with open access to original articles (clinical  and translational research), 

      editorials, reviews,   historical papers, neuroimages and letters about published manuscripts. It  also publishes the consensus and guidelines on Neurology, as well as  educational and scientific material from the different scientific departments  of the Brazilian Academy of Neurology.      
      <p>The  ultimate goals of the journal are to contribute to advance knowledge in the  areas of Neurology and Neuroscience, and to provide valuable material for  training and continuing education for neurologists and other health  professionals working in the area. These goals might contribute to improving  care for patients with neurological diseases. We aim to be the best  Neuroscience journal in Latin America within the peer review system.            
      <p> <i>Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria</i> publishes one volume per year, consisting 

        of twelve monthly issues, from January to December, in two versions:</p>
