      <p>Articles for publication should be sent exclusively to  <strong>Revista Ga&uacute;cha de Enfermagem</strong> (RGE), and their reproduction in other  publications is permitted by means of authorization by the Editorial Board; in  this case the original publication should be cited.       
      <p>In RGE, articles written by specialists in other  fields may be published, provided the subject is of interest to the nursing  field. </p>
      <p>One does not need to subscribe to the journal to  submit a manuscript. However, fees for submission must be paid (when submitting  the article; this fee will not be refunded to authors should the manuscript be  archived or refused); and fees for publication (upon acceptance of the  manuscript for publication). </p>
      <p>The online journal is an open and free access.</p>
      <p>The  <strong>Revista Ga&uacute;cha de Enfermagem</strong> adopts the peer-review system, omitting the names  of the authors and advisors when assessing the content and the  technical-scientific quality of the manuscript.</p>
      <p>The  assessment process of an article for RGE comprises the following steps:  pre-assessment, referral and assessment monitoring, evaluation by the  reviewers, reformulations of the manuscript by the authors, evaluation of the  CED and communication of the decision to the authors</p>
      <p>The  manuscript, once submitted to RGE through the online process, undergoes the  pre-assessment process co-ordinated by the Assistant Editor, which evaluates  the compliance with the standards of publication, the relevance of the article,  as well as basic aspects of the method and scientific writing.</p>
      <p>The  articles that meet the Journal's standards will be assessed by the two consultants  with regard to merit, originality, relevance of content, academic quality,  publication convenience, along with their relevance to nursing and related  fields.</p>
      <p>The  Section Editor will select two <em>ad hoc </em>reviewers who are experts in the  thematic and in the method of the article under assessment and will send the  manuscript for evaluation by means of a specific form.</p>
      <p>The  opinions of the consultants shall be taken into consideration by the Section  Editor, who forwards them to the authors when the opinions suggest  reformulations, or to the CED when the opinions suggest rejection of the  manuscript.</p>
      <p>The  CED, based on the opinions of the <em>ad hoc </em>reviewers, evaluates the  manuscript and decides on its acceptance, referring the authors for new  reformulations, or on its refusal of publication. The CED is the forum that  decides on the publication or not of the manuscript. The manuscripts are  therefore accepted, reformulated, or rejected. The author is notified about any  of these possibilities.</p>
      <p>Upon designation for publication, the manuscript  should be transcribed for translation into English, the service fee for which  should be agreed upon with the translation firm recommended by RGE. </p>
      <p>Manuscripts may be submitted in Portuguese, Spanish or  English. </p>
      <p>Articles may only be submitted online, via the  website: <a href="https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/rgenf-scielo" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=pt-BR&q=https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/rgenf-scielo&source=gmail&ust=1478021492973000&usg=AFQjCNF7JJIMgfWpE3kgp9h146gDg-kHLA">https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/rgenf-scielo</a></p>
      <p>At the time of submission, each author's full name,  institution of origin, country, email and summarized biography i.e. full names  of parents and credentials) should only be included in the metadata.  Acknowledgments of financial, technical and other assistance relied on to carry  out the work should not be mentioned at the time of submission. Only after the  work is accepted will this information be inserted, after the references. </p>
      <p>Authors of work submitted for evaluation should send a  Declaration of Responsibility and Transference of Copyright, drawn up according  to this journal's model (<a href="/revistas/rgenf/model.pdf" target="_blank">Modelo de Declara&ccedil;&atilde;o de Responsabilidade</a>), signed by all authors, and sent  along with the article as supplementary documentation. </p>
      <p>In manuscripts resulting from studies involving human  beings, authors should indicate the procedures adopted to comply with the  determinations of Resolution no. 466, December 12, 2012, by the Brazilian Board  of Health (or Resolution 196/96) four studies prior to June 2013), as well as  the approval protocol number for the research project in the text body. A copy  of the protocol should be sent to RGE as supplementary documentation. </p>
      <p><strong>Conflicts of interest </strong>may  arise when authors, reviewers or editors have interest that, even though they  may not be completely apparent, can influence their judgments about what is  published. Conflicts of interest can be of a personal, commercial, political,  academic or financial nature. When authors submit a manuscript, they are  responsible for recognizing and revealing conflicts of interest that may  influence the content of work submitted to RGE.</p>
      <p>One does not need to subscribe to the journal to submit a manuscript. However, fees for submission must be paid in the amount of R$ 150,00 (when submitting the article; this fee will not be refunded to authors should the manuscript be archived or refused); and fees for publication in the amount of R$ 700,00 (upon acceptance of the manuscript for publication).</p>
      <p>The control for plagiarism identification RGE takes from the expertise of the peer, peer-reviewers, selected by the editors for evaluation of the articles.<br>

      <p>Writing should be clear and concise, with precise  expression of objectives. Arguments should be founded on well justified  evidence. </p>
      <p>When preparing manuscripts, it is recommendable to  search for and cite articles that are pertinent to the theme previously  published in national and international scientific literature, facilitating  contextualization, coherence and continuity for readers. </p>
      <p>The journal is not responsible for grammatical errors  and therefore reserves the right to decide on alterations and corrections. </p>
      <p>Articles should be submitted in Windows Word format,  Times New Roman 12, double spaced (including the abstracts), with all pages  numbered, configured on A4 sized paper and with 2.5 cm margins. When articles  are written in Portuguese, they should obey the Spelling Agreement of 1990,  approved on December 29, 2008. </p>
      <p>Titles of text sections should be emphasized by  gradation, without being numbered. The title of the article and abstract should  be uppercase and bold (ex.: <strong>TITLE;  ABSTRACT</strong>); resumo and resumen, in uppercase, bold and italics (ex.:<strong><em>RESUMO;  RESUMEN</em></strong>); first sections in uppercase and bold (ex.:<strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>); and secondary sections  in lowercase and bold (ex.: <strong>History</strong>).  Avoid using markers throughout the text (example: -,*, etc.], and avoid  sub-items as well [a), b), c)...]. </p>
      <p>Original articles, systematic reviews and integrated  reviews should be no more than 20 pages long, while theoretical reflective  articles should be no longer than 10 pages long, equivalent to 4500-5000 and  2500 words, respectively. </p>
      <p>The journal contains the following sections: </p>
      <p><strong>Editorial</strong>: These texts are the responsibility of the journal's  Editorial Board (CDC), which can invite authorities to write them. Editorials should be no  longer than 500 words long; </p>
      <p><strong>Original  articles: </strong>These contributions are  meant to promote original, previously unpublished research. They should be  structured as follows: the introduction should present the guiding question,  justification, review of the literature (pertinent and relevant) and objectives  coherent with the proposal of the study. The methods employed, population  studied, source of data and selection criteria should be described in an  objective and complete manner. The results should be described in logical  order. When presenting tables and illustrations, accompanying text should  complement, not repeat what is described in them. The discussion, which should  be written along with the results, should contain comparisons to results in the  literature and interpretations by the author(s). Conclusions and final  considerations should highlight the most important findings, comment on  limitations and implications for new research. <strong>Articles should obey the limit of 20 total pages (including title,  abstracts, keywords, text body, illustrations and no more than 20 references).</strong><strong> </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Systematic  review articles</strong>: these are  contributions whose research method is conducted by way of synthesizing the  results of original quantitative studies, with the goal of responding to a  specific question that is of relevance to nursing or health care.  Methodological procedures should be described in detail in all of its stages  regarding the search for original studies, criteria for inclusion and  exclusion, preliminary test and levels of evidence, following the adopted  theoretical and methodological references. Systematic reviews can be  characterized as meta-analysis and/or meta-synthesis, depending on the type of  methodological approach of the manuscript and study objective.<strong> Articles should obey the limit of 20 total  pages (including title, abstracts, keywords, text body, illustrations and no  more than 20 references).</strong><strong> </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Integrative  review articles</strong>: these our  contributions that use a research method guidance through synthesis and  comparison of the results of research that is quantitative, original  qualitative and critically supported theoretical reflections. Their goal is to  respond to specific guiding questions, which express the state-of-the-art  and/or gaps in knowledge regarding relevant phenomena to nursing and/or health  care.&nbsp; Methodological procedures should  be detailed in all stages as called for by the primary references adopted (for  example: Cooper, Ganon, Whittmore and Knalf, Brome, among others), which  confers scientific credence to the study.<strong> These are not literature review articles.&nbsp;  Articles should obey the limit of 20 total pages (including title,  abstracts, keywords, text body, illustrations and no more than 20 references).</strong><strong> </strong></p>
      <p><strong>Reflective  articles: </strong>these are discursive  formulations of a theoretical effect with a theoretical philosophical  foundation regarding the global scenario in which a determined investigative or  potentially investigative subject is found. <strong>Articles should obey the limit of 10 total pages (including title,  abstracts, keywords, text body, illustrations and no more than 15 references)</strong>. </p>
      <p>Manuscripts should contain: </p>
      <p><strong>Title: </strong>which should be  coherent with the objectives of the study and identify content in up to 15  words; </p>
      <p><strong>Abstract: </strong>the first abstract  should be presented in the language of the manuscript, contain up to 150 words  and be accompanied by its translation to Portuguese (<em>Resumo</em>) and Spanish (<em>Resumen</em>). </p>
      <p>It should be  drawn up obeying the <strong>structured abstract format</strong>,  with the following items:&nbsp; </p>
      <p><strong>Objectives:&nbsp;</strong>(guiding  questions of the research)&nbsp; <br>
        <strong>Methods:</strong>&nbsp;(type of study,  sample, period and place of research, data collection, data analysis) <br>
        <strong>Results:&nbsp;</strong>(main findings  with statistic data, if appropriate) <br>
        <strong>Conclusions:</strong>&nbsp;(responses  to objectives based on results) </p>
      <p>With theoretical reflective articles, the description  of methodology may be omitted. </p>
      <p><strong>Keywords: </strong>at the end of the  Abstract, indicate three to six words to identify the subject of the  manuscript, in English; and their respective translations into Portuguese (<em>Palavras Chaves</em>) and Spanish (<em>Palabras clave</em>), according to &ldquo;<em>Descritores em Ci&ecirc;ncias da Sa&uacute;de</em> &ndash; DeCS&rdquo;  (in Portuguese at <a href="http://decs.bvs.br" target="_blank">http://decs.bvs.br</a>), RGE may modify them if necessary. </p>
      <p><strong>Title  in other languages: </strong>indicate  the title in Portuguese (<em>t&iacute;tulo</em>) and  Spanish (<em>t&iacute;tulo</em>), right after that  language's keywords. </p>
      <p><strong>Introduction</strong>: this should present the research problem,  justification, review of literature (pertinent and relevant), the guiding  question of the research and objectives coherent with the proposed research. </p>
      <p><strong>Methodology  or Methods or Materials and Methods:</strong> this should present the method employed: type of  study; theoretical references for the study and those used for data analysis,  including statistical tests when appropriate; criteria for inclusion and  exclusion of subjects/participants; period of the study; location of the study;  ethical considerations (approval number by the Ethics in Research Committee);  use of the Free and Clarified Consent Term and/or Consent Term for Use of Data,  when appropriate. </p>
      <p><strong>Results</strong>:  results should be described in logical order. When tables and illustrations are presented,  accompanying text should complement, not repeat what is described in them.  Results should be presented separate from the discussion when dealing with  original articles resulting from studies with quantitative approaches. </p>
      <p><strong>Discussion</strong>: this should contain comparison of results with the  representative literature and interpretation by the author(s). This should be  written together with the results in qualitative studies. </p>
      <p><strong>Conclusions  or Final Considerations</strong>:  these should emphasize the most important findings, comment on limitations and  implications for new research and for the body of knowledge in the field of  Nursing and Health care. </p>
      <p><strong>References</strong>: No more than 20 references should be presented for  original articles and 15 for reflective articles. There is no limit to  references for systematic reviews and integrative reviews. References should be  recent (last five years), but are acceptable outside of this period if they  belong to the fundamental references for the study, and international  references must also be cited. In the case of theses and dissertations, it is  recommendable to quote, preferentially, the authors/articles used in them. </p>
      <p>These should be typed with default spacing and  separated by default spacing (1.15 lines). In this section, the title is  &quot;References&quot; and not &quot;Bibliographical References&quot;. The  reference list should be composed of all works cited, numbered by their  occurrence in the text body. The Vancouver reference style should be used, by  the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICM JE), updated in  2013, available at: <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html" target="_blank">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html</a> and  adapted by RGE (cf. reference examples). Titles of periodicals should be  abbreviated according to NLM Catalog:Journals  referenced in the NCBI Databases, available at: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/journals. Para" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/journals</a>. For<em> periodicals not found on this website, </em>abbreviations can be used from the <em>Cat&aacute;logo Coletivo Nacional de Publica&ccedil;&otilde;es  Seriadas</em> (CCN), by IBICT available at: <a href="http://ccn.ibict.br/busca.jsf" target="_blank">http://ccn.ibict.br/busca.jsf</a> and the<em> Portal de Revistas  Cient&iacute;ficas em Ci&ecirc;ncias da Sa&uacute;de da BVS</em>, available at: <a href="http://portal.revistas.bvs.br" target="_blank">http://portal.revistas.bvs.br</a>. </p>
      <p><strong>Quotes: </strong>these should be  presented in the text using the numeric system, with corresponding numbers  between parentheses and superscript, without space between the word and quota  number. In quotes, author names should not be mentioned, excluding expressions  like: &quot;according to...&quot;. When a quote is sequential, numbers should  be separated by hyphens and when interspersed, should be separated by a comma. When words, sentences or paragraphs in the author's words  are transcribed (direct quote), opening and closing quotation marks should be  used for the text. Careful use of this feature is  recommended, following ABNTNBR 10520/2002 (<em>Informa&ccedil;&atilde;o  e Documenta&ccedil;&atilde;o &ndash; Cita&ccedil;&otilde;es em documentos &ndash; Apresenta&ccedil;&atilde;o</em>). </p>
      <p>Examples: <br>
        Research shows that...<sup>(1-4)</sup>. <br>
        Several authors believe that...<sup>(1,4-5)</sup>. <br>
  &ldquo;[...] and the following years there was a  repeat of the same&rdquo;<sup>(7)</sup>. </p>
      <p>Manuscripts may also contain: </p>
      <p><strong>Statements: </strong>sentences or paragraphs said by subjects/participants of the research.  Do not use quotation marks, and observe the following structure: paragraph  indentation (1.25 cm), font size 11, in italics, default spacing, with  identification within parentheses, coded according to the author's criteria and  separated by default spacing. Omissions should be indicated by the use of  ellipses within brackets &quot;[...]&quot; and interventions by the author on  what was said by participants of the study should be presented within brackets. </p>
      <p><strong>Illustrations</strong>:  no more than five (images, graphs and tables), in black and white, following  these specifications: </p>
      <p>-<strong>Images and graphs</strong>:  presented according to ABNT NBR 6022/2003 <em>(Informa&ccedil;&atilde;o  e documenta&ccedil;&atilde;o - Artigo em publica&ccedil;&atilde;o peri&oacute;dica cient&iacute;fica impressa &ndash;  Apresenta&ccedil;&atilde;o</em>); </p>
      <p>-<strong>Tables: </strong>should be presented according to IBGE &ndash; Normas de Apresenta&ccedil;&atilde;o Tabular,  available in Portuguese at:  <a href="http://biblioteca.ibge.gov.br/visualizacao/livros/liv23907.pdf" target="_blank">http://biblioteca.ibge.gov.br/visualizacao/livros/liv23907.pdf</a>; </p>
      <p>-<strong>Other illustrations: </strong>presented  according to ABNT NBR 6022/2003 (<em>Informa&ccedil;&atilde;o  e documenta&ccedil;&atilde;o - Artigo em publica&ccedil;&atilde;o peri&oacute;dica cient&iacute;fica impressa &ndash;  Apresenta&ccedil;&atilde;o</em>); </p>
