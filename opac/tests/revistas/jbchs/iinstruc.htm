    <td width="70%"><p>The <b><i>Journal of the Brazilian Chemical Society</i></b> (<b><i>JBCS</i></b>) embraces all aspects of chemistry except education, philosophy and history. It is a medium for reporting selected original and significant contributions to new chemical knowledge. The Journal publishes <b>Articles, Communications</b>, <b>Short Reports</b>, <b>Reviews</b>, <b>Accounts</b> and <b>Letters</b>.<br>
        The reproduction of figures, schemes and photos already published in other publications, even if these materials have been published by the same authors, requires the copyright permission given by the editor house allowing the publication of the article in the <b><i>JBCS</i></b>.
      <p><b>Manuscript types</b></p>
      <p> <b>Article </b>should be comprehensive and critical accounts of a work in a given area. Although short articles are acceptable, the Editors strongly discourage fragmentation of a substantial body of work into a number of short publications.</p>
      <p><b>Communication </b>should be restricted to reports of <b>unusual urgency</b> and <b>significance</b> or <b>interest</b>. They should be submitted with a <b>statement</b> from the authors as to <b>why the manuscript meets these criteria</b>. A manuscript will not be accepted if, in the opinion of the Editors, the principal content has previously been released or published in any other medium. The communication should not exceed 1500 words or occupy more than 3 pages of the Journal. To estimate the length of a communication, an average sized figure is counted as 100 words and separate formulae and lines of a table are counted as 8 words per line, including headings and horizontal rulings. Title, authors' names and literature references are not counted.</p>
      <p><b>Short Report </b>is meant to be a concise terminal report of studies of limited scope. Manuscripts submitted as articles or communications may, in some cases, be accepted as short reports. The standard of quality expected in short reports is the same as in articles.</p>
      <p><b>Review </b>is normally invited by the Editors. However, <u>the Editors welcome suggestions for reviews</u> considered suitable for the Journal. Be aware that the <b>topics</b> (items) in the <b>Reviews </b>must be<b> numbered</b> with Arabic numerals.</p>
      <p> In order to help the Editors in the evaluation of the suitability of a proposed Review, the authors should previously submit by e-mail (<a href="mailto:office@jbcs.sbq.org.br">office@jbcs.sbq.org.br</a>) the following items:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A synopsis including a brief outline of the Review content;</li>
        <li>At least ten sample references;</li>
        <li>A summary of the lead author's academic career;</li>
        <li>A statement explaining the relevance of the topic to be reviewed and a list of the latest reviews published on the subject, if any;</li>
        <li>If the text is already prepared (with the above items have been considered by the Editors), an invitation for submission will be sent for the author by the <b><i>JBCS</i></b>/ScholarOne system;</li>
        <li>A short Curriculum Vitae (max. 100 words) with photo for each author needs to be added in the end of the main document.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><u>Acceptance of the synopsis does not guarantee publication of the final manuscript</u>.</p>
      <p>It is quite common, in Reviews, the reproduction of figures, schemes and photos already published in other works. Even if these materials have been published by the same authors, copyright permissions need to be given by the editorial office.</p>
      <p><b>Account</b> is published only by invitation from the Editorial Board. Like the Review, it may include figures, schemes, structures, etc. The <b>topics</b> in the <b>Account </b>must be<b> numbered</b> with Arabic numerals.</p>
      <p> In order to help the Editors in the evaluation of the suitability of a proposed Account, authors should previously submit by e-mail (<a href="mailto:office@jbcs.sbq.org.br">office@jbcs.sbq.org.br</a>) a synopsis considering the following items:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>submission of a focused and readable text, covering current areas of interest for the Chemistry community;</li>
        <li>it is necessary to present topics or summaries of research in an emerging area of Chemistry, covering only the most interesting/significant developments;</li>
        <li>in the conclusion section, the discussion is about possible future approaches of the Account subject;</li>
        <li>a short Curriculum Vitae (max. 100 words) with photo for each author needs to be added in the end of the main document.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In case any reproduction of figures, schemes and photos already published in other journals is included, a copyright permission given by the editorial office of the publisher must be sent to <b><i>JBCS</i></b> office.</p>
      <p><b>Letter </b>is a medium for the expression of scientific opinions and views normally concerning material published in the Journal, but not for revision/update of the authors' own work. When a <b>Letter</b> polemical in nature is accepted, a reply from the implicated parties will be requested for publication alongside the original <b>Letter</b>. Contributions in this format are intended to be published as soon as possible. No Abstract is required for letters. They should not exceed one printed page in length.</p>
      <p><b>Before Beginning the Submission</b></p>
      <p><b>Copyright License</b></p>
      <p>The submission of a manuscript implies that it has not been previously published, that it is not under consideration for publication elsewhere or that it will not be simultaneously published elsewhere in the same format without the written permission of the Editors. Additionally, it implies that the submitting author has the consent of all authors. By submitting a manuscript, the authors agree that their paper's copyright is transferred to the Brazilian Chemical Society (<i>Sociedade Brasileira de Qu&iacute;mica, SBQ</i>) if and when the manuscript is accepted for publication. Accepted manuscripts and illustrations become the property of the SBQ.</p>
      <p><b>Manuscript Organization</b></p>
      <p>Authors should present their materials with the utmost conciseness and clarity. The <b>Introduction</b> should clearly and briefly identify, with relevant references, both the nature of the problem under investigation and its background. Extensive reviews of the literature cannot be accepted.</p>
      <p> In <b>Articles</b> and <b>Short Reports</b>, the <b>Experimental</b> section may precede or follow the <b>Results and Discussion</b> section, but should be separated from it. The addition of a final section at the end of the manuscript, which briefly summarizes the main <b>Conclusions</b> of the work, is recommended and needs to be just after the <b>Results and Discussion</b> section.</p>
      <p><b>Descriptions of experiments</b> should be given in sufficient details to enable other researchers to repeat them. The degree of purity of materials should be given, as well as all quantities used. Descriptions of established procedures are unnecessary. Standard techniques and methods used throughout the work should be stated at the beginning of the section in a <b>Materials and/or Methods</b> subsection, in the <b>Experimental</b> section. Apparatus should be described only if it is non-standard. Commercially available instruments should be referred to by their suppliers and models.</p>
      <p> All <b>new compounds</b> should be fully characterized, which includes spectroscopic data and elemental analyses. High-resolution mass spectra may substitute for elemental analyses if accompanied by unequivocal proof of sample purity (melting points, copies of NMR spectra, etc.). For compounds prepared in enantiomerically pure or enantiomerically enriched form, specific optical rotation must be given. In cases where enantiomeric excess is determined by chromatographic and/or spectroscopic techniques, copies of the appropriate chromatograms and/or spectra should be included as Supplementary Information upon submission of the manuscript. Data associated with specific compounds should be listed after the name of the compound concerned, followed by the description of the preparation, or else presented in tabular form in the <b>Results and Discussion</b> section. All spectra must be included in the <b>Supplementary Information </b>(<b>SI</b>, see Section 8).</p>
      <p> Many theoretical and computational papers use a routine procedure based on a well-documented method, being it semi-empirical or <i>ab initio</i>. It is then sufficient to name the particular variant, referring to key papers, in which the method has been developed, to cite the computer program used and to indicate briefly any modification made by the author.</p>
      <p> Complementary data meant to support the analysis of <b>Communications</b> should be included as <b>Supplementary Information </b>(SI, see Section 8).<br>
        It is the <b>authors' responsibility</b> to obtain permission from other publishers for the reproduction of artwork from other journals in the reviews or in any other type of publication. Such specific <b>Copyright Permissions</b>should be sent to the <b><i>JBCS</i></b> Editorial Manager. Suitable acknowledgement of reproduction must be given in the captions.</p>
      <p><strong>Article  Processing Charges &ndash; APCs</strong><br>
JBCS adopted the full open access format in which authors are required  to cover part of the publication costs for their articles.&nbsp; The online journal is free.</p>
      <p> Article Processing Charges (APCs)<br>
        Discounts is offered to corresponding authors that are active members of  the Sociedade Brasileira de Qu&iacute;mica (SBQ (see below), and this publication fee  will be applicable just after manuscript acceptance by Editors. The manuscript  evaluation by Peer Review remains unaltered.</p>
      <p>        Payments will be received through the PayPal  system <u>for Overseas</u>, which is a safe, flexible and well-established  service for on-line payments. For Brazilian Authors, please make a bank  deposit/transfer and send your payment receipt to <a href="javascript:%20window.parent.Mandic.control.composeMessage('to=office@jbcs.sbq.org.br');">office@jbcs.sbq.org.br</a>.</p>

<p class="subtitulo"><a name="04" id="04"><b>Guidelines for Illustrations</b></a></p>
<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="15%"></td>
    <td width="70%"><p><b>General Size</b>
      <p>The authors should think about the illustration size for double column (172 mm) of the journal. But, the font type size of text must be consistent with the illustration since it can be reduced during preparation of the Galley Proof.</p>
      <p> This is important when choosing symbols for graphics, drawings, charts, photos, etc., be consistent, make your manuscript look nicer: use the same size and same font type in graphics, schemes, etc.</p>
      <p><b>4.1 Graphs and Figures</b> (also see Section 2)</p>
      <p><b>Lines and Lettering:</b>Lines should be black and of an adequate and even thickness. Solid, broke, dotted and dot-dash lines should be used in graphics. Particular care should be taken to ensure that the lines in a spectrum are of adequate thickness.</p>
      <p> Lettering should not be smaller than 7 pt (Times New Roman) and lines not thinner than 0.5 pt. Lettering and lines should be of uniform density throughout the figures.</p>
      <p><b>Labeled atoms in ORTEP</b> (or any other) diagrams should have atom numbers in parenthesis, e.g., Fe(1), C(44).</p>
      <p><b>Symbols </b>representing physical quantities should be given in italics, e.g., <i>J</i> (Hz), <i>&#916;</i> (ppm), <i>m/z</i>, etc.</p>
      <p><b>Units</b> should be expressed in the appropriate form, e.g., g cm-3 or mol L-1, rather than g/cm3or mol/L (see Section 4.5)</p>
      <p><b>Graphs</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Scales:</b> graphs should have only the minimum necessary scale divisions marked by numerals.</li>
        <li><b>Axis labels</b> should use SI units, separated from quantities (see details in the green book <a href="http://old.iupac.org/reports/1993/homann/index.html" target="_blank">http://old.iupac.org/reports/1993/homann/index.html</a>):</li>
      </ul>
      <p> For graphs, use slashes in X and Y axes to separate axes names from units. For example:&nbsp;&nbsp; 2q / degree; Temperature / oC; time / min; Size range / mm; Wavenumber / cm-1. Use parentheses only to group a set of units, e.g., Concentration / (mol L-1) ; 103 (T/K)-1, etc.</p>
      <p><b><u>Pay close attention</u></b><u> to the way decimal values are expressed in English. Employ dots instead of commas</u>.</p>
      <p><b>Figures</b> must have a high quality in order to be well reproduced. Use at least a 900 dpi resolution. If necessary, resize to a smaller size to get higher quality.</p>
      <p><b>Curves</b> should be labeled (a), (b), (c) etc. and further information be given in the figure legend/caption.</p>
      <p><b>Data Points</b> must be shown sufficiently large to be distinguishable. Whenever possible, they should be marked with the following symbols (use alternated full and open symbols):</p>
      <p align="center">&#9679;, &#9675;, &#9632;, &#9633;, &#9650;, &#916;, &diams; , &#9826;</p>
      <p><b>Graphs/Figures</b> should be pasted from their original files (Origin, ChemDraw, Corel etc.) and have an excellent quality. If you have to digitalize (scan) the figures (photos, for instance), choose the following scan options: black &amp; white (B&amp;W), no background and minimum of 300 dpi. If you wish them to be published online in color, send both the colored and B&amp;W versions to the Editorial Office, matching the captions of the figures to accommodate the alternatives.</p>
      <p><u>For computer-generated artwork, background or shadings should be avoided</u>.</p>
      <p><b>4.2 Structural Formulae</b></p>
      <p>Figures, schemes and structures should be drawn to fit single or double-column widths. They should look proportional in case they are reduced.<br>
        Structures should be numbered with bold Arabic numerals, e.g.,<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>.</p>
      <p> All chemical structures included in the manuscript should be drawn using the same letter type (Times New Roman or Arial), size of cyclic groups, size and thickness of chemical bonds, and, the most important, authors should use the same standard throughout the work, including all figures, schemes, etc.</p>
      <p> The following organic group abbreviations may be used: Me, Et, nPr, nBu, sBu, tBu, Ph, CO2R, CO2H, iPrOH.</p>
      <p> One variable univalent substituent is indicated by R. When more than one independent variable general substituent is present, R1, R2, R3, etc. should be used.</p>
      <p> A variable metal may be indicated by M and variable ligands by L1, L2, L3 or L1, L2, L3, etc.</p>
      <p><b>4.3 Photographs</b></p>
      <p>Photographs should be highly contrasted, positive and not mounted.</p>
      <p> When necessary, the scale should be drawn on the photograph itself and not below.</p>
      <p> Color prints are rarely reproduced satisfactorily in black and white. Original B&amp;W photographs are preferred to report experimental results, such as electron micrographs or to illustrate special equipment adaptations.</p>
      <p><b>4.4 Colored Illustrations</b></p>
      <p><b>Online Version</b></p>
      <p> From 2010 onwards, the publication of colored illustrations will be totally free of charge in the ONLINE version of the Journal.</p>
      <p><b>Printed Version</b></p>
      <p> Black &amp; White (B&amp;W) illustrations are free of charge. If color figures are presented in your Manuscript (Ms), they will automatically be converted into black-and-white (except GA). Color prints rarely reproduce satisfactorily in black and white. Thus, pay attention so that no information is missed because of the conversion. If the authors want to have colored illustrations on the printed version, they will be asked to pay for their cost: the current fee is 250 USD for all figures (remember that in the online version, they are free of charge).</p>
      <p><b>4.5 Tables, Data and Units</b></p>
      <p><b>Tables</b></p>
      <p> Format your table to give straightforward information to the reader. Do not use shades or bold lettering. Indicate any extra information as a footnote with letters, e.g., a, b, c, etc. For examples, see any &quot;PDF&quot; files in: <a href="http://jbcs.sbq.org.br/forthcoming_papers.asp" target="_blank">http://jbcs.sbq.org.br/forthcoming_papers.asp</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Data</b></p>
      <p> For negative numbers, ions and equations in text and tables use - (negative symbol) instead of - (hyphen). Examples: Cl-,&nbsp; -0.40,&nbsp; <i>y</i> = a<i>x</i> - b.</p>
      <p><b>Units</b></p>
      <p> Use International System Units (SI), e.g., m, s, kg, Pa, mol L-1, etc, separated from quantities with a blank space. Example: 300 K, not 300K. See: <a href="http://old.iupac.org/reports/1993/homann/index.html" target="_blank">http://old.iupac.org/reports/1993/homann/index.html</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Note</b>: Molar (M) is no longer a valid concentration expression for IUPAC; it is suggested mol L-1 or mol dm-3, but be consistent throughout your manuscript.</p>

    <td width="70%"><p>Concerning the <b><i>JBCS</i></b> Table of Contents, it is expected from authors careful with their <b>Graphical Abstract (</b>GA) proposition.
      <p> This way, the figure should summarize the content of the manuscript in a concise, pictorial form, designed to capture the attention of a wide readership. The author should present a new figure, using as an idea a key structure, a reaction, an equation, a concept, a graphic, a theorem, etc. It should use colors as much as possible and have an artistic and imaginative idea. Short movies are also welcome (as supplementary information (SI)). It is not acceptable photos of commercial equipment in GA or in the text of the manuscripts.
      <p><b>Pay Attention</b>: the image should have a 900 dpi resolution (*.tiff &nbsp;/ *.jpg or any other image file that can be edited and be 8 cm wide and 4 cm high). Along with the GA figure, insert a short explanatory text about it below (three lines at the most)</p>
      <p>Take a look at our recent publications whose Table of Contents presents Graphical Abstracts (<a href="http://jbcs.sbq.org.br" target="_blank">http://jbcs.sbq.org.br</a>). Therefore, be smart to advertise your manuscript: send a beautiful and appealing graphical image.</p></td>

E-mail: <a href="mailto:deposit@ccdc.cam.ac.uk">deposit@ccdc.cam.ac.uk</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Preparation of Crystallographic Material</b></p>
      <p>When the manuscript is submitted, the following guidelines should be observed:</p>
      <p> The Abstract should not contain crystal data, but a concise statement of the main features of the structural results.</p>
      <p> The following crystallographic data should be given in a paragraph of a Table, in a concise format:</p>
      <p>8.1.1 Color, habit and size of the crystal(s) used, behavior of the compound under the data collection conditions.</p>
      <p>8.1.2 The chemical formula should correspond to the complete chemical unit encompassing the crystallographic symmetry, the formula weight, F(000), the absorption coefficient and the measured and calculated densities.</p>
      <p>8.1.3 The unit cell parameters with esd's and the X-ray wavelength used.</p>
      <p>8.1.4 The crystal system, space group and number of chemical units per cell.</p>
      <p>8.1.5 Type of diffractometer used and method of data collection, total number of data collected, number of unique reflections, R(int) value, number of observed reflections with cut-off parameter, use or not of absorption correction, transmission factors.</p>
      <p>8.1.6 The final results: R, wR, S and the number of parameters refined; treatment of hydrogen atoms; final peak and hole in the last difference map. Only refinements on F2 will be accepted.</p>
      <p><b>Discussion of the Structure</b></p>
      <p>It must include a labeled diagram of the structure, a list of relevant geometric parameters - interatomic bond distances and angles, torsion angles, hydrogen bond parameters, etc. Data of less important parts of the structure, such as ligand sub-groups (phenyl rings, etc.) should be omitted.</p>
      <p><b>8.2 Manuscripts including NMR, IR, mass spectra, etc.</b></p>
      <p>Whenever a compound is synthesized or identified (new or already known), it is imperative to send all spectral data (data and spectra) as Supplementary Information (SI) along with your submission, at the end of your doc file.</p>
      <p>A brief mention to the existence of complementary data should be included in the Supplementary Information topic before the <b>Acknowledgments</b> section. Example:</p>
      <p><b>Supplementary Information</b></p>
      <p>Supplementary information (Figure S1-S4, Table S1) is available free of charge at <a href="http://jbcs.org.br" target="_blank">http://jbcs.org.br</a> as doc file. </p>
      <p>How to send this type of information:</p>
      <p>Join all spectra in one SI file. Do not forget to add captions to each one of them, identifying each individual spectrum (e.g., Figure S1. 1H NMR Spectrum of...; Figure S2. IR Spectrum of...; Figure S3. 13C{1H} Spectrum of...; Table S1. Data for...). If the spectra will be digitalized (scanned), choose options: black&amp;white, without background and 300 dpi at least. Add this file to the <u>end of your manuscript</u>, which should then comprehend one single doc file, containing GA, text with tables and figures, and SI.</p></td>
