    <td width="70%"><p>The editorial policy of&nbsp;<b>INTER</b>&nbsp;has as its principle, the registering  and divulging of knowledge from the national and international scientific  community. For this, it stimulates and develops interchange among researchers,  teachers, students and professionals, who are active within the theme of local  development, facilitating the approximation between scientific knowledge and  the community. Another slant of the journal is to foment the interchange of information and  experiences within the ambit of local development and related themes with other  institutions, thus establishing a channel for the transmitting of studies and  recent progress in the various areas of knowledge which converge on the themes  in question.</p>
      <p> The areas of interest of <b>INTER</b> are directed towards local development  within the context of territoriality, which touch on micro and small  undertakings: business chains, systems and local production arrangements,  agro-forest systems and animal raising, productive chains, focusing on&nbsp;  processes which are interactive, cooperative, innovative and sustainable.  Also of great interest to the journal are publications focusing on social-community dimensions  with attention to traditional communities: the theory of social grouping,  traditional communities (indigenous peoples, communities made up of the  descendants of slaves, primitive fishermen, riverside populations, religious  communities, amongst others), with a focus on their way of life, accumulated  traditional knowledge and ways of territorial use for local development.</p>
      <p>        <b>INTER</b>&nbsp;publishes  articles which can focus on local development, via theoretical reflections and  reports of experiences, establishing a productive interaction between praxis  and concepts (articles, interviews, reports, praxis-concepts). The summaries of  dissertations are occasionally published which have been presented in the  Post-Graduate Studies program in Local Development - an academic Master's  Degree at the Dom Bosco Catholic University.</p>
      <p> The evaluation of&nbsp;<b>INTER</b>&nbsp;is carried out semiannually by the  members of the journal,  by the Counsel for the Program of Post-Graduate Studies in Local Development,  on which occasion the articles published are analyzed, with suggestions which  bring about constant improvements in the journal.</p>
      <p>The reading public of the journal are teachers, students, recent graduates, professionals  in diverse areas of knowledge, business managers in public and private  institutions, local, regional, national and international governing bodies.  Also there is a system of exchange with other institutions.</p>
