    <td width="70%">
	<p>Original manuscripts will be accepted for review as long as they have not been submitted to any other journal in parallel and/or published previously to preserve the original character of the article. They should be accompanied by: a submission cover letter, a completed submission checklist, and all other documents listed in the item "Documents". <strong>All documents must be signed by all authors</strong>.</p>
	<p> All manuscripts will only start undergoing the publication process if they are in agreement with the Instructions to the Authors. If not, <strong>they will be returned for the authors to make the appropriate adjustments</strong>, include a letter or other documents that may be necessary. See item preparation of the manuscript.</p>
	<p> Articles with any of the mistakes mentioned above <strong>will be returned even before they are submitted to assessment</strong> regarding the merit of the work and the convenience of its publication.</p>
	<p>        <strong>Pre-analysis</strong>: assessment is made by the Scientific Editors based on the originality, pertinence, academic quality, and relevance of the manuscript for the area of nutrition.</p>
	<p> Manuscripts approved in this stage will be sent to ad hoc referees. Each manuscript will be sent to three referees of known competence in the theme. The authors may choose one of them. If there is disagreement, the manuscript will be sent to a fourth referee.</p>
	<p> The peer review process used is the blind review, where the identity of the authors and the reviewers is not mutually known. Thus the authors must do everything possible to avoid the identification of the authors of the manuscript.</p>
	<p> The opinions of the reviewers are one of the following: (a) approved; (b) new analysis needed; (c) refused. The authors will always be informed of the reviewers' opinion.</p>
		<p> The referees' opinions will be analyzed by the associated editors, who will then suggest to the Scientific Editor whether the manuscript should be published. The Editor-in-Chief will make the final decision regarding the publication of the manuscript (Approved or Rejected).</p>
	<p> Rejected manuscripts that can be reformulated may be submitted again as a new manuscript and undergo a new assessment process. </p>
	<p> When changes are requested by the referees, the manuscript will be returned to the authors along with the referees' opinions and suggestions. The authors have 20 (twenty) days to make the adjustments, respecting the Greenwich (London) time.</p>
	<p><strong>Accepted manuscripts</strong>: manuscripts accepted for publication may return to the authors for approval of eventual changes made during the editing and formatting processes, according to the Journal's style.</p>
	<p><strong>Publication in English</strong>: if approved, the articles will be published in English. For the manuscript to be published, the authors must provide the English translation of the version approved by the Journal. The translation is paid for by the authors.</p>
	<p> In order to guarantee the quality and uniformity of the translated manuscripts, the manuscript must be translated by a highly trained translator with proven experience in the translation of scientific texts, indicated and certified by the Journal.</p>
	<p> If the manuscript needs reviewing by one of the translators indicated by the Journal, the authors must follow the formatting instructions provided by e-mail by the Journal. The authors are responsible for verifying the entire translation (body of the text, illustrations, tables, charts, etc.). <strong></strong></p>

        <li>Arial 12 pt;</li>
        <li>The total number of words in the manuscript should be within the word limit according to its category (the word count should include the words in the abstract and body of the manuscript but not the cover page, references, and illustrations);</li>
        <li>It should be arranged in the following order, including the items that must be presented on separate pages:  </li>       <ul>
        <li>Cover page (page 1);</li>

        <li>Page numbers must be placed on the lower left-hand corner;</li>
        <li>References format should facilitate manuscript revision and editing. Therefore, they should be written according to the Vancouver style, using 1.5 spacing between the lines and 12-point font size;</li>
        <li>The illustrations (Figures and Tables) must be inserted below the References, each one on a separate page, regardless of their size.</li>

Authorship credit must be based on substantial contributions, such as study conception and design, data analysis and interpretation, article review, and approval of the final version. Including the names of authors who have not made any of the contributions above is not justified. Authors' contribution should be written in the language the article will be published.</p>
      <p>i)  Inform the ORCID&reg;  (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) record number. If you do not have  one, register for free at: &lt; <a href="https://orcid.org/register">https://orcid.org/register</a>&gt;. Learn more <a href="http://orcid.org/about/what-is-orcid">here</a>. </p>
