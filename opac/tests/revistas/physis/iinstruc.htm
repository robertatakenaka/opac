 <td width="70%" height="658"> <p><strong><em>Physis</em></strong><strong> publishes  articles in the following categories:</strong></p>
   <p>
       <strong>Original unsolicited articles (up to 7,000 words,  including endnotes and references):</strong> unpublished  papers resulting from research or bibliographical analysis. The Editorial Board  decides on the publication of any submitted papers, based on anonymous assessment  of reviewers - double-blind peer review - and according to space availability.</p>
   <p>     <strong>Original articles at the editor's invitation (up  to 8,000 words, including endnotes and references):</strong> unpublished  articles resulting from research or bibliographical analysis. The Editorial Board  and the invited editor may either ask experienced authors to forward original papers  on previously decided themes, according to the journal planning, or decide on the  acceptance, based on anonymous assessment of two reviewers (double-blind peer review).  Reviews and comments usually come at the invitation to the authors by the Editors.  Articles that, due to their authorial characteristic, cannot be anonymously assessed,  will be analyzed by an anonymous reviewer (<em>single-blind peer review</em>). The  number of authors will be limited to a maximum of two per manuscript, and each author  may appear only in one article per issue.</p>
   <p>     <strong>Reviews (up to 4,000 words, including endnotes  and references):</strong> <em>Physis</em> welcomes unsolicited reviews and  invites authors to send them as well. The Editorial Board will decide on the publication,  considering the theme, quality of manuscript and space availability. Reviews will  only be accepted with a single author.</p>
   <p>       <strong>Interviews (up to 4,000 words)</strong>: this section welcomes testimonies of people whose life stories or professional  achievements are relevant to the journal's scope.</p>
   <p>        <strong>Letters (up to 1,500 words)</strong>: this section welcomes comments on articles published in the journal or  notes and opinions on issues of interest to readers.</p>

   <p>
     14. If an article is already accepted for publication,  it will be possible to publish it in English as well, if this is the author's interest.
