      <p>The <b>Acta Scientiarum. Agronomy </b>journal publishes original articles 

        in all areas of Agronomy, including soil sciences, agricultural entomology, 

        soil fertility and manuring, soil physics, physiology of cultivated plants, 

        phytopathology, phyto-health, phytotechny, genesis, morphology and soil 

        classification, management and conservation of soil, integrated management 

        of plant pests, vegetal improvement, agricultural microbiology and production 

        and processing of seeds.<br>

        Articles will be reviewed by three peers acknowledged for their scientific 

        production and research, from higher institutions in Brazil and abroad. 

        After the necessary corrections and possible suggestions, the paper shall 

        be accepted if two peers give a favorable statement.</p>

      <p><b>Its aims are:</b><br>

        - To publish original articles in thematic areas relevant to Vegetal 

        Production;<br>

        - To publish articles that significantly contribute towards the knowledge 

        of Vegetal production, featuring a scientific stance and in-depth knowledge 

        on themes and trends within Vegetal production;<br>

        - To reach its target public which mainly consists of undergraduate 

        and postgraduate students and researchers working in universities, research 

        centers and firms both in Brazil and abroad.<br>

        - To provide a strict evaluation policy with articles sent for publication; 

        each manuscript is evaluated by three revisers who are carefully selected 

        from the scientific community, especially doctoral supervisors and CNPq's 

        productivity researchers; acceptance of article is the result of the revisers' 

        assessment and of the editors concerned;<br>

        - To respect the ethical principles of research which should be explicitly 

        acknowledged in the Materials &amp; Methods section (and approved by the 

        ethics committee in vegetal research) and taking into account the biosecurity 

        norms inherent to this type of research; <br>

        - To maintain a high ethical behavior with regard to the review and 

        its collaborators;<br>

        - To maintain strict quality in scientific article to be published;<br>

        - To select revisers featuring ethical stance and professional respect 

        to authors, impartial in their decisions and imparting constructive and 

        professional criticism;<br>

        

      - To select revisers scientifically acknowledged by colleagues in their 

        area of knowledge, with special preference to CNPq's productivity scholars.

      <p>All articles should be written in English, which will be verified by the <i>American 

      Journal Experts (AJE)</i>. </p>
      <p><strong>OPEN  ACCESS POLICY</strong> <br>
        Acta Scientiarum. Agronomy is published under the Open Access model and  is therefore free for anybody to read and download, and to copy and disseminate  according to the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 policy.</p>
      <p><strong>APCS  (ARTICLE PROCESSING CHARGES) AND SUBMISSION CHARGES</strong><br>
        Acta Scientiarum. Agronomy is free of any kind of submission/publication  fees, thus the authors are not charged to publish with us.</p>
      <p><strong>POLICIES AGAINST PLAGIARISM AND BAD CONDUCT IN RESEARCH</strong> <br>
        In the wake of our tradition in excellence, we would like to inform  collaborators on editorial improvements that foreground the integrity of  articles published by the&nbsp;<em>Acta Scientiarum</em>. Following guidelines by  the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) stimulating the identification of  the practice of plagiarism, bad practices, frauds, possible violations in  Ethics and indicting, we would like to recommend the following:</p>
      <p><strong>1. Authors are invited to visit the COPE website&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://publicationethics.org/">http://publicationethics.org</a>&nbsp;for information on authors and editors on Ethics in research;</p>
      <p><strong>2. Prior to submission of scientific articles, authors should follow the  criteria below:</strong> <br>
        - articles that contain data acquisition or analysis and interpretation  of data from other publications should refer to the latter explicitly and  directly;<br>
        - articles with a critical review on the intellectual contents of other  authors should duly quote the latter authors;<br>
        - all authors should attend to the authorship criteria of an unpublished  article and no researcher involved in the investigation should be omitted from  the list of authors;<br>
        - the definite approval of the article is the role of the respective  editors and of the editorial board.</p>
      <p><strong>3. So that the above criteria could be complied with, the following  procedures will be taken:</strong> <br>
        a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Editors will evaluate manuscripts by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.crossref.org/08downloads/handouts/crosscheck.pdf"><strong><em>CrossCheck</em></strong></a>&nbsp;system immediately  after submission. Contents of the scientific articles will be evaluated to  identify any sort of plagiarism, double submissions, already published articles  and possible frauds in research;<br>
        b)&nbsp; With these results in hand, the editors and the editorial board  decide whether the manuscript is sent for the review of peers, who will also  make their own evaluations;<br>
        c) After acceptance and prior to publication,  the article may again be assessed.</p>
