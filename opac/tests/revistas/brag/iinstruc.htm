    <P>Authors should  type in the &quot;Comments to the Editor&quot; a cover letter presenting the  work and explaining the main contribution to the Agricultural Sciences. The  letter should indicate that the work was not submitted for publication  elsewhere.
    <P> Articles and  reviews should not exceed 25 double-spaced pages (A4 paper with margins of 3  cm, font Times New Roman size 12, pages and lines numbered sequentially),  including tables and figures. The Research Notes should not exceed 12 pages,  including tables and figures.
    <P> The text should  be typed into the Word (Microsoft) program and double-spaced. The main  divisions of the text (Introduction, Methods, Results and Discussion and  Conclusions) should be in uppercase and bold. Scientific notes do not have  divisions.
    <P> The title of  the manuscript must reflect the content of the work and should not have  subtitles, abbreviations, formulas or equations and symbols. The scientific  name must be indicated in the title only if the species is unknown.
    <P> The names of  the authors and  co-authors should be included in the online system  in the same order they appear in the final work. Please, do not indicate the  authorship of the work in the text of the manuscript.
    <P> The abstract  must have the goal of the research clearly and concisely, the methods briefly  and the most relevant results and conclusions. The abstract should not exceed  250 words with short sentences with complete connection with each other. It  must not contain references.    
    <P> The key words should  not repeat title words and should include the scientific name of species. Words  must be separated by a comma and begin with small letters,&nbsp;<strong>including  the first term</strong>. The authors should present from 3 to 6 terms, considering  that a term may be composed of two or more words.
    <P> The  Introduction should have no more than two pages. It should include the  rationale for conducting the work, placing the importance of the scientific  problem. The information contained in the Introduction should be sufficient to  clearly establish the hypothesis of the research. The authors should cite  recent studies published in scientific journals, but the citation of classical  works is accepted. In the last paragraph of the Introduction, the authors must  submit a scientific hypothesis and the objective of the study, the same as the  summary.
    <P> Material and  Methods should present a description of the experimental conditions and methods  used so that there is enough information to repeat the work. Formulas, expressions,  or mathematical equations should be initiated to the left of the page. Include  references to statistical analysis and report about the transformation of the  data. Indication of statistical significance should be as follows: p &lt;0.01  or p&gt; 0.05 (&quot;p&quot; in lower case).
    
    <P> In Results and  Discussion, the authors should present the research results and discuss them in  order to relate the variables examined to the objectives of the study. The mere  comparison of results with the data presented by other authors did not  characterize the discussion of them. The authors should avoid excessive  speculation and the data should not be presented both in tables and figures.
    <P> The Conclusion must answer  the question addressed in the research, confirming or not the hypothesis of the  work, according to the objectives. The authors should be aware that the  conclusion is not a summary of the main results.    
    <P> Only the  strictly necessary references for the understanding of the article should be  cited, we recommend around 25 references to articles and scientific notes. The  list of references should begin on a new page.    
    <P> Citations in  the text should always be followed by their year of publication. When two authors  are cited, indicate them by the surnames separated by an ampersand &ldquo;and&rdquo;; For more than two authors, indicate the first author  by the surname followed by the expression &ldquo;et al.&rdquo;; if more than one article of  the same author(s) in the same year is cited, distinguish them by using  lowercase letters; e.g., Huber (1981) or (Huber 1981); Steel and Torrie (1980) or  (Steel and Torrie,  1980); Haag et al. (1992) or (Haag et al. 1992); and Haag et al. (1992 a, b).    
    <P> The following  citations will not be accepted: theses, dissertations, personal communications,  unpublished reports, and papers published in conference annals.
    <P> References are  standardized according to the models mentioned below. They should be in  alphabetical order of authors and, within this order, in chronological order of  works; in the case of two or more authors, separate them by commas and an the word &ldquo;and between the second last and last authors; indicate  the name of all authors, do not use the expression &nbsp;&ldquo;et al.&rdquo;; titles of  journals should be written in full; include only the works cited in the text,  tables and/or figures as follows:

      When absolutely  necessary to the understanding of the work, tables and figures should be shown  in the text. The table or figure and its respective caption should be  self-explanatory. The titles of tables and figures should be clear and complete  and include the name (common or scientific) of the species and the dependent  variables.&nbsp;<strong>Figures should appear at the end of the text</strong>. We  considered figures: graphs, drawings, maps and photographs used to illustrate  the text. For composite figures, each graph should be marked with the  inscription &quot;(a)&quot; in lowercase.</p>
    <p>  <strong>Tables  should not have vertical lines and, as the figures, should be placed after the  listing of references</strong> Figures and tables must be accompanied by its  caption, with the units following the International System of Units and positioned  at the top of the columns in the tables. The magnitudes, in case of compound  units, should be separated by centered dot and an indication of the denominators must be rated  in superscript. Examples: (&micro;mol&middot;m-2 s-1), [mg (g&middot;MS)-1]. </p>
    IMPORTANT  RECOMMENDATIONS:&nbsp;<br>
- In case of work involving tillage, the history of the area should be  informed.&nbsp;<br>
- Not to mention the lab, department, center or university where the research  was conducted.&nbsp;<br>
- Work related to the chemical control of pests and diseases (with natural and  synthetic) and studies involving micro-propagation and tissue culture will not  be considered for publication in Bragantia. In the case of plant growth  regulators, biostimulant and other chemicals, the work must necessarily  establish a well-founded hypothesis, and the chemical agent must be used to  test the hypothesis and answer the question raised in the article.&nbsp;<br>
- Authors should consult recent issue of Bragantia to the layout of tables and  figures.&nbsp;<br>
- In the online submission of work, the names of the author and co-authors must  be entered into the System in the same order they appear in the final work. Do  not indicate the authorship of the work in the text of the manuscript.&nbsp;<br>
-  Failure to standards will require the return of work.</TD>
