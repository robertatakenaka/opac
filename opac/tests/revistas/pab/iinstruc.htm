      <p><b>Analysis of the manuscripts<br>
        </b>The Editorial Board performs an analysis, before submitting the manuscripts 
        to the referees. This analysis considers aspects such as scope, preparation 
        of articles according to the journal's instructions, originality of the 
        objectives, style of the composition, theoretical basis, an updated literature 
        review, consistent and accurate methodology, results containing useful 
        contributions, discussion of the observed facts in relation to the facts 
        described in the literature, quality of tables and figures, and originality 
        and consistency of the conclusions. After using these criteria, rejected papers will be returned to authors, 
        and accepted ones will be submitted to the technical referees' analysis. 
      </p>
      <p><b>Form and preparation of manuscripts<br>
        </b>Papers submitted to PAB must be original, not simultaneously submitted 
        to or previously published in any other scientific or technical journal. 
        Data previously published in abstracts containing more than 250&nbsp;words 
        must not be included in the paper. </p>
      <p>Scientific Articles, Scientific Notes, and Review Articles (this last 
        one only by the Editor's invitation) are the formats accepted by PAB. 
      </p>
      <p>Papers published are grouped in technical areas according to their main 
        subject. The major technical areas are Entomology, Plant Physiology, Plant 
        Pathology, Crop Science, Pomology, Genetics, Microbiology, Mineral Nutrition, 
        Soil Science, and Animal Science. </p>

      <p><b>Citations<br>
        </b>References of summaries, documents in the press, or of any other source, 
        whose data have not been published yet will not be accepted. </p>
      <p>Self-quotations should be avoided.</p>
      <p>They must be normalized according to the ABNT current guidelines.</p>
      <p><b><i>Citations written in brackets</i></b></p>
      <p>With just one author: surname written with the first letter capitalized, 
        followed by a comma and the year of publication.</p>
      <p>Two authors: surnames written with the first letter capitalized, divided 
        by an ampersand (&amp;), followed by comma and year of publication.</p>
      <p>More than two authors: surname of the first author written in upper and 
        lowercase, followed by the expression et al., in a normal font, comma 
        and year of publication.</p>
      <p>More than one work: they must follow a chronological order, and, after 
        that, an alphabetical order of authors, and must be divided by semicolon.</p>
      <p>More than one work by the same authors: do not repeat the name of the 
        authors; commas divide the years of publication.</p>
      <p>Citation of citation: surname of the author and year of publication of 
        the original document, followed by the expression &#34;cited by&#34;, as well 
        as the citation of the work regarded.</p>
      <p>Citation of citation must be avoided because there is a chance of misinterpretation; 
        if it is essential, only the regarded work must comprise the references.</p>
      <p><b><i>Citations out of brackets</i></b></p>
      <p>With name of authors included in the sentence: they follow the previous 
        guidelines, with the years of publication in brackets; they are divided 
        by commas.</p>
      <p><b>Formulas, expressions, and mathematical expressions<br>
        </b>They must begin on the left margin of the page in a standard size 
        of Times New Roman font.</p>
      <p>They must not be in italics or in bold. Exceptions to the use of italics 
        would be formula symbols conventionally written in italics.</p>
      <p><b>Tables<br>
        </b>Tables must be sequentially numbered, with Arabic numerals, and presented 
        in separated sheets, </p>
      <p>at the end of the text, after the references. </p>
      <p>Tables should be self-explanatory, without the necessity to return to 
        the text to understand them. </p>
      <p>Essential elements: titles, headings, grid (columns and rows/lines) and 
        column indicating treatments and variables.</p>
      <p>Complementary elements: footnotes and bibliographical source.</p>
      <p>The title, followed by a period, must come after the word Table, in bold, 
        numbered sequentially in Arabic numerals. It must be clear, brief and 
        comprehensive; it must include the species name (general or scientific) 
        as well as the dependent variables.</p>
      <p>In the headings, the names of the variables must be written in full; 
        if this is not possible, explain the meaning of the abbreviations in the 
        title or footnotes of the table.</p>
      <p>Measure units of all variables must be presented using the International 
        System of Units. </p>
      <p>The columns of the data, numerical values must be aligned by the last 
        numeral.</p>
      <p>No table cell (crossings between lines and columns) may be empty. The 
        lack of numerical data should be represented by a hyphen (-), followed 
        by an explanation footnote. To indicate the minimum significant difference, 
        lowercase or uppercase letters are used in the columns or in the lines, 
        at the right of the data, with indication in the footnote of the test 
        and probability used.</p>
      <p>In order to separate headings from titles and from the table, use horizontal 
        borders; use them also on the base of the table to separate the content 
        from the complementary elements. Additional horizontal borders may be 
        used inside the headings and tables; do not use vertical borders.</p>
      <p>Tables should be assembled in Word files, using the menu Table; do not 
        introduce spaces using the space bar of the keyboard, but the indentation 
        on the menu format paragraph.</p>
      <p><b><i>Table footnotes</i></b></p>
      <p>Source notes: they indicate the origin of data on the table; sources 
        must be in the references.</p>
      <p>Indication notes: specific pieces of information about parts of the table, 
        in order to form an opinion about the data. They are indicated in Arabic 
        numerals, superscripted, in brackets, on the right of the word or number, 
        on the title, on the headings, on the table, or on the column. They are 
        continuous, without changing lines, separated by a period. </p>
      <p>To indicate significance, the indications ns (nonsignificant); *&nbsp;and&nbsp;** 
        (significant at&nbsp;5 and 1% probability, respectively) will be used. 
      </p>
      <p><b>Figures<br>
        </b>Charts, graphs, drawings, maps and photographs will be considered 
        figures to illustrate the texts.</p>
      <p>They should only accompany the text when necessary to explain the described 
        facts.</p>
      <p>The title of the figure, without bold, must come after the word Figure, 
        the number in Arabic numerals, and the period, in bold.</p>
      <p>Figures should be self-explanatory, without the necessity to return to 
        the text to understand them.</p>
      <p>Legends (key to the adopted conventions) must be included in the figure, 
        in the title, or between the figure and the title. </p>
      <p>On the graphs, the indications of the axes X and Y must have initials 
        in uppercase, and must be followed by the units in brackets.</p>
      <p>After the figure title, non-original figures must include the source 
        from which they were taken; sources must be in the references. </p>
      <p>Copyright to the author of photographs is mandatory, as well as the copyright 
        to the authors of drawings and graphs, which have required creative action 
        in their construction.</p>
      <p>To standardize units, font (Times New Roman) and size of letters in all 
        figures.</p>
      <p>Dots of curves must be represented by contrasting markers, such as: circles, 
        squares, triangles or diamonds (full or empty).</p>
      <p>Numbers that stand for the measures and respective signs must be out 
        of the quadrant.</p>
      <p>Curves must be identified in the figure, avoiding excess information 
        that interferes with the understanding of the graphs.</p>
      <p>Figures can not present data included in tables.</p>
      <p>They must be organized in such a way as to present the necessary quality 
        for good reproduction and measure 8.5 or 17.5 cm width.</p>
      <p>The figures must be saved in Word, Excel, or Corel Draw, in order to 
        make editing and corrections possible.</p>
      <p>Use borders with, at least, &#190; width.</p>
      <p>In the case of a graph of bars and columns, use a scale of proportional 
        gray (e.g.: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% for five variables).</p>
      <p>Do not use bold in figures.</p>
      <p>Photographs must have a resolution of, at least, 300&nbsp;dpi and be 
        saved in TIF files, separated from text files.</p>
      <p>Avoid using colours in the figures; photographs, however, may be coloured.</p>
      <p><b>Scientific Notes<br>
        </b>Scientific notes are brief communications, which justify immediate 
        publication, due to the fact that the finding is original and important, 
        but the content is still not enough to constitute a complete scientific 
        article.</p>
      <p><b><i>Presentation of Scientific Notes</i></b></p>
