<table BORDER="0" WIDTH="100%">
  <tr>
    <td WIDTH="15%"></td>
    <td WIDTH="70%"><p>Manuscripts should be in  English, preferably proofread by a native English speaker. Manuscript length  should not exceed 80 pages, including figures. In the case of longer  manuscripts, authors should consult the Editorial Board previous to submission.</p>
      <p> Manuscripts should be edited in Microsoft Word&reg;, on A4 size paper, double  spaced, and using Times New Roman font size12; the right margin should not  justified and the pages should be numbered consecutively. The font Times New  Roman should also be used for labeling figures and graphs. Only graphs and  tables should be incorporated to the text file, at the end.</p>
      <p> The main document should  have a title page containing the title and name(s) of author(s) followed by  number(s) for remission to the footnote. The footnote should contain the  complete address(es) of the author(s), including e-mail, and other pertinent  information, if necessary. Words entirely in upper case should not be employed,  except as indicated below. Author affiliations should be  presented in decreasing hierarchical order (e.g. Harvard University, Harvard  Business School, Boston, USA) and should be written as established in its own  language (e.g. Universit&eacute; Paris-Sorbonne; Harvard University, Universidade de  S&atilde;o Paulo). The ABSTRACT should have a maximum of 250  words, presented as one paragraph; KEYWORDS must be organized alphabetically and at most five  keywords. Words  already included in the title should not be used as keywords.</p>
      <p> Scientific names should be  followed by author and date of publication at the first mention of these taxa  in the manuscript. Genus- and species-group names must be written using&nbsp;<em>italics</em>.  Any other markings or signs as to emphasize or call attention should not be  used. The Editorial Board will decide on how to proceed for particular cases in  manuscripts of subject areas other than Systematics, Morphology and  Biogeography.</p>
      <p><strong>Text</strong>: All  citations in the text should refer to: 1. Single author: the author&rsquo;s name  (without initials, unless there is ambiguity) and the year of publication; 2.  Two authors: both authors&rsquo; names and the year of publication; 3. Three or more  authors: first author&rsquo;s name followed by &lsquo;et al.&rsquo; and the year of publication.  Citations may be made directly (or parenthetically). Groups of references  should be listed first alphabetically, then chronologically. Examples: &ldquo;as  demonstrated (Allan, 2000a, 2000b, 1999; Allan and Jones, 1999). Kramer et al.  (2010) have recently shown ....&rdquo;. The ACKNOWLEDGMENTS should be placed at the  end of the text, immediately preceding the REFERENCES. Authors are encouraged  to be succinct.</p>
      <p>&ndash; <strong>Illustrations:</strong> photographs, drawings, graphs and maps are  called figures and should be numbered consecutively (using Arabic numerals)  and, preferably, in the same sequence in which they are referred to in the  text. Scale-bars should be positioned either vertically or horizontally. Tables  (numbered with Roman numerals) should be presented in separate pages at the end  of the manuscript. If necessary, graphs may also be included in the main  document at the end. Illustrations files must be uploaded separately from the  main document, with at least 300 dpi for color images and 600 dpi for bitmap  and black and white images, in tiff or low compression jpeg format. Figure  numbers should be in Times New Roman font size 11 and positioned at the lower  right corner. Labeling applied to figures (numbers, letters and words) should  also be in Times New Roman and in an appropriate size in order that, after  reduction, they remain clearly visible without becoming more prominent than the  illustrations themselves. The Editorial Board can make small modifications or  ask the author(s) for a new plate. Figure legends should be included in the  main document.</p>
      <p><strong>Data references: </strong>This journal encourages  you to cite underlying or relevant datasets in your manuscript by citing them  in your text and including a data reference in your Reference List. Data  references should include the following elements: author name(s), dataset  title, data repository, version (where available), year, and global persistent  identifier. Add [dataset] immediately before the reference so we can properly  identify it as a data reference. This identifier will not appear in your  published article. [dataset] Oguro, M., Imahiro, S., Saito, S., Nakashizuka,  T., 2015. Mortality data for Japanese oak wilt disease and surrounding forest  compositions. Mendeley Data, v1. http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/xwj98nb39r.1</p>
      <p> Use the  following examples when preparing the REFERENCES section. They should be  arranged first alphabetically and then further sorted chronologically. More  than one reference from the same author(s) in the same year must be identified  by the letters &ldquo;a&rdquo;, &ldquo;b&rdquo;, &ldquo;c&rdquo;, etc., placed after the year of publication.  Examples:</p>
      <p> 1. Reference to  a journal publication: Van der Geer, J., Hanraads, J.A.J., Lupton,R.A., 2010.  The art of writing a scientific article. J. Sci. Commun. 163, 51&ndash;59.</p>
      <p> 2. Reference to  a book: Strunk Jr., W., White, E.B., 2000. The Elements of Style, fourth ed.  Longman, New York.</p>
      <p> 3. Reference to  a chapter in an edited book: Mettam, G.R., Adams, L.B., 2009. How to prepare an  electronic version of your article, in: Jones, B.S., Smith, R.Z. (Eds.),  Introduction to the Electronic Age. E- Publishing Inc., New York, pp. 281&ndash;304.</p>
      <p> 4. Internet  sites. Gilligan, T.M., Baixeras, J., Brown J.W., Tuck, K.R., 2012. T@RTS:  Online World Catalogue of the Tortricidae (Ver. 2.0). Available at:  http://www.tortricid. net/catalogue.asp. (accessed 25 Nov 2014).<br>
        Citations of  meeting abstracts and unpublished theses and dissertations should be avoided.</p>
      <p>  <strong>Short Communications</strong>: &nbsp;Short notes must report  elaborated work that incorporates the same aspects required for full articles  (biology, ecology, behavior, systematics, pest management, etc.). Manuscripts  of anecdotal nature will not be accepted. Papers that merely report new  geographic occurrences, records of species or host associations to new  localities in geographical regions that they are already known will not be  considered. Short Communications should be prepared as a single text and  references, including also an Abstract and Keywords. Do not include subtitles  (Introduction, Material and Methods, and Results and Discussion). Figures and  tables will be limited to a maximum of 3 objects per manuscript. <strong>Important</strong>: RBE will consider the  limited number of two Short Communications per issue.</p>
      <p>  <strong>Voucher policy:</strong> RBE encourages authors to deposit voucher and  type specimens in public museums or permanent University collections. It is  advisable that authors, at time of submission, clearly state in the manuscript  where their material is expected to be deposited. Labeling and proper  indication of voucher specimens are the author's responsibility.</p>
      <strong>Author&rsquo;s responsibility</strong>:&nbsp; Page proofs are sent  to the corresponding author and should be returned, with the necessary  corrections, at the indicated deadline. Authors are entirely responsible for the  scientific content of the paper, as well as for proper use of grammar. Authors are encouraged to look at the latest  issues of the RBE to check current format and layout. When submitting the  manuscript, the author may suggest  potential reviewers. Please, include the complete name, mailing and electronic  addresses of suggested  reviewers. The choice of reviewers, however, remains with the Editors.</td>
