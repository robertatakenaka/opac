      dissemination of research results, and thus generate a greater exchange 

      of knowledge. This policy leads to dissemination, expansion of reading and 

      citation of scientific articles of an author.<br>

      The names, postal addresses and email addresses will be used strictly to 

      fulfill the purposes of the Journal of Agronomical Science Journal, not 

      available for other purposes. <br>

      <b>Peer Review Process</b><br>

      Articles submitted to publication will be sent at least to two ad hoc reviewers

      <p><strong>3.  Checklist - <em>Revista Ci&ecirc;ncia Agron&ocirc;mica</em></strong></p>
      <p>Aimed at facilitating  the process of  submitting an  article, the  Editorial Board of <em>Revista Ci&ecirc;ncia Agron&ocirc;mica</em>, has  developed a  checklist so that an author is  able to
      </p>
      <p>check all formatting of his own manuscript, <strong>BEFORE </strong>submitting it for publication.  The checklist was prepared in accordance with the rules of the <em>Revista Ci&ecirc;ncia Agron&ocirc;mica</em>. <strong>NEGATIVE</strong> answers to this checklist mean  that your article needs to be further tailored to the journal&rsquo;s guidelines, and  the submission of such articles will result in their return and subsequent  delay in processing.<br>
        <strong>POSITIVE</strong> answers mean that your article is in accordance with the guidelines, <br>
      resulting in greater speed during processing.</p>
      <p><strong>A. With  reference to the work</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Is  the work original?<strong></strong></li>
        <li>Does  the work represent a scientific contribution to the area of the Agricultural  Sciences?<strong></strong></li>
        <li>Is  the work being submitted exclusively to the <em>Revista  Ci&ecirc;ncia Agron&ocirc;mica</em>?</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>B. With  reference to formatting</strong></p>
     <ul>
  
        <p>4 Does  work which is ready to be submitted online, leave out the names of the authors?<br>

        7 Was  the 1 cm paragraph indentation defined in the paragraph format? Remember that  the journal does not accept paragraph indents using the &quot;TAB&quot; key or  &quot;space bar&quot;.<strong></strong>
        </li>
        <br>
      8 Is  the structure of the work in accordance with the set guidelines, i.e. is it in  the following order: title, title in English, authors, abstract in Portuguese  (resumo), keywords in Portuguese, abstract, key words, introduction, material  and methods, results and discussion, conclusions, acknowledgements (optional)  and references?<strong></strong>
      </li>
        <br>
      9 Does  the title contain no more than 15 words?<strong></strong>
      </li>
        <br>
      10 Do  the abstract in Portuguese (resumo) and the abstract in English each contain a  maximum of 250 words?<strong></strong>

        <br>
      11 Do  the keywords contain between three and five terms, begin with an upper-case  letter and are they followed by a period?<strong></strong>
      </li>
      <br>
        12 Does  the introduction contain current quotes that are related to the subject  discussed in the research? Does it have a maximum of 550 words?<strong></strong>
        </li>
        <br>

        </ol></p>
      </ul>
        
          <p><strong> C.</strong><strong> Comments:</strong></p>
          <ul>
          1 Remember that <strong>IF</strong> the  journal's guidelines are not followed precisely, your work will  not be processed.  It is best therefore, to delay  sending it in for  a few days to verify all the guidelines. Checking other works already  published in your area can help you address possible questions, and they can serve as models to follow (access to journals  can be found on the site <a href="http://www.ccarevista.ufc.br/busca" target="_blank">http://www.ccarevista.ufc.br/busca</a>).</li>
          <br>
            2 Should your answers all be in the <strong>AFFIRMATIVE,</strong> your work can be sent in with greater confidence.  If you still have  any <strong>NEGATIVE</strong> answers, your work will be returned, delaying the submission process.<br>
              <strong>Remember:</strong> If your work is returned for a second time due to non-compliance with  the guidelines, especially in the case of references, your submission will be cancelled and <strong>no refund</strong><strong> of the submission  fee will be made</strong>. It is  very important therefore, for authors to check carefully whether the article is in accordance with the standards required by the <em>Revista Ci&ecirc;ncia Agron&ocirc;mica</em>.</li>
            <br>
            3 Try  always to monitor the status  of your work on the journal&rsquo;s  site (<a href="http://ccarevista.ufc.br" target="_blank">http://ccarevista.ufc.br</a>) using&nbsp; the online system for article management.</li>
            <br>
            4 This checklist does not replace a technical review made  by the magazine,  and which will be undergone by  all articles  submitted.</li>
