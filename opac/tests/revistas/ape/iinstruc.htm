The critic language an past verbal tense must be used. The central part of the discussion is the results interpretation and its relationship with existing knowledge in order to achieve a conclusion. The discussion begins by explaining the limits of the results, as the limit is given by the chosen method. In the second paragraph stating the contribution of the results of this study and practical applicability for nurses.</li>
 <li><b>Conclusion -</b> written in a clear sentence, simple and straightforward showing compliance with the proposed objective. In case of more than one objective, there must be a conclusion for each one. No other comment should be included in the conclusion.</li>
 <li><strong>References -</strong> from scientific journals indexed in international databases, with a direct and relevant connection to the study subject (and consulted in full by the author), should be cited. References of printed and/or electronic documents must follow the Vancouver style, which was defined by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (<a href="http://www.icmje.org/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=pt-BR&q=http://www.icmje.org/&source=gmail&ust=1474990291518000&usg=AFQjCNHN7-xVRxD36PnP7NtDDCQedfw8mg">www.icmje.org</a>). Presentation of references must be made with normal (neither bold, nor italic, nor underlined) fonts, alignment with the left margin, and numbered in the same order as that of citations in the manuscript. Titles of articles must be translated into English (within square brackets) indicating the language of the text at the end of the reference. Titles of journals should be abbreviated according to the List of Journals Indexed in Index Medicus and International Nursing Index. The maximum number of 35 updated references (less than five years and indexed in international databases) should not be exceeded. Always consider currentness of any reference, because citation of recent studies in original articles is essential. References that cannot be recovered in the original language by the reader, support material (dictionaries, statistics, laws, annals, etc), inaccessible sources (such as handouts, personal stuff, etc), or works of low scientific expression will not be published. Please, carefully check your references, as they contribute to convincing the reader of the validity of the facts and arguments in the article text.</li>
