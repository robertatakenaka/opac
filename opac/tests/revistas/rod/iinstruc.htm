    <td width="70%"><p>Rodriguesia  is an open acess journal. All the papers in the journal are available freely  with online full-text content. It publishes original  scientific articles, reviews, opinion and scientific notes in various areas of  plant biology (taxonomy, systematics and evolution, physiology, phytochemistry,  ultrastructure, cytology, anatomy, palynology, development, genetics,  reproductive biology, ecology, ethnobotany and phylogeography), the History of  Botany and topics related to Botanical Gardens.</p>
      <p>It's recommended that papers submitted to  Rodrigu&eacute;sia exceed the pure descriptive approach, revealing interpretation  related to morphology, ecology, evolution or conservation.</p>
      <p>Opinion or review articles may be accepted  through voluntary demand or at the request of the editorial board.</p>
      <p>Manuscripts should be prepared in  Portuguese, English or Spanish. Manuscripts submitted in English will be given  priority for publication. This Journal offers free immediate access to its  contents, following the principles of free availability of the woldwide  scientific knowledge.</p>
      <p>The Rodrigu&eacute;sia accepts manuscripts  provided that all authors have approved the manuscript submitted; the results  or ideas presented in the manuscript are original; the manuscript has not been  submitted to another journal, unless the manuscript has been refused by that  other journal or the author asks that other journal to withdraw the manuscript  from the submission process; the manuscript has been prepared in agreement with  the latest version of the Guidelines for Publication in Rodrigu&eacute;sia.</p>
      <p>If accepted and published, the article (or  its parts) cannot be published elsewhere, except with the consent of the  Editor-in-chief; the reproduction and proper use can not receive any profit,  presenting educational purposes only. Any other cases must be examined by the  Editor-in-chief.</p>
      <p>The  scientific content, grammar and spelling within an article are the sole  responsibility of its author. </p>
      <p><b>Peer Review Process</b></p>
      <p>Original papers submitted to Rodrigu&eacute;sia  will be evaluated by the Editor-in-chief and assistant editors, in order to  define its specific area; then the manuscript will be sent to the Area-editor,  who will send it to two ad hoc reviewers. Comments and suggestions of reviewers  and the Area-editor decision will be sent back to the authors for any eventual  modification of format and/or content. After the manuscript is approved, the  complete text with comments from reviewers and Area-editor will be evaluated by  the Editor-in-chief. Only the Editor-in-chief may, exceptionally, change the  recommendations made by the Area-editor and reviewers, always informing the  authors.</p>
      <p>An electronic proof will be sent by e-mail  to the corresponding author, for his approval. This will have to be returned in  up to five working days from receivership, to the Editorial-board of the  Journal.</p>
      <p>Manuscripts that do not follow the norms  below will be returned.</p>
      <p>Following  their publication, the articles will be available digitally (PDF, AdobeAcrobat)  on this site. We will also provide 10 offprints of each published article.</p></td>

All pages  (except the first one &ndash; title) must be numbered on the right hand corner.  Capital letters to be used only if the words are correctly spelled with  capital. Manuscripts written in capital letters will not be accepted. Words in  Latin must appear in italic type-face (incl. genus and species names). Complete  scientific names (genus, species and author) are to be used the first time they  appear in the text, abbreviating the generic name subsequently (unless this  could be a source of confusion) and not citing the author. Author&rsquo;s names  should be cited according Brummitt &amp; Powell (1992) &ldquo;Authors of Plant Names&rdquo;  or according to the IPNI website (<a href="http://www.ipni.org" target="_blank">www.ipni.org</a>).</p>
      <p><strong>First page</strong> &ndash; must  include the title, authors, institutes, financial support, address of  corresponding author and abbreviated title. The title has to be concise nd  objective, expressing the general idea of the contents. Title should appear in  bold with capital letters only where needed.</p>
      <p><strong>Second  page</strong> &ndash; must  have Abstract (including title in English), Resumo (including title in  Portuguese or Spanish) and key words (up to five, in English, Portuguese or Spanish,  in alphabetic order). Abstracts and Resumos must contain up to 200 words.</p>
      <p><strong>Text </strong>&ndash; To be  started on a new page, organized under the following sections: Introduction,  Material and Methods, Results, Discussion, Acknowledgements and References.</p>
      <p> When appropriate, the Results may be amalgamated with the Discussion.</p>
      <p> Titles and subtitles must be in bold.</p>
      <p> Figures and tables to be numbered in arabic according with their appearance in  the text.</p>
      <p> Reference citations should follow the examples: Miller (1993), Miller &amp;  Maier (1994), Baker <em>et al</em>. (1996) for three or more authors; or  (Miller 1993), (Miller &amp; Maier 1994), (Baker <em>et al</em>. 1996), (Miller  1993; Miller &amp; Maier 1994). Papers form the same author or sequence of  citations must appear in chronological order.<br>
        Citation of thesis or dissertations to be kept to the strict necessary. Work  presented in conferences, meetings and symposia should not be cited.</p>
      <p> Examined material in taxonomic papers must follow the order: place and  collecting date, buds, fl. or fr. (for phenology), name and collector number  (using et al. when more than two collectors are cited) and herbarium acronym(s)  between parenthesis, following Index Herbariorum (Thiers, continuously updated  ). When there is no collector number, the herbarium number of the specimen,  together with the herbarium acronym, should be cited. Countries and  state/province names should be cited in full, in capital letters and in  alphabetic order, followed by the respective records.</p>
      <p> Example: BRASIL. BAHIA: Ilh&eacute;us,  Reserva da CEPEC, 15.XII.1996, fl. e fr., <em>R.C. Vieira et al. 10987</em> (MBM, RB, SP).</p>
      <p> Decimal numbers should be separated by comma in papers in  Portuguese and Spanish (e.g. 10,5 m) and full stop in papers in English (e.g.  10.5 m). Separate values from their units with a space (except in percentages,  degrees, minutes and seconds). Use abbreviations for metric units from the  international System - Systeme Internacional d&acute;Unit&eacute;s (SI) and widely accepted  chemical symbols. Other abbreviations may be used as far as preceeded by their  full meaning in their first mention.</p>
      <p><strong>Figures -</strong> Maps,  drawings, graphs and photos are to be classified as figures. Photos and drawings belonging to the same figure must be organized in plates  (e.g.: Fig. 1a-d &ndash; Meaning that the figure 1 has four pictures or drawings).  All figures must be cited in order of appearance and must never be included in  the text file.</p>
      <p> Plates must have 15 cm wide x 19 cm tall (maximum height allowed); figures to  fit a single column are also accepted (i.e. 7.2 cm wide x 19 cm tall).</p>
      <p> Graphs must be presented in black and white.</p>
      <p> Figure citation in the text must be as follows: &ldquo;When analysing Figures 25 and  26....&rdquo; &ldquo;Lindman (Fig. 3a) highlighted the following characters for the  species...&rdquo;</p>
      <p><strong>Sending images to the journal:</strong></p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>INICIAL STAGE - electronic submission </strong>(<a href="https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/rod-scielo" target="_blank">https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/rod-scielo</a>): the images must be submitted       as PDF or JPEG files, not exceeding 2MB in size. Graphs must be sent in       Excel. If the file has been made in Corel Draw or other program, please       save it as a PDF or JPEG image. Illustrations lacking any readable data       will result on the return of the manuscript. </li>
      </ul>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>SECOND STAGE &ndash; only if the article is       accepted for publication</strong>: at this step all images must be sent to our journal through the       following options: </li>
        <ul type="circle">
          <li>to our address (available at our site) in        CD or DVD</li>
          <li>through an upload site according with the        preference of the author (we provide a link to a program called MediaFire        as an option for sending files, just click the button below). The author        must send an email to us announcing the availability of images on the        site, also informing the link to access the files.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com" target="_blank" title="Free File Hosting"><img border="0" width="80" height="15" src="/img/revistas/rod/iinstruc_clip_image001.gif" alt="MediaFire - Free File Hosting Made Simple"></a></p>
        <p> In this case, the images must be in TIF and have a  resolution of 300 dpi, according to the size indicated above. Graphs must be in  Excel or Corel Draw &nbsp;(up to version 12). <br>
          <br>
          IMPORTANT: We need to remember you that images (photos, drawings and bmp files  in general) cannot be sent inside any kind of Microsoft programs, but the  graphics which were made in Microsoft Excel. All the images need to have good  quality. If the original image has less than 300dpi resolution, it shouldn&acute;t be  transformed to a high resolution on programas like Photoshop. If the image has  small clearness, visibility or true type fonts in small size, the scanning of  these images has to be done again.</p>
        <p> Colour images will be published only in the  electronic-version.</p>
        <p> *** <strong>Always use the last published issue  to prepare your figures</strong>. ***</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>Captions</strong> &ndash; must  follow the file with the complete manuscript. Captions of figures or graphs in  articles in Portuguese or Spanish must have an English version.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Tables</strong> &ndash; not to be inserted within the text file. Include all  tables in a separate file. All must be in black and white, in Word for Windows  format. In the text, tables should be always cited according to examples below:  &ldquo;Only a few species present indumentum (Tab. 1)...&rdquo; &ldquo;Resultados of  phytochemical analysis are presented in Table 2...&rdquo; We request that the table  titles, in articles in Portuguese or Spanish, be accompannied by an English  version.</p>
      <p><strong>References</strong> &ndash; All references cited in the text must be listed under this item, in  alphabetical order of the surname of the first author, with only the first  letter of the surname in capital letter, followed by all other authors. If the  same author(s) published more than one paper in the same year, the date should  be followed by letters to indicate that. Journal titles should not be  abbreviated.</p>
