    <p>The Brazilian Journal of Otorhinolaryngology publishes Original Investigations,  Reviews, Letters to the Editor and Case Reports. Topics of interest include all  subjects that relate to the practice of medicine and the betterment of public  health worldwide.</p>
    <p><strong>Original Investigation</strong><br>
Original articles are concise (1) reports of clinical data, (2) reports of  basic science data, or (3) meta-analyses studies, that represent advanced  information, and for so, submission is encouraged by the Brazilian Journal of  Otorhinolaryngology editorial staff. These reports typically include randomized  trials, intervention studies, cohort studies, case-control studies,  epidemiologic assessments, other observational studies, surveys with high  response rates, cost-effectiveness analyses and decision analyses, and studies  of screening and diagnostic tests. Each manuscript should clearly state an  objective or hypothesis; the design and methods (including the study setting  and dates, patients or participants with inclusion and exclusion criteria  and/or participation or response rates, or data sources, and how these were  selected for the study); the essential features of any interventions; the main  outcome measures; the main results of the study; a discussion section placing  the results in context with the published literature and addressing study  limitations; and the conclusions and relevant implications for clinical  practice or health policy. Data included in research reports must be original  and should be as timely and current as possible. A structured abstract is  required. Number the pages of the manuscript consecutively, beginning with the  Title Page as page 1. For Full-Length Articles (original), the text should, in  general, not exceed 8-10 single-spaced typewritten pages. Please use a  spell-checker in addition to careful editing of the manuscript before  submission. Authors should not add line numbering as this is automatically  added by Elsevier Editorial System.</p>
    <p><strong>Reviews</strong><br>
      <em>Systematic Reviews</em><br>
Submissions of Systematic Reviews are highly encouraged by the BJORL editors.  They address a specific question or issue that is relevant for clinical  practice and provide an evidence-based, balanced, patient-oriented review on a  focused topic. Reviews should include the clinical question or issue and its  importance for general medical practice, specialty practice, or public health;  description of how the relevant evidence was identified, assessed for quality,  and selected for inclusion; synthesis of the available evidence such that the  best-quality evidence (e.g., well-conducted clinical trials, meta-analyses, and  prospective cohort studies) should receive the greatest emphasis; and  discussion of controversial aspects and unresolved issues. A structured  abstract is required.</p>
    <p><em>Literature Review</em><br>
The BJORL offers limited opportunity for literature reviews. Most will be by invitation.  It should be preferably focused on reviews of the evidence supporting the use  of a current technique, procedure, therapy, or diagnostic and clinical  approaches.</p>
    <p><strong>Case Reports</strong><br>
Case Reports describe encounters with one or several patients with unique or  unusual clinical situations. The key to an acceptable Case Report is the  identification of a clinical pearl or clinical wisdom that could benefit future  patients. The paper should contain:&nbsp;<strong>Introduction; Case Report;  Discussion; Conclusion; References</strong>. Word count: 1,100-1,500 words  (introduction-conclusion); References: 5-10; Figures/Tables: No more than a  total of 5 figures &lt;and tables; Multi-paneled figures will be counted as  multiple figures; Tables with &gt; 6 columns will be counted as multiple tables.</p>
    <p><strong>Letters to the Editor</strong><br>
Letters discussing a recent Brazilian Journal of Otorhinolaryngology article  should not exceed 400 words of text and 5 references, 1 of which should be to  the recent Brazilian Journal of Otorhinolaryngology article. They should be  double-spaced and a word count should be provided. Letters may have no more  than 3 authors. The text should include the full name, academic degrees, and a  single institutional affiliation for each author and the e-mail address for the  corresponding author. Letters must not duplicate other material published or  submitted for publication and should not include unpublished data. Letters not  meeting these specifications are generally not considered. Letters will be  published at the discretion of the editors and are subject to abridgement and  editing for style and content.</p>
    <p><strong>Letter in Reply</strong><br>
Replies by authors should not exceed 500 words of text and 65 references. They  should have no more than 3 authors.</p>
    <p><strong>Editorials</strong><br>
Editorials provide a forum for interpretive, analytical, or reflective opinions  related to manuscripts in the BJORL or statements about clinical, scientific,  or socioeconomic issues. The invitation-only Editorial should be objective and  dispassionate, but is likely to provide alternative points of view and some  bias. Editorials should not exceed 1,200 words with no more than 5 references.  Editorials do not have an Abstract.</p>
    <p><strong>before you begin</strong></p>
    <p>Only those who  actually participated in the study must be declared authors. Other means of  mentioning may be used at the end of the paper. A paper with more than 7  authors will only be accepted if the topic is multidisciplinary in nature or  involving basic sciences.</p>
    <p>References must be  pertinent and updated. The Journal accepts a maximum of 50 references for  original and review papers, and 10 references for case reports </p>
    <p><strong><em>Ethics in publishing</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><br>
For information on Ethics in publishing and Ethical guidelines for journal  publication see <a href="http://www.elsevier.com/about/publishing-guidelines/publishing-ethics" target="_blank">http://www.elsevier.com/publishingethics</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.elsevier.com/journal-authors/ethics" target="_blank">http://www.elsevier.com/journal-authors/ethics</a>.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Human and animal rights</em></strong>&nbsp;<br>
If the work involves the use of animal or human subjects, the author should  ensure that the work described has been carried out in accordance with The Code  of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) for  experiments involving humans&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/b3/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/b3/index.html</a>;  EU Directive 2010/63/EU for animal experiments&nbsp;<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/lab_animals/legislation_en.htm" target="_blank">http://ec.europa.eu/environment/chemicals/lab_animals/legislation_en.htm</a>;  Uniform Requirements for manuscripts submitted to Biomedical journals&nbsp;<a href="http://www.icmje.org" target="_blank">http://www.icmje.org</a>.  Authors should include a statement in the manuscript that informed consent was  obtained for experimentation with human subjects. The privacy rights of human  subjects must always be observed.</p>
    <p><strong>Identification of Patients  (Descriptions, Photographs, Pedigrees)</strong><br>
A signed statement of informed consent to publish (in print and online) patient  descriptions, photographs, and pedigrees should be obtained from all persons  (parents or legal guardians for minors) who can be identified (including by the  patients themselves) in such written descriptions, photographs, or pedigrees  and should be submitted with the manuscript. Such persons should be offered the  opportunity to see the manuscript before its submission. Omitting data or  making data less specific to deidentify patients is acceptable, but changing  any such data are not acceptable. Only those details essential for  understanding and interpreting a specific case report or case series should be  provided. Although the degree of specificity needed will depend on the context  of what is being reported, specific ages, race/ethnicity, and other  sociodemographic details should be presented only if clinically or  scientifically relevant and important. Cropping of photographs to remove  identifiable personal features that are not essential to the clinical message  may be permitted as long as the photographs are not otherwise altered. Please  do not submit masked photographs of patients. Patients&rsquo; initials or other  personal identifiers may not appear in an image.</p>
    <p><strong>Animal experimentation)</strong><br>
For experimental investigations of animal subjects, specify in the &ldquo;Methods&rdquo;  section of the manuscript what animal-handling protocols were followed, eg,  &ldquo;Institutional guidelines regarding animal experimentation were followed.&rdquo; For  those investigators who do not have formal ethics review committees (institutional  or regional), the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki should be  followed.&lt; P&gt;<strong>Personal  communications and unpublished data</strong><br>
A signed statement of permission should be included from each individual  identified as a source of information in a personal communication or as a  source for unpublished data, and the date of communication and whether the  communication was written or oral should be specified. Personal communications  should not be included in the list of references.</p>
    <p><strong>Previous release of  information</strong><br>
A complete manuscript following presentation at a meeting or publication of  preliminary findings elsewhere (eg, an abstract) is eligible for consideration  for publication. Authors considering presenting or planning to present the work  at an upcoming scientific meeting should indicate the name and date of the  meeting on the manuscript submission form. For accepted papers, the editors may  be able to coordinate publication with the meeting presentation. Authors who  present information contained in a manuscript that is under consideration by  the Elsevier during scientific or clinical meetings should not distribute  complete reports (ie, copies of manuscripts) or full data presented as tables  and figures to conference attendees or journalists. Publication of abstracts in  print and online conference proceedings, as well as posting of slides or videos  from the scientific presentation on the meeting website, is acceptable.  However, for manuscripts under consideration by the Elsevier, publication of  full reports in proceedings or online, issuing detailed news releases reporting  the results of the study, or participation in formal news conferences will  jeopardize chances for publication of the submitted manuscript in the Elsevier.  Media coverage of presentations at scientific meetings will not jeopardize  consideration, but direct release of information through press releases or news  media briefings may preclude consideration by the Elsevier.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Conflict of interest</em></strong>&nbsp;<br>
All authors must disclose any financial and personal relationships with other  people or organizations that could inappropriately influence (bias) their work.  Examples of potential conflicts of interest include employment, consultancies,  stock ownership, honoraria, paid expert testimony, patent  applications/registrations, and grants or other funding. If there are no  conflicts of interest then please state this: 'Conflicts of interest: none'.  See also <a href="http://www.elsevier.com/?a=163717" target="_blank">http://www.elsevier.com/conflictsofinterest</a>.  Further information and an example of a Conflict of Interest form can be found  at:&nbsp;<a href="http://help.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/286/p/7923" target="_blank">http://help.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/286/p/7923</a>.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Corresponding author</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><br>
The corresponding author will be the representative of all coauthors as the  primary correspondent with the editorial office during the submission and  review process. If the manuscript is accepted, the corresponding author will  review an edited typescript and proof, make decisions regarding release of  information in the manuscript to the news media, federal agencies, or both, and  will be identified as the corresponding author in the published article. The  corresponding author is responsible for ensuring that the reported conflict of  interest disclosures are accurate, up-to-date, and consistent with the  information provided for each author.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Submission declaration and verification</em></strong>&nbsp;<br>
Submission of an article implies that the work described has not been published  previously (except in the form of an abstract or as part of a published lecture  or academic thesis or as an electronic preprint, see <a href="http://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/article-posting-policy" target="_blank">http://www.elsevier.com/sharingpolicy</a>),  that it is not under consideration for publication elsewhere, that its  publication is approved by all authors and tacitly or explicitly by the  responsible authorities where the work was carried out, and that, if accepted,  it will not be published elsewhere in the same form, in English or in any other  language, including electronically without the written consent of the  copyright-holder. To verify originality, your article may be checked by the  originality detection service CrossCheck&nbsp;<a href="http://www.elsevier.com/editors/perk/plagiarism-detection" target="_blank">http://www.elsevier.com/editors/plagdetect</a>.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Authorship</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><br>
All authors should have made substantial contributions to all of the following:  (1) the conception and design of the study, or acquisition of data, or analysis  and interpretation of data, (2) drafting the article or revising it critically  for important intellectual content, (3) final approval of the version to be  submitted.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Changes to authorship</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><br>
This policy concerns the addition, deletion, or rearrangement of author names  in the authorship of accepted manuscripts:<br>
<em>Before the accepted manuscript is published in an online  issue</em>: Requests to add or remove an author, or to rearrange the  author names, must be sent to the Journal Manager from the corresponding author  of the accepted manuscript and must include: (a) the reason the name should be  added or removed, or the author names rearranged and (b) written confirmation  (e-mail, fax, letter) from all authors that they agree with the addition,  removal or rearrangement. In the case of addition or removal of authors, this  includes confirmation from the author being added or removed. Requests that are  not sent by the corresponding author will be forwarded by the Journal Manager  to the corresponding author, who must follow the procedure as described above.  Note that: (1) Journal Managers will inform the Journal Editors of any such  requests and (2) publication of the accepted manuscript in an online issue is  suspended until authorship has been agreed.<br>
<em>After the accepted manuscript is published in an online  issue</em>: Any requests to add, delete, or rearrange author names in an  article published in an online issue will follow the same policies as noted  above and result in a corrigendum.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Clinical trial results</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><br>
In line with the position of the International Committee of Medical Journal  Editors, the journal will not consider results posted in the same clinical  trials registry in which primary registration resides to be prior publication  if the results posted are presented in the form of a brief structured (less  than 500 words) abstract or table. However, divulging results in other  circumstances (e.g., investors' meetings) is discouraged and may jeopardise  consideration of the manuscript. Authors should fully disclose all posting in  registries of results of the same or closely related work.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Protocols</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><br>
Authors of manuscripts reporting clinical trials are encouraged to submit trial  protocols (including the complete statistical analysis plan) along with their manuscripts.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Registration of clinical trials</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><br>
Registration in a public trials registry is a condition for publication of  clinical trials in this journal in accordance with International Committee of  Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.icmje.org/" target="_blank">http://www.icmje.org</a>)  recommendations. Trials must register at or before the onset of patient  enrolment. The clinical trial registration number should be included at the end  of the abstract of the article. A clinical trial is defined as any research  study that prospectively assigns human participants or groups of humans to one  or more health-related interventions to evaluate the effects of health  outcomes. Health-related interventions include any intervention used to modify  a biomedical or health-related outcome (for example drugs, surgical procedures,  devices, behavioural treatments, dietary interventions, and process-of-care  changes). Health outcomes include any biomedical or health-related measures  obtained in patients or participants, including pharmacokinetic measures and  adverse events. Purely observational studies (those in which the assignment of  the medical intervention is not at the discretion of the investigator) will not  require registration.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Copyright</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><br>
Upon acceptance of an article, authors will be asked to complete a 'Journal  Publishing Agreement' to assign to the society the copyright in the manuscript  and any tables, illustrations or other material submitted for publication as  part of the manuscript (the &quot;Article&quot;) in all forms and media  (whether now known or later developed), throughout the world, in all languages,  for the full term of copyright, effective when the Article is accepted for  publication.</p>

    <p><strong>Double-blind review</strong>&nbsp;<br>
This journal uses double-blind review, which means that both the reviewer and  author name(s) are not allowed to be revealed to one another for a manuscript  under review. The identities of the authors are concealed from the reviewers,  and vice versa. For more information please refer to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.elsevier.com/reviewers/peer-review" target="_blank">http://www.elsevier.com/reviewers/peer-review</a>.  To facilitate this, please include the following separately:<br>
<em>Title page (with author details):</em>&nbsp;This should include the title,  authors' names and affiliations, and a complete address for the corresponding  author including an e-mail address.<br>
<em>Blinded manuscript (no author details):</em>&nbsp;The main body of the paper (including  the references, figures, tables and any Acknowledgements) should not include  any identifying information, such as the authors' names or affiliations.</p>
    <p><strong>Use of word processing  software</strong>&nbsp;<br>
It is important that the file be saved in the native format of the word  processor used. The text should be in single-column format. Keep the layout of  the text as simple as possible. Most formatting codes will be removed and  replaced on processing the article. In particular, do not use the word  processor's options to justify text or to hyphenate words. However, do use bold  face, italics, subscripts, superscripts etc. When preparing tables, if you are  using a table grid, use only one grid for each individual table and not a grid  for each row. If no grid is used, use tabs, not spaces, to align columns. The  electronic text should be prepared in a way very similar to that of  conventional manuscripts (see also the Guide to Publishing with Elsevier:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.elsevier.com/journal-authors/home#prepare-your-paper" target="_blank">http://www.elsevier.com/guidepublication</a>).  Note that source files of figures, tables and text graphics will be required  whether or not you embed your figures in the text. See also the section on  Electronic artwork.&nbsp;<br>
To avoid unnecessary errors you are strongly advised to use the 'spell-check'  and 'grammar-check' functions of your word processor.</p>
    <p><strong>Article structure</strong> </p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Introduction</em></strong>&nbsp;<br>
      State the objectives of the work and provide an adequate background, avoiding a  detailed literature survey or a summary of the results.</p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Methods</em></strong>&nbsp;<br>
      Provide sufficient detail to allow the work to be reproduced. Methods already  published should be indicated by a reference: only relevant modifications  should be described.</p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Results</em></strong>&nbsp;<br>
      Results should be clear and concise.</p>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Discussion</em></strong>&nbsp;<br>

    <p><strong><em>Conclusions</em></strong>&nbsp;<br>
    The main conclusions of the study may be presented in a short Conclusions  section, which may stand alone or form a subsection of a Discussion or Results  and Discussion section.</p>

    <p>•&nbsp;<strong>Title.</strong>&nbsp;Concise and informative. Titles are  often used in information-retrieval systems. Avoid abbreviations and formulae  where possible.<br>
•&nbsp;<strong>Author names and affiliations.</strong>&nbsp;Please clearly indicate the given  name(s) and family name(s) of each author and check that all names are  accurately spelled. Present the authors' affiliation addresses (where the  actual work was done) below the names. Indicate all affiliations with a lower-case  superscript letter immediately after the author's name and in front of the  appropriate address. Provide the full postal address of each affiliation,  including the country name and, if available, the e-mail address of each  author.<br>
•&nbsp;<strong>Corresponding author.</strong>&nbsp;Clearly indicate who will handle  correspondence at all stages of refereeing and publication, also  post-publication.&nbsp;<strong>Ensure that the e-mail address is  given and that contact details are kept up to date by the corresponding author.</strong><br>
•&nbsp;<strong>Present/permanent address.</strong>&nbsp;If an author has moved since the work  described in the article was done, or was visiting at the time, a 'Present  address' (or 'Permanent address') may be indicated as a footnote to that  author's name. The address at which the author actually did the work must be  retained as the main, affiliation address. Superscript Arabic numerals are used  for such footnotes.</p>
    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>&nbsp;<br>
A concise and factual abstract is required. The abstract should state briefly  the purpose of the research, the principal results and major conclusions, with  no more than 300 words. An abstract is often presented separately from the  article, so it must be able to stand alone. For this reason, References should  be avoided, but if essential, then cite the author(s) and year(s). Also, non-standard  or uncommon abbreviations should be avoided, but if essential they must be  defined at their first mention in the abstract itself. For original and review  articles, the abstract must be structured in: Introduction, Objective(s),  Methods, Results, and Conclusion(s).</p>
    <p><strong>Keywords</strong>&nbsp;<br>
Three to five keywords must be listed, and they can be found on MeSH (Medical  Subject Headings, <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/" target="_blank">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/</a>&nbsp;webcite).</p>
    <p><strong>Abbreviations</strong>&nbsp;<br>
Do not use abbreviations in the title or abstract and limit their use in the  text. Expand all abbreviations at first mention in the text.</p>
    <p><strong>Acknowledgements</strong>&nbsp;<br>
Collate acknowledgements in a separate section at the end of the article before  the references and do not, therefore, include them on the title page, as a  footnote to the title or otherwise. List here those individuals who provided  help during the research (e.g., providing language help, writing assistance or  proof reading the article, etc.).</p>
    <p><strong>Formatting  of funding </strong><br>
sources  List funding sources in this standard way to facilitate compliance to funder's  requirements: <br>
Funding:  This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health [grant numbers  xxxx, yyyy]; the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, WA [grant number  zzzz]; and the United States Institutes of Peace [grant number aaaa]. <br>
It  is not necessary to include detailed descriptions on the program or type of  grants and awards. When funding is from a block grant or other resources  available to a university, college, or other research institution, submit the  name of the institute or organization that provided the funding.</p>
    <p>If no funding has been  provided for the research, please include the following sentence: This research  did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public,  commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p>
    <p><strong>(Nomenclature and ) Units</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Units of measure</strong><br>
Laboratory values are expressed using conventional units of measure, with  relevant Syst&egrave;me International (SI) conversion factors expressed secondarily  (in parentheses) only at first mention. Articles that contain numerous  conversion factors may list them together in a paragraph at the end of the  &ldquo;Methods&rdquo; section. In tables and figures, a conversion factor to SI should be  presented in the footnote or legend. The metric system is preferred for the  expression of length, area, mass, and volume. For more details, see the Units  of Measure conversion table on the website for the AMA Manual of Style.</p>
    <p><strong>Names of drugs, devices,  and other products</strong><br>
Use nonproprietary names of drugs, devices, and other products, unless the  specific trade name of a drug is essential to the discussion.</p>
    <p><strong>Gene names, symbols, and  accession numbers</strong><br>
Authors describing genes or related structures in a manuscript should include  the names and official symbols provided by the US National Center for  Biotechnology Information (NCBI) or the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee.  Before submission of a research manuscript reporting on large genomic data sets  (eg, protein or DNA sequences), the data sets should be deposited in a publicly  available database, such as NCBI&rsquo;s GenBank, and a complete accession number  (and version number if appropriate) must be provided in the &ldquo;Methods&rdquo; section  of the manuscript.</p>
    <p><strong>Math formulae</strong>&nbsp;<br>
Please submit math equations as editable text and not as images. Present simple  formulae in line with normal text where possible and use the solidus (/)  instead of a horizontal line for small fractional terms, e.g., X/Y. In  principle, variables are to be presented in italics. Powers of e are often more  conveniently denoted by exp. Number consecutively any equations that have to be  displayed separately from the text (if referred to explicitly in the text).</p>
    <p><strong>Footnotes</strong>&nbsp;<br>
Footnotes should be used sparingly. Number them consecutively throughout the  article. Many word processors can build footnotes into the text, and this  feature may be used. Otherwise, please indicate the position of footnotes in  the text and list the footnotes themselves separately at the end of the  article. Do not include footnotes in the Reference list.</p>
    <p><strong>Artwork</strong></p>
    <p><strong><em>Electronic  artwork</em></strong>&nbsp;<br>
    <em>General points</em></p>
    <p>• Make sure you use uniform  lettering and sizing of your original artwork.&nbsp;<br>
• Embed the used fonts if the application provides that option.&nbsp;<br>
• Aim to use the following fonts in your illustrations: Arial, Courier, Times  New Roman, Symbol, or use fonts that look similar.&nbsp;<br>
• Number the illustrations according to their sequence in the text.&nbsp;<br>
• Use a logical naming convention for your artwork files.&nbsp;<br>
• Provide captions to illustrations separately.&nbsp;<br>
• Size the illustrations close to the desired dimensions of the published  version.&nbsp;<br>
• Submit each illustration as a separate file.</p>
    <p>A detailed guide on  electronic artwork is available on our website:&nbsp;<br>
      <a href="http://www.elsevier.com/author-schemas/artwork-and-media-instructions" target="_blank">http://www.elsevier.com/artworkinstructions</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>You are urged to visit this  site; some excerpts from the detailed information are given here.</strong><br>
      <em>Formats</em><br>
If your electronic artwork is created in a Microsoft Office application (Word,  PowerPoint, Excel) then please supply 'as is' in the native document format.&nbsp;<br>
Regardless of the application used other than Microsoft Office, when your  electronic artwork is finalized, please 'Save as' or convert the images to one  of the following formats (note the resolution requirements for line drawings,  halftones, and line/halftone combinations given below):&nbsp;<br>
EPS (or PDF): Vector drawings, embed all used fonts.&nbsp;<br>
TIFF (or JPEG): Color or grayscale photographs (halftones), keep to a minimum  of 300 dpi.&nbsp;<br>
TIFF (or JPEG): Bitmapped (pure black &amp; white pixels) line drawings, keep  to a minimum of 1000 dpi.&nbsp;<br>
TIFF (or JPEG): Combinations bitmapped line/half-tone (color or grayscale),  keep to a minimum of 500 dpi.</p>
    <p><strong>Please do not:</strong>&nbsp;<br>
• Supply files that are optimized for screen use (e.g., GIF, BMP, PICT, WPG);  these typically have a low number of pixels and limited set of colors;&nbsp;<br>
• Supply files that are too low in resolution;&nbsp;<br>
• Submit graphics that are disproportionately large for the content.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Color  artwork</em></strong>&nbsp;<br>
Please make sure that artwork files are in an acceptable format (TIFF (or  JPEG), EPS (or PDF), or MS Office files) and with the correct resolution. If,  together with your accepted article, you submit usable color figures then  Elsevier will ensure, at no additional charge, that these figures will appear  in color online (e.g., ScienceDirect and other sites) regardless of whether or  not these illustrations are reproduced in color in the printed version.&nbsp;<strong>For  color reproduction in print, you will receive information regarding the costs  from Elsevier after receipt of your accepted article</strong>. Please  indicate your preference for color: in print or online only. For further  information on the preparation of electronic artwork, please see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.elsevier.com/author-schemas/artwork-and-media-instructions" target="_blank">http://www.elsevier.com/artworkinstructions</a>.<br>
Please note: Because of  technical complications that can arise by converting color figures to 'gray  scale' (for the printed version should you not opt for color in print) please  submit in addition usable black and white versions of all the color  illustrations.</p>
    <p><strong>Illustration services</strong>&nbsp;<br>
Elsevier's WebShop (<a href="http://webshop.elsevier.com/illustrationservices/" target="_blank">http://webshop.elsevier.com/illustrationservices</a>)  offers Illustration Services to authors preparing to submit a manuscript but  concerned about the quality of the images accompanying their article.  Elsevier's expert illustrators can produce scientific, technical and  medical-style images, as well as a full range of charts, tables and graphs.  Image 'polishing' is also available, where our illustrators take your image(s)  and improve them to a professional standard. Please visit the website to find  out more. </p>
    <p><strong><em>Figure  captions</em></strong>&nbsp;<br>
Ensure that each illustration has a caption. Supply captions separately, not  attached to the figure. A caption should comprise a brief title (<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;on the figure itself) and a  description of the illustration. Keep text in the illustrations themselves to a  minimum but explain all symbols and abbreviations used.</p>
    <p><strong>Tables</strong>&nbsp;<br>
Please submit tables as editable text and not as images. Tables can be placed  either next to the relevant text in the article, or on separate page(s) at the  end. Number tables consecutively in accordance with their appearance in the  text and place any table notes below the table body. Be sparing in the use of  tables and ensure that the data presented in them do not duplicate results  described elsewhere in the article. Please avoid using vertical rules.</p>
    <p><strong>References</strong></p>
    <strong><em>Citation in text</em></strong>&nbsp;<br>
    Please ensure that every reference cited in the text is also present in the  reference list (and vice versa). Any references cited in the abstract must be  given in full. Unpublished results and personal communications are not  recommended in the reference list, but may be mentioned in the text. If these  references are included in the reference list they should follow the standard  reference style of the journal and should include a substitution of the  publication date with either 'Unpublished results' or 'Personal communication'.  Citation of a reference as 'in press' implies that the item has been accepted  for publication.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Reference  links</em></strong>&nbsp;<br>
Increased discoverability of research and high quality peer review are ensured  by online links to the sources cited. In order to allow us to create links to  abstracting and indexing services, such as Scopus, CrossRef and PubMed, please  ensure that data provided in the references are correct. Please note that  incorrect surnames, journal/book titles, publication year and pagination may  prevent link creation. When copying references, please be careful as they may  already contain errors. Use of the DOI is encouraged.</p>
    <p>A DOI can be used to cite and link to electronic  articles where an article is in-press and full citation details are not yet  known, but the article is available online. A DOI is guaranteed never to  change, so you can use it as a permanent link to any electronic article. An  example of a citation using DOI for an article not yet in an issue is: VanDecar  J.C., Russo R.M., James D.E., Ambeh W.B., Franke M. (2003). Aseismic  continuation of the Lesser Antilles slab beneath northeastern Venezuela.  Journal of Geophysical Research, http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2001JB000884i.  Please note the format of such citations should be in the same style as all  other references in the paper.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Web  references</em></strong>&nbsp;<br>
As a minimum, the full URL should be given and the date when the reference was  last accessed. Any further information, if known (DOI, author names, dates,  reference to a source publication, etc.), should also be given. Web references  can be listed separately (e.g., after the reference list) under a different  heading if desired, or can be included in the reference list.</p>
    <p><strong><em>References  in a special issue</em></strong>&nbsp;<br>
Please ensure that the words 'this issue' are added to any references in the  list (and any citations in the text) to other articles in the same Special  Issue.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Reference  style</em></strong>&nbsp;<br>
Authors are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of their references  and for correct text citation. Number references in the order they appear in  the text; do not alphabetize. In text, tables, and legends, identify references  with superscript arabic numerals. When listing references, follow AMA style and  abbreviate names of journals according to the journals list in PubMed. List all  authors and/or editors up to 6; if more than 6, list the first 6 followed by et  al. Note: Journal references should include the issue number in parentheses  after the volume number. Any articles that are not in English must be  translated. See Cumulative Index Medicus for abbreviating journal titles.<br>

    <p><strong>Proofs</strong>&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
One set of page proofs (as PDF files) will be sent by e-mail to the  corresponding author (if we do not have an e-mail address then paper proofs  will be sent by post) or, a link will be provided in the e-mail so that authors  can download the files themselves. Elsevier now provides authors with PDF  proofs which can be annotated; for this you will need to download Adobe Reader  version 9 (or higher) available free from&nbsp;<a href="https://get.adobe.com/br/reader/" target="_blank">http://get.adobe.com/reader</a>.  Instructions on how to annotate PDF files will accompany the proofs (also given  online). The exact system requirements are given at the Adobe site:&nbsp;<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/reader/system-requirements.html" target="_blank">http://www.adobe.com/products/reader/tech-specs.html</a>.&nbsp;<br>
If you do not wish to use the PDF annotations function, you may list the  corrections (including replies to the Query Form) and return them to Elsevier  in an e-mail. Please list your corrections quoting line number. If, for any  reason, this is not possible, then mark the corrections and any other comments  (including replies to the Query Form) on a printout of your proof and return by  fax, or scan the pages and e-mail, or by post. Please use this proof only for  checking the typesetting, editing, completeness and correctness of the text,  tables and figures. Significant changes to the article as accepted for  publication will only be considered at this stage with permission from the  Editor. We will do everything possible to get your article published quickly  and accurately. It is important to ensure that all corrections are sent back to  us in one communication: please check carefully before replying, as inclusion  of any subsequent corrections cannot be guaranteed. Proofreading is solely your  responsibility.</p>
    <p><strong>Offprints</strong>&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
The corresponding author, at no cost, will be provided with a PDF file of the  article via e-mail (the PDF file is a watermarked version of the published  article and includes a cover sheet with the journal cover image and a  disclaimer outlining the terms and conditions of use). For an extra charge,  paper offprints can be ordered via the offprint order form which is sent once  the article is accepted for publication. Both corresponding and co-authors may  order offprints at any time via Elsevier's WebShop (<a href="http://webshop.elsevier.com/myarticleservices/offprints" target="_blank">http://webshop.elsevier.com/myarticleservices/offprints</a>).
