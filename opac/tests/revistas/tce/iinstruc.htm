       <p> The review process involves the following phases:</p>
      <p> <strong>1. Reception</strong>. The editorial  office verifies the payment of the submission fee classifies the manuscript  according to the study type and forwards it for pre-analysis. </p>
      <p> <strong>2. Pre-analysis</strong>. The  editor-in-chief and the submission editors assess the manuscript for its  contribution to the body of knowledge, its advance on practice, teaching and/or  research in nursing and health, the methodological and structural quality of  the text and the compliance with the journal&rsquo;s editorial policy. We  remind authors of the importance of correctly applying spelling and grammar  rules in the writing. Manuscripts will be rejected immediately upon submission  if they do not meet these standards. We suggest that the manuscripts written in  Portuguese should be revised by a specialized professional before the first  submission. The  manuscript may be refused at this stage.</p>
      <p> <strong>3. Checklist</strong>. After the  pre-analysis, the editorial office checks all documents forwarded during the  online submission and the manuscript&rsquo;s compliance with the publication  standards. In case of non-compliance, the manuscript is returned to the  corresponding author for adjustments. After the checklist phase, no more than  two return submissions are accepted. In case the deadlines and recommendations  are not complied with after this period, the manuscript is rejected. At  this stage the payment of the evaluation fee of the manuscript will be  requested in order to give continuity to the analysis process.</p>
      <p><strong>3.1. Follow-up of  the manuscript evaluation process</strong><br>
      The authors will be able to follow the editorial flow of the manuscript in the  ScholarOne system. Decisions on the manuscript will be communicated by e-mail  and made available on the ScholarOne system.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Ad hoc review (<em>double blinded review)</em></strong>. After the checklist  phase, the manuscript returns to the submission editors, who select the  reviewers according to the activity area and theme. Then, the manuscript is  forwarded to the ad hoc reviewers. Two international  or brazilian reviewers  are  selected to assess the manuscript. The reviewers are invited through the <em>ScholarOne </em>system and, if they accept,  they receive the copy of the manuscript, the analysis tool and the link to  access the system. The review is blinded for the authors and institutions of  origin, as well as for the consultants.</p>
      <p><strong>5. Preliminary opinion</strong>. After  the two ad hoc reviewers return the manuscript, the selection editors and the  editor-in-chief assess their opinions and proceed through one of the possible  alternatives:</p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>5.1. Third reviewer.</strong> If  one of the reviewers indicates the manuscript for publication and the other  rejects it, the submission editors select a third reviewer, who opines on its  publication or not;</p>
      <p><strong>5.2. Rejection.</strong> If  the two reviewers reject the manuscript, the authors receive a letter  explaining the decision, together with the ad hoc consultants&rsquo; opinions;</p>
      <p><strong>5.3.  Indication for revision.</strong> If  the manuscript receives two positive opinions, the selection editors proceed  with the review, considering the relevance of criticism and any other problems  the reviewers may not have detected. The authors receive a letter to explain  the adaptations needed to proceed with the publication process, together with  the opinions and the manuscript, in case any marks have been made in the original  text. The authors should only make the corrections requested. A maximum of  two return revisions is accepted to comply with the requirements for  publication. If the authors do not attend to the requested, the manuscript is  rejected. </p>
      <p><strong>5.4. Indication of acceptance</strong><br>
        After the selection editors have indicated the acceptance of the  manuscript for publication, the text is verified in terms of authenticity  through  software CrossRef Similarity Check - iThenticate. In case a high percentage of similarity with other  publications is detected, the journal may reject the  manuscript and return it to the authors. After applying the   software CrossRef Similarity Check - iThenticate, the author receives a letter to explain any need for acceptance,  reformulation or rejection. The  editorial conduct for cases of detected plagiarism follows the <em>Code  of Conduct and Best Practice Guidelines for Journal Editors</em> do <em>Committee on Publication Ethics </em>(COPE) (<a href="http://publicationethics.org/" target="_blank">http://publicationethics.org/</a>).</p>
      <p>All  manuscripts selected for publication are analyzed by the <strong><em>Texto &amp; Contexto Enfermagem</em></strong> librarian, who reviews all compliances with the journal's standards and  bibliographic references.</p>
      <p><strong>6. Text  and Layout</strong>. The analysis of the  selected manuscripts for publication is carried out by the text and layout  publishers and the editor-in-chief, who evaluate the quality of the final  version of each manuscript. <strong>At this  stage, if the publishers detect a serious problem in the text, the manuscript  may still be refused or completions and corrections may be requested.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>7. Composition of the issue</strong>.  After the text and layout phase, the Board of Directors analyzes the  manuscripts indicated for publication and selects the titles to be included in  each new issue.</p>
      <p><strong>8. Publication fee</strong>. After the  indication by the Board of Directors, the authors receive a letter that  indicates the final approval (<strong>in print</strong>),  together with the orientations to pay the publication fee and have the  manuscript translated.</p>
      <p><strong>9. Translation</strong>. <strong>Texto &amp; Contexto Enfermagem</strong> presents a group  of accredited translators, fully qualified, whose names are forwarded to the  corresponding author. That author is responsible for selecting the translator  responsible for providing the English translation of the final version  approved in  the text and layout stage. It is the authors’ responsibility to verify the quality of the  translation. The translators are responsible for forwarding the translated version  to the journal.</p>
    <strong>10. Publication</strong>. After the journal has  received the English version of the manuscript, properly verified by the  authors, the text and layout editors review the text and forward it for final  formatting, tagging and publication in SciELO gradually  through the continuous flow system until the number set by the editor-in-chief  is completed.</td>

      <p align="left"><strong>Types of manuscripts and scope</strong> </p>
      <p>Besides the original articles, which are prioritized in  peer review, experience  reports, reflections and literature  reviews are published.</p>
      <p align="left">  <strong>Original article: </strong>contribution to disseminate end results of  scientific research. The authors&rsquo; creativity and style in the manuscript format  will be respect, provided that the content addresses the introduction, methods,  results, discussion and conclusion. The&nbsp;<strong>introduction </strong>should be brief, define the research problem  and its importance, besides highlighting the knowledge gap &ndash; &quot;state  of the art&quot; and the study objectives. The <strong>method </strong>used should be defined, as well as the context/population  studied, the data sources and sample selection criteria, the analysis  processes, among others. These should be describe comprehensive and completely.  In qualitative research, the description of the analysis process should address  the details of the specific study steps, beyond the simple indication of the  type of analysis applied. The number of the Research Ethics Committee approval  protocol should be indicated, as well as the CAEE, and the information should  be included that the research was conducted in accordance with the ethical  standards required. The <strong>results</strong> should be described in a logical order.  When using illustrations (tables, figures and pictures), the text should  complement instead of repeat the content they contain. The <strong>discussion should be separated from the results </strong>and should contain  comparisons between the results and the literature, the authors&rsquo;  interpretation, the implications of the findings, the limitations and  implications for future research. New and important aspects of the study  should be emphasized. The <strong>conclusions </strong>should  respond to the study objectives, without deviating from the data found. No  bibliographic references should be cited. The total length of the article is  limited to 15 pages, including abstract, tables and figures and excluding the  references.</p>
      <p align="left">  <strong>Experience report:</strong> description of academic, care and community service experiences. The  content should address the introduction, method, experience results and  conclusion. Its length is limited to 10 pages, including the abstract, tables  and figures, and excluding the references.</p>
      <p align="left">  <strong>Reflection:</strong> article to express opinions or analyze aspects that can contribute to  go deeper into themes related to the health and nursing area. The content  should address the introduction, reflection and conclusion. Its length is  limited to 12 pages, including the abstract and excluding the references.</p>
      <p align="left">  <strong>Review: </strong><strong>Text &amp; Context Nursing</strong> accepts two types of  reviews (systematic and integrative). Its length is limited to 20  pages, including the abstract, tables, pictures and references:</p>
      <p align="left">        <strong>Systematic</strong>, with or without  meta-analysis, using a comprehensive, impartial and replicable literature  review; locates, assesses and summarizes the set of evidence from scientific  studies to obtain a general and reliable view on the estimated effect of the intervention (Higgins JPT,  Green S, editors. Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions.  Version 5.0.2. The Cochrane Collaboration; 2009);</p>
      <p align="left">  <strong>Integrative</strong>, conducted to  identify, analyze and summarize results of independent studies on the same theme.  Also combines data from theoretical and empirical literature, besides  incorporating a wide range of purposes: definition of concepts, reviews of  theories and evidences, and analysis of methodological problems in a particular  topic (Whittemore R, Knafl K. The integrative review: update methodology. J Adv  Nurs. 2005; 52(5):546-53). This type of review should include a section that  describes the methods used to locate, select, extract and summarize the data  and conclusions;</p>
      <p><strong>Publication guidelines and prior registrations</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong><em>Texto &amp; Contexto Enfermagem</em></strong> supports the clinical  trial registration policies of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the  International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), recognizing the  importance of these initiatives for the international registration and  dissemination of information on clinical trials in open access. Therefore, only  clinical research manuscripts that have received an identification number in  one of the Clinical Trial Registries validated by the criteria established by  WHO and ICMJE, and whose addresses are available on the ICMJE website, will be  accepted for publication. The identification number should be recorded at the  end of the abstract.</p>
<p align="left">Manuscripts submitted to the journal should follow  the journal’s editorial policy and the authors' instructions, which follow the  EQUATOR Network and the ICMJE Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts <strong>(<a href="http://www.icmje.org">http://www.icmje.org</a>).</strong><strong> </strong></p>

In the English and Spanish versions, translation studies and instrument  validation studies should preserve the instrument items in Portuguese, the  language in which the study was carried out.</p>
<p><strong>Authors and Acknowledgments</strong><br>
  <br>
  The concept of authorship adopted by <strong>Texto  &amp; Contexto Enfermagem</strong> is guided by the substantial contribution of each  of the individuals listed as an author, which concerns, above all, the design  and planning of the research project, the obtaining or analysis and  interpretation of the data, the writing and critical review. The number of  authors is limited to six. The possibility of including more authors in  multicentric studies will be examined by considering the pertinence of the  justifications presented.</p>
The inclusion of the names of authors whose  contribution is in disagreement with the above criteria is not justified and  may, in this case, appear in the Acknowledgments section at the end of the  manuscript. The inclusion of new authors will not be accepted after the  submission process has begun.
<p align="left">Possible mentions under  acknowledgements include institutions that somehow made possible the  development of the research and/or people who contributed to the study but did  not fulfill the criteria to serve as co-authors. Will be included at the end of  the manuscript after the final approval.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Copyright and Publication  Authorization </strong></p>
<p>Authors must assign the patrimonial copyrights of  the article to <strong>Revista Texto &amp;  Contexto Enfermagem</strong> by means of the Declaration of responsibility and  transfer of copyright signed by all authors (Supplemental files not for  review): according to model on the journal's website. </p>
<p>Manuscripts presented in events (congresses,  symposia, seminars, among others) may be accepted, provided they have not been  fully published in annals and have been authorized in writing by the event  organizer. Manuscripts previously published in foreign journals may be  accepted, provided it is approved by the Board of Directors of <strong>Texto &amp; Contexto Enfermagem</strong> and  authorized by the periodical in which the manuscript was originally published  in. This guideline is valid for complete articles, article excerpts and  illustrations. It is the responsibility of the authors to request this  authorization in writing.</p>
<p><strong>Conflict of interest</strong></p>
<p align="left">Public trust in the peer review process and the  credibility of published articles depend on how the conflict of interest is  handled during writing, peer review, and editorial decision making. Conflicts  of interest may be personal, commercial, political, academic or financial.  Financial relationships such as employment, consultations, possession of  shares, fees, testimony or expert opinion are more easily identifiable  conflicts of interest and have a greater chance of undermining the credibility  of the journal, authors and science itself. However, conflicts may occur for  other reasons, such as personal relationships, academic competition, and  intellectual passion.</p>
<p align="left">Authors are responsible for recognizing and disclosing  conflicts of interest that may influence their work so that the Board of  Directors can decide on the manuscript. When available, authors should report  financial support and other financial or personal connections to their work.  Financial or other relationships that may lead to conflicts of interest should  be reported by the authors in individual statements (automatic on the  ScholarOne system).</p>
<p align="left">The manuscript submitted to <strong>Texto &amp; Contexto Enfermagem</strong> for analysis must not have been  submitted or published simultaneously in another journal. If a simultaneous  publication or submission to another journal is identified at any stage of the  submission process, the manuscript will be rejected.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Ethical Considerations</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>Texto &amp; Contexto  Enfermagem</strong> follows the Code of Conduct and Best Practice  Guidelines for Journal Editors of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)  (<a href="http://publicationethics.org/">http://publicationethics.org/</a>).<br>

      <li>informative, concise and clear title, containing &ldquo;what&rdquo;, &ldquo;from whom&rdquo;,  city, acronym of the state, country, year of data collection, followed by a  full stop. The legend should be located above the table. Next, the size of the  study sample should be displayed between parentheses, preceded by the letter N. example: <strong>Table 1 &ndash; Distribution of female victims of  domestic violence according to age, color, marital status and education.  Salvador, BA, Brazil, 2014. (N=209)</strong></li>
      <li>the data should be separated correctly using lines and columns, so that  each piece of information is displayed in one cell;</li>
        <li>gridlines only below and above the heading and at the bottom of the  table. No gridlines at the sides of the table.</li>

      <p><strong>Citations  and references</strong><strong> </strong></p>
      <p> <strong>Citations in the text:</strong> <strong>indirect citations</strong> should contain the number of the reference they were taken from, esxluding the  name of the author. The punctuation (point, comma or semicolon) should appear  before the number in superscript, without any space between the final stop and  the citation number. Example: the workers also use non-verbal language.<sup>7</sup><br>
        When the citations from two or more authors  are presented sequentially in the reference (for example, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5),  superscript should be used, separated by a hyphen. Example: established the  principles of good administration, adopting the classical view of the manager&rsquo;s  functions.<sup>1-5</sup>
      </p>
      <p>  <strong>Direct citations</strong> (textual transcription) should be displayed  in the body of the text between inverted commas, indicating the reference  number and citation page, independently of the number of lines. Example: [...]  &ldquo;the West emerged in front of us like this infernal machine that crushes men  and cultures for unwise purposes&rdquo;.<sup>1:30-31</sup></p>
      <p>
        Verbatim citations from qualitative research  are displayed in italics, in the body of the text, identifying authorship  between parentheses and respecting anonymity. The identification of authorships  should be displayed <strong>without </strong>italics.  Example: [...] <em>involving students and professionals more in social projects,  getting to know the community problems more</em> (e7).</p>
      <p><strong>Footnotes:</strong> the text should contain three footnotes at  most, indicated by: * first note, ** second note, ***  third note.</p>
      <p>  <strong>References:</strong>&nbsp;<br>
        The references should be consecutively  numbered in the order in which they appear in the text for the first time, in  accordance with the Uniform Requisites of the International Committee of  Medical Journal Editors - <u><a href="http://www.icmje.org/ethical_1author.html" target="_blank">ICMJE</a></u>.

        There is no limit as to the number of  references in the manuscripts. </p>
      <p>Special attention is needed to: recent  references (preferably from the last five years); priority of references to  articles published in scientific journals; citations in English of references  available online in that language; restrict the use of references the reader  cannot recover in the original version and/or whose scientific impact cannot be  measures (dissertations, theses, course conclusion monographs, handouts,  annals, decrees and official publications) or works of limited scientific  expression. </p>
      <p>
        No reference needs to be made  to National Health Council Resolution 466/12, which establishes the guidelines  and regulatory standards for research involving human beings. </p>
      <p>
        All references should be  displayed correct and completely. The author(s) is(are) fully responsible for  the veracity of the information in the reference list.</p>
      <p> In case any bibliographic  reference management software is used (e.g.: EndNote), the authors should  convert the references into text.</p>
      <p><strong>Gray literature</strong>: citations of unconventional,  non-indexed, non-indexed, non-ISBNs, ISSN, ISAN or DOI publications should be  avoided (theses, dissertations, course papers, handouts, official publications).</p>
      <p>Manuscripts extracted from theses, dissertations  and TCCS should not cite the original work in the references. This information  should be entered on the identification page. </p>
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: Unpublished works should not  be included in the references but inserted in a footnote.
