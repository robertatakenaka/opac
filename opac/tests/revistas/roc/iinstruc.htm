      <p>MISSION STATEMENT
      <p>Its priority is to publish scientific studies on different populations 
        from Latin America and other developing regions as part of the global 
        initiative to record multi-ethnic diversity in oral health and foster 
        health equity worldwide. The Journal also seeks to publish articles on 
        new conceptual models, innovative technology, alternative procedures or 
        treatment to reduce disease burden in the general population or specific 
        groups, thus contributing to translating science into practice and social 
        development.</p>
      <p>Contributions falling into the following categories will be considered 
        for publication:</p>
      <p>1) original research reports of basic and applied oral sciences, epidemiological, 
        and education studies;</p>
      <p>2) review article; and </p>
      <p>3) case report.</p>
      <p>The Revista Odonto Ci&ecirc;ncia (Journal of Dental Science) welcomes manuscripts 
        written in English or Portuguese languages. Accepted manuscripts written 
        in Portuguese should be translated into English for publication. Manuscripts 
        submitted to this journal should not have been published before nor have 
        publication pending elsewhere.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>Peer Review Process</b></p>
      <p>The Revista Odonto Ci&ecirc;ncia (Journal of Dental Science) adopts a blind 
        expert peer review process.</p>
      <p>Contributions are sent to reviewers if they rigorously abide by the journal 
        guidelines. All submission and review process use an Open Journal System 
        version. The reviewers receive an e-mail with the abstract and login to 
        the online system, where they access the journal guidelines and steps 
        to send the review and recommendation to the editor. Authors and reviewers 
        are blind to each other. The submission version for review is a modified 
        PDF file of the original word file with removal or masking of all content 
        that could jeopardize the blind review process. The editorial board decides 
        whether or not to accept the article, taking into consideration originality, 
        significance and scientific contribution to the area.</p>
      <p>Expeditious review may be requested in the cover letter to the editor 
        and will be considered in selected cases, e.g., submissions related to 
        patents.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>Publication Frequency</b></p>
      <p>The Revista Odonto Ci&ecirc;ncia (Journal of Dental Science) is published 
        four times a year.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>Open Access Policy</b></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>Conflict of Interest Statement</b></p>
      <p>Conflict of interest exists when an author (or the author's institution), 
        reviewer, or editor has financial or personal relationships that inappropriately 
        influence (bias) his or her actions (such relationships are also known 
        as dual commitments, competing interests, or competing loyalties). </p>
      <p>When there is some relationship between the authors and some public or 
        private entity that could give rise to some conflict of interest, this 
        possibility should be made known on the title page of the manuscript and 
        in the initial letter of submission. </p>
      <p>In case there is no conflict of interest, the author should state so 
        (for example: "I declare that I do not have any commercial or associative 
        interest that represents a conflict of interest in connection with the 
        work submitted").</p>
      <p>All authors are required to provide a ICMJE Form for Disclosure of Potential 
        Conflicts of Interest and should complete a standard form, which is available 
        at <a href="http://www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf</a></p>
      <p>This form should be uploaded with the manuscript at submission as a supplementary 
        file (one for each author).</p>
      <p>Reviewers also are required to file a Conflict of Interest Statement 
        when reviewing a submission.</p>

        Medical Subject Headings of the U.S. National Library of Medicine or the 
        list of Health Siences Descriptors (DeCS) in BIREME.</p>
      <p>3. Text</p>
      <p>3.1 The original research article should be divided into the following 
        sections: Introduction, Methods (or Casuistics), Results, Discussion, 
        and Conclusions. </p>
      <p>- Introduction: This section should be objective and present the research 
        problem and background to justify the work and provide available data 
        on the subject of the study. The objective(s) and/or hypothesis of the 
        study should be stated in the last paragraph.</p>
      <p>- Methods (or Casuistics): This section should describe in a logical 
        order the population/sample or specimens, the variables and the procedures 
        of the study with sufficient detail so that it can be duplicated. Methods 
        already published and established in the literature should be briefly 
        described, and the original reference should be cited. Methods used for 
        statistical analysis should be briefly described at the end of the section.</p>
      <p>IMPORTANT:</p>
      <p>All research work that involves the study of human subjects should state 
        at the beginning of this section that the research was approved by the 
        institutional review board or ethics committee in accordance with national 
        and international guidelines and regulations, e.g., the Declaration of 
        Helsinki. The registration number of the research project in SISNEP/Brazilian 
        Ministry of Health or the document of approval from an internationally 
        comparable ethics committee should be sent as a supplementary file in 
        online submission (mandatory). Similarly, studies with other animals should 
        be approved by the appropriate institutional and/or licensing committee, 
        and the document of approval should be sent as a supplementary file.</p>
      <p>- Results: They should be written in the text in a direct manner, without 
        subjective interpretation. The results presented in tables and figures 
        should not be repeated in the text.</p>
      <p>- Discussion: This should present an interpretation of the results and 
        any contrast with the literature, a report of inconsistencies and limitations 
        of the findings, suggestions for future studies, and the practical application 
        and/or importance of the results. Inferences, deductions, and conclusions 
        should be limited to the findings of the study (conservative generalization).</p>
      <p>- Conclusions: They should be supported by the results and be consistent 
        with the objectives of the study.</p>
      <p>3.2 Case report: This type of manuscript should be divided into Introduction, 
        Case description, and Discussion.</p>
      <p>4. Acknowledgment: They should be brief and objective, to persons or 
        institutions that contributed significantly to the study, but that did 
        not meet the criteria for authorship. The financial support from the research-promoting 
        funding organization and the grant number should be mentioned in this 
        section. Previous presentation in scientific events may be mentioned here.</p>
      <p>5. References: The format of the references should follow the guidelines 
        of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (Vancouver Group).</p>
      <p>5.1 The references should be numbered in order of appearance in the text 
        and cited between parentheses: (1), (3,5,8), (10-15). </p>
      <p>In direct citations in the text, articles with two authors are cited 
        using the two names. For example: "According to Santos and Silva 
        (1)..." For articles with three or more authors, the first author 
        is cited followed by "et al." For example: "Silva et al. 
        (2) observed..."</p>
      <p>5.2 Cite a maximum of 25 references for an original research article, 
        15 for a case report, and 50 for a literature review.</p>
      <p>5.3 The list of references should be double-spaced, in numerical order. 
        The reference must be complete, including the names of all authors (if 
        seven or more authors, list up to six followed by "et al.").</p>
      <p>5.4 The abbreviations of the names of the journals cited should be in 
        accordance with PubMed or LILACS and BBO.</p>

      <p>Observations: The authors are responsible for the accuracy of all citations 
        and references. Please do not include summaries/abstracts, personal communications 
        or bibliographic materials without publication information in the list 
        of references.</p>
      <p>10. Tables: The tables should be constructed with the Table tool of Word 
        for Windows, numbered consecutively with Arabic numerals in the order 
        of mention in the text (for example: Table 1, Table 2, etc), and placed 
        on separate pages after the list of references. The title should be explanatory 
        and concise, double-spaced, and placed at the top of the table. All the 
        explanations should be presented in footnotes, identified by the following 
        symbols, in this sequence: *, &#134;, &#135;, &#167;, ||, **, &#134;&#134;, 
        &#135;&#135;. Do not underline or draw lines inside the tables, nor use 
        spaces to separate columns. Do not use a space on either side of the symbol 
        &#177;.</p>
      <p>11. Figures: Illustrations (photographs, graphs, charts, drawings, pictures, 
        etc.) should be considered as figures. They should be limited to those 
        absolutely necessary and numbered consecutively in Arabic numerals, following 
        the order in which they are cited in the text (for example: Figure 1, 
        Figure 2, etc). Figures should be included at the end of the manuscript, 
        after the list of corresponding legends typed on a separate page. All 
        explanations should be provided in the legends, including abbreviations 
        occurring in the figure. Individual files (high resolution, tif ou jpeg 
        format) should also be sent as supplementary files after the submission 
        window of the main text.</p>
      <p>11.1 Digital photographs and digitized images should be saved in tif 
        or jpg format, with a minimal resolution of 300 dpi and 8 cm in width.</p>
      <p>11.2 Letters and identification marks should be clear and defined. Critical 
        areas of radiographs and microphotographs should be presented separately 
        and/or outlined. Microphotographs should have internal scales and arrows 
        that contrast with the background.</p>
      <p>11.3 Separate parts of the same figure should be labeled A, B, C, etc. 
        Single figure and groups of figures should not exceed 8 cm and 16 cm in 
        width, respectively. </p>
      <p>11.4 Clinical photographs should not allow the identification of the 
        patient. In case there is the possibility of identification, it is obligatory 
        to send a written document providing signed informed consent for publication. 
      </p>
      <p>11.5 Figures reproduced from other sources already published should indicate 
        this condition in the legend, and should be accompanied by a letter of 
        permission from the copyright holder.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>AUTHORSHIP &amp; CONTRIBUTORSHIP</p>
      <p>The Revista Odonto Ciencia (Journal of Dental Science) adopts the ICMJE 
        Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals: 
        Ethical Considerations in the Conduct and Reporting of Research: Authorship 
        and Contributorship as follows:</p>
      <p>"Authorship credit should be based on 1) substantial contributions 
        to conception and design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation 
        of data; 2) drafting the article or revising it critically for important 
        intellectual content; and 3) final approval of the version to be published. 
        Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, and 3. </p>
      <p>When a large, multicenter group has conducted the work, the group should 
        identify the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript 
        (3). These individuals should fully meet the criteria for authorship/contributorship 
        defined above, and editors will ask these individuals to complete journal-specific 
        author and conflict-of-interest disclosure forms. When submitting a manuscript 
        authored by a group, the corresponding author should clearly indicate 
        the preferred citation and identify all individual authors as well as 
        the group name. Please list other members of the group in the Acknowledgments. 
      </p>
      <p>Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of 
        the research group alone does not constitute authorship. </p>
      <p>All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and 
        all those who qualify should be listed. </p>
      <p>Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take 
        public responsibility for appropriate portions of the content."</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>COPYRIGHT TRANSFER</p>
      <p>The submission of originals to the Revista Odonto Ci&ecirc;ncia (Journal of 
        Dental Science) implies the transfer of copyrights of the printed and

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT</p>
      <p>When there is some relationship between the authors and some public or 
        private entity that could give rise to some conflict of interest, this 
        possibility should be made known on the title page of the manuscript and 
        in the letter of submission. In case there is no conflict of interest, 
        the author should state so (for example: "I declare that I do not have 
        any commercial or associative interest that represents a conflict of interest 
        in connection with the work submitted").</p>
      <p>All authors are required to provide a Conflict of Interest Statement 
        and should complete a standard form, which is available at ICMJE Form 
        for Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest. </p>
      <p>This form should be uploaded with the manuscript at submission as a supplementary 
        file (one for each author).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>REGISTRATION OF CLINICAL TRIALS</p>
      <p>The Revista Odonto Ciencia (Journal of Dental Science) supports the policies 
        for the registration of clinical trials expressed by the World Health 
        Organization (WHO) and of the International Committee of Medical Journal 
        Editors (ICMJE), recognizing the importance of these initiatives for the 
        registration and international dissemination of information on clinical 
        studies, in open access. Therefore, articles of clinical trials should 
        have received an identification number from one of the Register of Clinical 
        Trials validated by the criteria established by the ICMJE and the WHO:</p>
      <p>ClinicalTrials.gov</p>
      <p>WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP)</p>
      <p>The identification number should be cited at the end of the abstract.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT</p>
      <p>"Patients have a right to privacy that should not be violated without 
        informed consent. Identifying information, including names, initials, 
        or hospital numbers, should not be published in written descriptions, 
        photographs, or pedigrees unless the information is essential for scientific 
        purposes and the patient (or parent or guardian) gives written informed 
        consent for publication. Informed consent for this purpose requires that 
        an identifiable patient be shown the manuscript to be published. Authors 
        should disclose to these patients whether any potential identifiable material 
        might be available via the Internet as well as in print after publication. 
      </p>
      <p>Nonessential identifying details should be omitted. Informed consent 
        should be obtained if there is any doubt that anonymity can be maintained. 
        For example, masking the eye region in photographs of patients is inadequate 
        protection of anonymity. If identifying characteristics are altered to 
        protect anonymity, such as in genetic pedigrees, authors should provide 
        assurance, and editors should so note, that such alterations do not distort 
        scientific meaning. </p>
      <p>When informed consent has been obtained, it should be indicated in the 
        published article."</p>
