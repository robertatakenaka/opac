    <td width="70%"><p><em>Contexto Internacional</em>&nbsp;is committed to publishing analytically strong and  theoretically original scholarship in International Relations and related  fields.&nbsp;<em>Contexto</em>&nbsp;is particularly suited for innovative,  investigative and exploratory articles that provide insight into the realities  and situated knowledges that stem from and around the Global South.</p>
      <p><em>Contexto  Internacional </em>is  published in English, three times a year. The editors invite submissions from researchers and  practitioners from all over the globe, especially  senior and junior scholars, and PhD students in the fields of International  Relations, Political Science and related fields. The journal accepts submissions of research  articles, review essays, book reviews, and proposals for special issues, especially proposals  centred on themes relevant to the problems and political processes  affecting the Global South and to the development of a more diverse  understanding of International Relations.</p>
      <p> Manuscripts may be submitted in English (the journal  language), French, Portuguese, or Spanish. Manuscripts are reviewed in the  language of submission. If the review process results in a decision to publish,  it is the responsibility of the author alone to translate the article into  English. Contexto reserves the right to reject articles if the level of English  is insufficient.</p>
      <p><em>Contexto Internacional</em>&nbsp;adopts a rigorous double-blind peer-reviewing policy.  The response from the first round of reviews will normally be provided within  120 days from the submission. Authors are expected to correct and return proofs  of accepted articles within 48 hours of receipt.</p>
      <p>Authors  should hold a PhD or be enrolled in a PhD program, and/or have a strong  professional/academic background in International Relations, Political Science  or related field at the time of submission. In co-authored manuscripts, at least one of the authors  should meet that criteria fully. The  editors will reject manuscripts before review if they are not suitable for the  journal, for example, because of low adherence to <em>Contexto&rsquo;s </em>editorial  policy and scope, inadequate or imprecise analytical development, inconsistent  formatting or non-compliance with our submission guidelines, and poor writing  style (this list is not exhaustive).</p>
      <p><strong>Publication Process</strong></p>
      <p><em>Contexto Internacional&nbsp;</em>adopts a rigorous six-phase  publication process, as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><em>Administrative checklist</em>: A submitted  manuscript is firstly evaluated in relation to its conformity to the technical  requirements of its corresponding type of submission. Technical requirements  include minimum and maximum number of words, mandatory files in appropriate  formats, among others (see the specific requirements to each type of submission  in the section Manuscript Format and Structure below).</li>
        <li><em>Preliminary evaluation</em>: Once a  manuscript has been approved by the administrative staff, it becomes subject to  a preliminary evaluation by the editors. This phase consists in the assessment  of a manuscript&rsquo;s adherence to the journal&rsquo;s editorial policy and scope, as  well as its overall quality. In cases of research articles, the failure to  attend to such requirements may result in the decision to immediately reject  the manuscript. Otherwise, the manuscript is assigned to external referees (see  phase 3 below). In rare occasions a research article may be immediately  accepted at this phase. Review essays and book reviews, on the other hand, are  fully evaluated by the editors at this phase. Five distinct outcomes may result  from the editors&rsquo; decision on these types of manuscripts: (1) Immediate Reject:  the review essay/book review is rejected in its current form; (2) Immediate  Reject and Resubmit (R&amp;R): the review essay/book review is rejected in its  current form, but the author(s) is/are encouraged to resubmit a comprehensive  revised version within 180 days; (3) Immediate Major Revision: the review  essay/book review is accepted with the condition that the author(s) meet(s) the  editors&rsquo; requests, and that a revised version is resubmitted within 60 days;  (4) Immediate Minor Revision: the review essay/book review is accepted with the  condition that the author(s) meet(s) the editors&rsquo; requests, and that a revised  version is resubmitted within 30 days; (5) Immediate Accept: the review  essay/book review is accepted in its current form. </li>
        <li><em>Double-blind peer-review evaluation:</em> Research  articles approved in the previous phases are then anonymously assigned to at  least two external referees at the discretion of the editorial committee.  Priority is given to referees with widely recognized production on the same  subject matter as the submitted research article. Following Contexto&rsquo;s  editorial policy, we strive to maintain a diverse geographical and gender  distribution of peer reviewers. The complete list of referees is published  every two years. The response from this first round of reviews will normally be  provided within 120 days from the date of submission. In cases of disparate  evaluation by peer reviewers, the manuscript is typically assigned to a third  referee. In cases like this, the timeframe of the evaluation process may be  extended by about 40 additional days. Based upon the external referees&rsquo;  reviews, an Associate Editor further evaluates the manuscript and commits a  final recommendation to the Editor-in-Chief.</li>
        <li><em>Editorial decision</em>: Five possible  editorial decisions may result from the overall evaluation process described  above: (1) Reject: the research article is rejected in its current form; (2)  Reject and Resubmit (R&amp;R): the research article is rejected in its current  form, but the author(s) is/are encouraged to resubmit a comprehensive revised  version within 180 days; (3) Major Revision: the research article is accepted  with the condition that the author(s) meet(s) both the referees&rsquo; and the  editors&rsquo; requests, and that a revised version is resubmitted within 60 days;  (4) Minor Revision: the research article is accepted with the condition that  the author(s) meet(s) both the referees&rsquo; and editors&rsquo; requests, and that a  revised version is resubmitted within 30 days; (5) Accept: the research article  is accepted in its current form. In cases of R&amp;R, Major Revision and Minor  Revision, the revised manuscript is submitted to a second round of evaluation  by peer reviewers and editors. The response will normally be provided within  120-160 days from the date of resubmission. </li>
        <li><em>Copy-editing</em>: Once a  manuscript is approved for publication, it goes through a thorough copy-editing  process for linguistic and stylistic revision. Proposed changes are normally  sent off for author&rsquo;s approval within 20-30 days from the manuscript approval  date. Authors are expected to meet the copy-editor&rsquo;s requests and return the  revised manuscript within 48 hours of receipt. This revision process may occur  more than once until a definitive version of the text is finally approved by  the editors.</li>
        <li><em>Proofreading and publication:</em> This phase  consists of creating and revising the PDF proofs of an accepted manuscript  until a final proof is approved, and subsequently published online and in  print. Authors are expected to correct and return proofs of accepted  manuscripts within 48 hours of receipt. The manuscript is normally published  online within 30 days from the proof approval date, and published in print  after 30 additional days.</li>
