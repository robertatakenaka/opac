Trends in  Psychiatry and Psychotherapy is a peer-reviewed, multidisciplinary journal that  assures rapid publication of current and original research papers and  authoritative reviews produced by expert national and international bodies. The  journal covers the broad spectrum of clinical psychiatry and basic science,  with a focus on the interaction between experimental and clinical research. Other  types of articles whose primary focus is to help translate fundamental  discoveries from basic science into the reality of clinical psychiatric  practice will also be considered (see types of articles accepted below). These  may include papers on psychological processes and behavior, neuropsychology,  psychopharmacology, clinical neuroscience, psychotherapy, and other areas of  relevance to one or more aspects of psychopathology and psychiatry.</p>
      <p>The journal is published  quarterly and is the official scientific publication of Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o de  Psiquiatria do Rio Grande do Sul (APRS, Brazil). The journal is fully open  access (<a href="http://www.scielo.br/trends" target="_blank">www.scielo.br/trends</a>),  and there are no publication fees. The journal&rsquo;s manuscript submission web site  is available at <a href="http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/trends-scielo" target="_blank">http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/trends-scielo</a>.  These instructions are based on the <a href="http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/">Recommendations  for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly work in  Medical Journals</a> published by the International Committee of Medical  Journal Editors (ICMJE).</p>
      <p>        <strong>Language </strong> <br>
        All manuscripts should be  submitted in English. Only manuscripts written in clear and understandable  language will be sent to peer review.</p>
      <p>  <strong>Peer  review process<br>
</strong>Manuscripts submitted  to Trends in Psychiatry and Psychotherapy are initially screened for plagiarism  (built-in tool available in the submission system) and evaluated with regard to  conformity with the journal&rsquo;s scope and editorial line. If the paper is in  accordance with the journal&rsquo;s editorial policies and with the present  Instructions for Authors, it will be submitted to review by at least two  reviewers selected by the editors; the reviewers remain anonymous throughout  the review process. Within 60 days, the authors are informed of either the  acceptance, rejection, or need for revisions in the article, as requested by  the Editorial Board. A decision letter and the reviewers&rsquo; comments are emailed  to the authors. Authors are requested to return revised manuscripts within 30  days and to provide a letter with detailed responses to each of the reviewers&rsquo;  comments. Failure to re-submit the article within 30 days will cause the paper  to be withdrawn from the submission system. Revised manuscripts are sent back  to reviewers for reassessment. At this time, a new decision is made, for either  the acceptance, rejection, or need for additional revisions. Based on the  reviewers&rsquo; comments, the editors make the final decision.</p></td>

      <p>  <b>Preparing the manuscript</b><br>
        <i>1. General principles</i><br>
        The text of  articles reporting original research should be divided into Introduction,  Methods, Results, and Discussion sections, but subheadings within these  sections may be needed to further organize their content. Other types of  articles, such as meta-analyses, may require different formats, while narrative reviews and&nbsp;editorials may have less structured or  unstructured formats. All pages should be numbered. Electronic formats have  created opportunities for adding details or sections, layering information,  cross-linking, or extracting portions of articles in electronic versions.  Supplementary electronic-only material should be submitted and sent for peer  review simultaneously with the primary manuscript.</p>
      <p><i>2. Authorship and Acknowledgments </i><br>
        The ICMJE  recommends that authorship be based on the following four criteria:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Substantial contributions to the  conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or  interpretation of data for the work; AND</li>
        <li>Drafting the work or revising it  critically for important intellectual content; AND</li>
        <li>Final approval of the version to be  published; AND</li>
        <li>Agreement to be accountable for all  aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or  integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition  to being accountable for the parts of the work he or she has done, an author  should be able to identify which co-authors are responsible for specific other  parts of the work. In addition, authors should have confidence in the integrity  of the contributions of their co-authors. The corresponding author takes  primary responsibility for communication with the journal during the manuscript  submission, peer review, and publication process.<br>
        All those  designated as authors should meet all four criteria for authorship, and all who  meet the four criteria should be identified as authors. It is the collective  responsibility of the authors to determine that all people named as authors  meet all four criteria. Those who do not meet all four criteria should be  acknowledged. <br>
        The  Acknowledgments section should disclose any sources of financial support  received by the study. In addition, this section should acknowledge people,  groups or institutions which have made important contributions to the study but  do not meet the criteria for authorship (e.g., technical assistance,  statistical analysis, writing, etc.).</p>
      <p><i>3. Reporting guidelines</i><br>
        Reporting  guidelines have been developed for different study designs; examples include <a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/">CONSORT</a> for randomized trials, <a href="http://strobe-statement.org/">STROBE</a> for observational studies, <a href="http://prisma-statement.org/">PRISMA</a> for systematic reviews and  meta-analyses, and <a href="http://www.stard-statement.org/www.stard-statement.org/">STARD</a> for  studies of diagnostic accuracy. Authors are encouraged to follow these  guidelines. Moreover, authors of review manuscripts are encouraged to describe  the methods used for locating, selecting, extracting, and synthesizing data;  this is mandatory for systematic reviews. <br>
  <b>Randomized clinical trials. </b>Trends in Psychiatry and  Psychotherapy will only accept for publication clinical trials that have been  registered in Clinical Trials Registries. The registration number will be  disclosed at the end of the abstract. In the text, whenever a registration  number is available, authors should list that number the first time they use a  trial acronym to refer to the trial they are reporting or to other trials that  they mention in the manuscript.</p>
      <p><i>4. Manuscript sections</i><br>
        The  following are general requirements for reporting within sections of all study  designs and manuscript formats.</p>
      <p>Title Page<br>
        General  information about an article and its authors is presented on a manuscript title  page. This page should include the article title, author information, any  disclaimers, sources of support, word count, and the number of tables and  figures. Detailed instructions are provided below.</p>
      
        <p> 1) Article  title. The title should provide a distilled description of the complete article  and should include information that, along with the Abstract, will make  electronic retrieval of the article sensitive and specific. Whenever deemed  appropriate, information about the study design should be a part of the title  (particularly important for randomized trials and systematic reviews and  meta-analyses). </p>
        <p> 2)&nbsp;A  short title of no more than 50 characters should be provided. </p>
        <p> 3) Author  information should include full names typed exactly as they should appear in print,  emails, and main affiliation(s). The name of the department(s) and  institution(s) or organization(s) where the work should be attributed should be  specified. </p>
        <p> 4) The  corresponding author should be identified, and a full mailing address  (including ZIP code), telephone and fax numbers, and an email address should be  provided. </p>
        <p> 5) Source(s)  of support. These include grants, equipment, drugs, and/or other support that  facilitated conduct of the work described in the article or the writing of the  article itself. Any relevant role of the funder in the study should be  disclaimed. Studies that have received no financial support should indicate so.</p>
        <p> 6) Conflict  of interest declaration. Conflict of interest information for each author needs  to be part of the manuscript. A general statement should be included in the  title page, attesting to the existence (or non-existence) of any conflicts of  interest concerning the publication of the article. In addition, all authors are  required to fill and submit an <a href="http://www.icmje.org/conflicts-of-interest/" target="_blank">ICMJE conflict of interest disclosure form</a><a href="http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/manuscript-preparation/coi_disclosure.pdf"></a> (one for each author) at the time of  submission. </p>
        <p> 7) Articles  based on academic theses or dissertations, or previously presented at  scientific meetings, should disclose this on the title page. Please provide as  many details as possible (e.g., the title of the original work, year, name of institution/venue/event, etc.).</p>
        <p> 8) A  word count for the paper's text, excluding the abstract, acknowledgments,  tables, figure legends, and references, should be provided.</p>
        <p> 9) The  date of the last literature review performed by the authors on the manuscript  topic should be informed.</p>
      
        <p>Abstract<br>
        Abstracts  should be no longer than 250 words. The abstract should provide the context or  background for the study and should state the study's purpose, basic procedures  (selection of study participants, settings, measurements, analytical methods),  main findings (giving specific effect sizes and their statistical and clinical  significance, if possible), and principal conclusions. It should emphasize new  and important aspects of the study or observations, note important limitations,  and not overinterpret findings. Because abstracts are the only substantive  portion of the article indexed in many electronic databases, and the only  portion many readers read, authors need to ensure that they accurately reflect  the content of the article. For clinical trials, the clinical trial  registration number will be disclosed at the end of the abstract. </p>
      <p>Keywords<br>
        Following  the abstract, three to six keywords should be provided in accordance with the  Medical Subject Headings (MeSH, <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html" target="_blank">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html</a>). If  possible, a Brazilian Portuguese translation of the abstract (resumo) and  keywords (palavras-chave) should also be provided; in this case, the  palavras-chave should be compliant with the DeCS database (DeCS &ndash; Descritores  em Ci&ecirc;ncias da Sa&uacute;de, <a href="http://decs.bvs.br/" target="_blank">http://decs.bvs.br/</a>).</p>
      <p>Statistical  analysis<br>
        Describe  statistical methods with enough detail to enable a knowledgeable reader with  access to the original data to judge its appropriateness for the study and to  verify the reported results. When possible, quantify findings and present them  with appropriate indicators of measurement error or uncertainty (such as  confidence intervals). Avoid relying solely on statistical hypothesis testing,  such as p values, which fail to convey important information about effect size  and precision of estimates. References for the design of the study and  statistical methods should be to standard works when possible (with pages  stated). Define statistical terms, abbreviations, and symbols. Specify the  statistical software package and version used. Distinguish prespecified from  exploratory analyses, including subgroup analyses.</p>
      <p>For additional  guidance on how to prepare each section of the main text, please refer to the <a href="http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/manuscript-preparation/preparing-for-submission.html">Recommendations</a>. </p>
      <p>References<br>
        Authors  should provide direct references to original research sources whenever  possible. Although references to review articles can be an efficient way to  guide readers to a body of literature, review articles do not always reflect  original work accurately. On the other hand, extensive lists of references to  original work on a topic can use excessive space. Do not use conference  abstracts as references; they can be cited in the text, in parentheses.  References to papers accepted but not yet published should be designated as &ldquo;in  press.&rdquo; Information from manuscripts submitted but not accepted should be cited  in the text as &ldquo;unpublished observations&rdquo; with written permission from the  source. Avoid citing a &ldquo;personal communication&rdquo; unless it provides essential  information not available from a public source, in which case the name of the  person and date of communication should be cited in parentheses in the text. The  accuracy of references is the responsibility of the authors.</p>
      <p> References  should be numbered consecutively in the order in which they are first mentioned  in the text. Identify references in text, tables, and legends by superscript Arabic  numerals. References cited only in tables or figure legends should be numbered  in accordance with the sequence established by the first identification in the  text of the particular table or figure. </p>
      <p> References  should be listed at the end of the article according to their order of citation  in the text and should comply with the style set forth in the <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html" target="_blank">NLM's International  Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) Recommendations for the Conduct,  Reporting, Editing and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals:  Sample References</a> webpage. The titles of journals should be abbreviated according  to the style used for MEDLINE (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/journals). These  resources are regularly updated as new media develop, and currently include  guidance for print documents; unpublished material; audio and visual media;  material on CD-ROM, DVD, or disk; and material on the Internet. Please consult  published issues for style details. An EndNote style can also be downloaded from  the Instructions &amp; Forms section at our submission web site (<a href="http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/trends-scielo" target="_blank">http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/trends-scielo</a>).<br>
        Journal  article example: Halpern SD, Ubel PA, Caplan AL. Solid-organ transplantation in  HIV-infected patients. N Engl J Med. 2002;347:284-7. </p>
      <p>Tables<br>
        Tables should complement, not duplicate information contained in the text. They should not exceed 30,000 characters (including spaces); larger tables may be considered if the authors justify their need. Tables  should not be submitted as images, but should be created using specific word  processor tools. Do not underline or draw lines inside the tables. Do not  insert spaces to separate columns. Number tables consecutively in the order of  their first citation in the text using Arabic numerals and supply a title for  each. </p>
      <p> Titles in  tables should be short but self-explanatory, containing information that allows  readers to understand the table's content without having to go back to the  text. Be sure that each table is cited in the text. Give each column a short or  an abbreviated heading. Authors should place explanatory matter in footnotes,  not in the heading. Explain all nonstandard abbreviations in footnotes, and use  symbols to explain information if needed (*, &dagger;, &Dagger;, &sect;, ||, &para;, **, &dagger;&dagger;, etc.).  Identify statistical measures of variations, such as standard deviation and  standard error of the mean.<br>
        If you use  data from another published or unpublished source, obtain permission and acknowledge  that source fully.</p>
      <p> Additional  tables containing backup data too extensive to publish in print may be  appropriate for publication in the electronic version of the journal, as  supplementary online material, or made available to readers directly by the  authors. An appropriate statement should be added to the text to inform readers  that this additional information is available and where it is located. Submit  such tables for consideration with the paper so that they will be available to  the peer reviewers.</p>
      <p>Figures<br>
        Digital  images of manuscript illustrations (all referred to as &ldquo;Figure&rdquo;) should be  submitted in a suitable format for print publication (preferably .tif, with a  minimum resolution of 300 dpi). Letters, numbers, and symbols on figures should  be clear and consistent throughout, and large enough to remain legible when the  figure is reduced for publication. Figures should be made as self-explanatory  as possible. Titles and detailed explanations belong in the legends, not on the  illustrations themselves.</p>
      <p> Figures  should be numbered consecutively according to the order in which they have been  cited in the text. If a figure has been published previously, acknowledge the  original source and submit written permission from the copyright holder to  reproduce it. Permission is required irrespective of authorship or publisher  except for documents in the public domain. Photographs should not allow patient  identification.<br>
        In the  manuscript, legends for illustrations should be on a separate page, with Arabic  numerals corresponding to the illustrations. When symbols, arrows, numbers, or  letters are used to identify parts of the illustrations, identify and explain  each one clearly in the legend.</p>
      <p><i>5. Units of Measurement</i><br>
        Measurements  of length, height, weight, and volume should be reported in metric units  (meter, kilogram, or liter) or their decimal multiples. Temperatures should be  in degrees Celsius. Blood pressures should be in millimeters of mercury.</p>
      <p><i>6. Abbreviations and symbols</i><br>
        Use only  standard abbreviations; use of nonstandard abbreviations can be confusing to  readers. Avoid abbreviations in the title of the manuscript. The spelled-out  abbreviation followed by the abbreviation in parenthesis should be used on  first mention unless the abbreviation is a standard unit of measurement.</p>
      <p><i>7. Drugs</i><br>
        Drugs  should be referred to by their generic name only.</p></td>

A cover letter including  the following information is also recommended.
      <ul>
        <li><i>A full statement to the editor about  all submissions and previous reports that might be regarded as redundant  publication of the same or very similar work.</i> Any such work should be referred to  specifically and referenced in the new paper. Copies of such material should be  included with the submitted paper to help the editor address the situation. </li>

        <li><i>Contact information</i> for the corresponding author, if  that information is not included in the manuscript itself.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The letter  or form should give any additional information that may be helpful to the  editor, such as the type or format of article that the manuscript represents.  If the manuscript has been submitted previously to another journal, it is  helpful to include the previous editor&rsquo;s and reviewers&rsquo; comments with the  submitted manuscript, along with the authors&rsquo; responses to those comments.  Editors encourage authors to submit these previous communications. Doing so may  expedite the review process and encourages transparency and sharing of  expertise.</p>
      <p> The  manuscript must also be accompanied by permission to reproduce previously  published material, use previously published illustrations, report information  about identifiable persons, or to acknowledge people for their contributions.</p>
