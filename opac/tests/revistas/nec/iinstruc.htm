      <p>Novos  Estudos, a  multidisciplinary quarterly journal (using a blind peer evaluation system),  has been published for over 30 years by Cebrap (Brazilian Centre of Analysis  and Planning). It publishes articles written by Brazilian and foreign authors.<br>
        <br>
The journal  aims to present in-depth analysis about humanities, and contributes to the  discussion of ideas in a broad range of subjects.</p></td>

      <p>Publication and evaluation criteria<br>
        <br>
The publication of the articles responds  exclusively to criteria of merit. The merit evaluation process is the same for  all articles - including those those commissioned by the Editorial Board. After  submission, the articles go through to a desk review regarding their adequacy  to the journal's editorial objective and policy. Within 30 days, counting from  the day of submission, the authors will receive news about the result of this  first stage.<br>
   <br>
      The journal operates under the principle of  double anonymity: articles approved in the first stage will be submitted to two <em>ad hoc</em> referees and, in case of  contradictory opinions, a third evaluation will be required.  The  evaluation of articles will consider quality and accuracy of arguments, data validity,  timeliness and relevance for the research area, current relevance and adequacy  of references.<br>
      <br>Conflict of interest situations of any nature  (personal, commercial, political, academic or financial) may occur among  editors, reviewers or authors. These situations will be dealt with by involving  unbiased external members in the evaluation process.<br>
      <br>
        There are four possible outcomes for the second  step: &quot;approved for publication without modification,&quot; &quot;approved  for publication subject to modifications,&quot; &quot;revise and resubmit&quot;  and &quot;refused.&quot; The third result implies that the Journal does not  assume publication commitment if there is resubmission. The Journal will not  accept resubmissions if the two reviewers indicate &quot;review and  resubmit&quot; or if one of the reviewers rejects the article and the editorial  committee agrees to that opinion.<br>
  <br>
      The journal shall forward, within an estimated  period of approximately (6) six months, a letter of decision on the article  received, sharing the evaluations whenever appropriate.<br>
    <br>
        Articles with a favorable opinion and another  of &quot;review and resubmit&quot; should be sent within three months after  receipt of the review. Once this deadline has expired, the articles will be  removed from the Editorial Board schedule. Articles with an opinion favorable  to publication through modifications should be reviewed and resubmitted in up  to thirty days. The Editorial Committee reserves the right to suggest new  changes in content or form, in order to adapt the article to the editorial or  graphic profile of the Journal.<br>
  <br>
      The Journal does not accept translations of  articles that have been published.<br>
   <br>
        Reciprocity<br>
  <br>
        The submission of articles under the double  blind peer review system implies the commitment of the author to respond as  satisfactorily as possible to the observations of the reviewers. The Journal  appreciates the effort of the academic community to contribute to improving the  quality of the scientific production of the social sciences in Brazil. Therefore,  it will not submit manuscripts that have received a negative opinion in another  journal without the authors having responded to the reservations raised by the evaluations.  For the same reason, the Journal reserves the right to refuse articles whose  reformulation disregards the suggestions of the reviewers without reasonable  justification.<br>
  <br>
        Authors who submit articles to the Journal are  committed to issuing reviews. The Editorial Committee reserves the right not to  submit to the second evaluation stage (double blind peer review) articles whose  authors have repeatedly declined to issue reviews when invited by the Journal.<br>
  <br>
      Good scientific practices<br>
    <br>
      The journal follows the guidelines of the Codes  of Ethics of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)  (http://www.publicationethics.org/) of the Brazilian National Council for  Scientific and Technological Development (http: // www.cnpq.br/web / guest /  guidelines) and the Foundation for Research Support of the State of São Paulo  (http://www.fapesp.br/boaspraticas/).<br>
   <br>
        Form and preparation of manuscripts<br>
        We accept the following types of contributions  in Portuguese and English: <br>
      Unpublished articles<br>
   <br>
        The text should be prepared  in the same file in the following sequence: article of up to 50 thousand  characters with spaces (including bibliographical references and notes);  biographical note (up to 40 words) including education, institution, position,  areas of interest, main publications and e-mail; footnotes in Arabic numerals;  bibliographic references; title of the article, abstract (between 350 and 450  characters with spaces) in Portuguese and English, followed by up to five  keywords in Portuguese and English; and, where appropriate, the credits of the  images used.<br>
  <br>
        Drawings, photographs,  graphs, maps, sketches and tables must contain title and source, and be  numbered. They should also be in the right conditions for reliable and quality  B &amp; W reproduction and printing. In addition to being included in the body  of the article, the images should be sent in a separate file of the text in  .tiff (preferably) or .jpg format and in high resolution (300 dpi), measuring  at least 17 cm (3,000 pixels) on its wider side. It is the author’s  responsibility to obtain authorization for reproduction.<br>
  <br>
      Texts should be written in  Times New Roman font size 12, standard paragraph start indentation, justified  alignment, double spacing, and A 4 size (210 × 297 cm) pages on a single side.<br>
   <br>
        The notes should come to  the end of the text, and cannot consist of simple bibliographical references.  These should appear in the body of the text in the following format: (surname  of the author, year of publication), as the example: (Tilly, 1996).<br>
        <br>
        In case of citations, when  the transcription exceeds five lines, it should be centered in narrower margins  than the ones of the body of the article; when less than five lines, it must be  in the body of the text and with quotation marks. In both cases the reference  will follow the format: (surname of the author, year of publication: pages),  according to the examples: (Tilly, 1996: 105) (Tilly, 1996: 105). </p>
<p>Complete  bibliographical references in alphabetical order  should appear after the endnotes and adhere to the following style format  (other complementary elements are optional):</p>
