    <p>All manuscripts should be &nbsp;submitted as .doc or .docx files. The  sequence of contents  should be: Title, full names of Author(s), Address(es) and E-mail(s), Running  Head, Abstract, Key Words, Text (Introduction, Material and Methods, Results  and Discussion), Acknowledgements, References, Captions for Tables and Figures.</p>
    <p><strong>Figures and Tables: Figures and Tables should be submitted as separate files</strong>(TIF, JPG, or CDR), using the  appropriate forms in  the ScholarOne system. Figure  captions<strong> should be self-explanatory.</strong></p>
    <p>Figures and tables will be printed directly from the electronic files sent by authors and should therefore be of high quality. For black and white draw/line artwork, these should be 600 dpi resolution at final size. Half-tone grayscale artwork should be 600 dpi at final size. Color half-tone images should be submitted as 300 dpi. All figures should be labeled with a medium weight sans serif font of an appropriate size to result in 8 point (3.33 mm) type when reduced to single column width. Special attention with the scale bar thickness is necessary.</p>
    <p><strong>Tables: Tables should be self-explanatory  submitted as separate files </strong>(.doc or .docx)<strong> </strong>using the appropriate forms in the ScholarOne  system. Vertical lines and Roman numerals in the tables should be avoided.</p>
    <p><strong>Text Formatting:</strong> Please use Times New Roman, size 12, and double-space formatting. Use hyphen between  connecting words (e.g., spring-tide, fine-mesh) and en-dash between ranges  (e.g., C-F, 33-39) and opposite words (e.g., size-frequency distribution,  male-female pair). We recommend checking an article  published recently in  Nauplius as a guideline. </p>
    <p><strong>Running  head:</strong> Please supply a running head of no more than 52 characters.
</p>
    <p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The abstract should be in English and should  not exceed <strong>250 words</strong>. </p>
    <p><strong>Key words:</strong> provide up to five indexing terms not used in the title.</p>
    <p><strong>Taxonomic papers</strong></p>
    <p>Requirements of taxonomic and nomenclatural procedures need reasonable consistency in the organization of such papers. Telegraphic style is mandatory for descriptions and diagnoses. Study of articles in recent numbers should be helpful in determining style and format. The establishment of new taxa must conform to the requirements of the latest edition of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. The publication of new taxa in electronic journals is currently allowed by the Code (<a href="http://iczn.org/content/electronic-publication-made-available-amendment-code" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=pt-BR&q=http://iczn.org/content/electronic-publication-made-available-amendment-code&source=gmail&ust=1476783721809000&usg=AFQjCNEYYMParmFhrIMUQJFsg2q4RaJwrQ">http://iczn.org/content/electronic-publication-made-available-amendment-code</a>) and the new names proposed in such journals must be registered in the <em>Official Register of Zoological Nomenclature,</em> with ZooBank as its online version (<a href="http://zoobank.org/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=pt-BR&q=http://zoobank.org&source=gmail&ust=1476783721809000&usg=AFQjCNGVwTHTFU7U1uJU_pgtklOjbs5IbA">zoobank.org</a>). The Nauplius editorial team offers to the authors free registration of all publications and new taxa in Zoobank. Description of new species-group taxa must cite a type-specimen deposited in an institutional collection. Genus and species name of any animal must be in italics and followed by author and date of publication when first mentioned in the main text. Authors of species name of any other kingdom need not to be given. Publications containing the original description of any animal taxa may be cited in the references list. When mentioning a species for the first time its name must be given in full. After that, the contraction (e.g., <em>A. spinimanus</em> for<em>Achelous spinimanus</em>) should be used. Genbank accession numbers must be included for DNA results such that the raw data can be accessed and compared against the presented data.</p>
    <p><strong>References:</strong> All papers referred to in the text should be listed  alphabetically by the authors&rsquo; surname under the heading  &quot;References&quot;. Use &quot;in press&quot; only when formal acceptance  has been granted. Thesis, dissertations, abstracts presented at meetings <strong>must not be cited</strong>. Authors of quoted unpublished material  (e.g., manuscripts under review, internal reports, and certain conference  abstracts) should be cited only if strictly necessary. Author of quoted  unpublished material should be inserted in the text and designated as  &quot;unpublished data; unpubl. data&quot; or &quot;personal communication;  pers. comm.&quot; but should be omitted from the references list. In the body  of the text use: Silva (2006), (Silva, 2006), (Silva and Santos, 2006), (Silva,  2005; 2006; Santos, 2006), (Tab. 1; Tabs. 1, 2), and (Fig. 1; Figs. 1A, B). Do  not use &quot;op. cit.&quot; and avoid using &quot;apud&quot;. Name of  periodicals should be given in full and italic. Only the volume of papers published in scientific  journals must be provided. Use en-dash (-) for page ranges. For further details  please follow the examples below (or check a recently published article), as a guideline:</p>

    <p><strong>Short Communications:</strong> Short notes are accepted when they present information which cannot be incorporated into a regular paper. These contributions will be subjected to the full editorial process. Manuscripts should be prepared following the same recommendations of regular articles. The text should be limited to eight pages printed in times new roman, size 12, with double-space formatting, since they will not normally exceed four final pages in length and will contain only one figure or table. The sequence should be: Title, Full Names of Author(s), Address(es) and email(s), Running Head, Key Words, Text, Acknowledgements, and References. When necessary, captions for Tables and Figures, Tables, Figures (each one numbered and identified), must be included at the end of the manuscript.</p></td>
