    <td WIDTH="70%"><p>All submitted articles within the goals of the journal will be considered for publication, provided they have not been published or accepted for publication in any other journal. All articles will be peer reviewed under the responsibility of the editors, through a detailed analysis of the text.</p>
      <p>The files of the articles may be submitted in .tex and .doc format type, but not in .pdf format (the submission system generates a .pdf file). Doc files must have their equations entered
      using the Word equations tool. Tex files must comply with the following recommendations: to be in UTF-8 with accents; class statements, styles and other controls must be given in the preamble of the files; the TikZ package should not be used; the final text should be clean, and without comments; references should be given in the \ bibitem format.</p>
      <p>Authors are required to register at the electronic submission system, and provide all the requested information. The  submitting author must provide an ORCID ID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID,  <a href="http://orcid.org/">http://orcid.org/</a>) at the time of submission  by entering it in the user profile in the submission system. We strongly  encourage coauthors to do the same. Within the user area, besides submitting their articles, authors will be able to follow the editorial process from submission to the eventual publication. Although there is a corresponding author, all other authors share responsibility for the content of submitted manuscripts.</p>
      <p>Articles may be accepted in Portuguese, Spanish and English. Authors should indicate the most appropriate section for their articles. Besides the title, abstract and keywords in the language of the article, authors are required to give versions of these items in either Portuguese or English, as it is appropriate. In other words, titles, abstracts and keywords should be bilingual. Full details of the references should be given at the end of the article, according to the order of appearance in the text. References should contain the clear names of the authors (include <em>et al.</em> only after the tenth author), the full name of the journal, volume number (in bold), page number and year of publication (in parentheses). References to published books must contain the title in italics, the publisher, the city of the publisher and year of publication. Examples: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Journal: J.A. Silva, Phys. Rev. B <strong>26</strong>, 1 (1982). </li>
        <li>Book: J.A. Silva, <em>Book's name</em> (Publisher name, City, Year),  v. 2, p. 20. </li>
        <li>Book chapter: J.A. Silva,  in <em>Book's name</em>, edited by C. Brown (Publisher  name, City, Year). </li>
        <li>Proceedings: J.A. Silva, in <em>Anais do XXXIV Simpósio Nacional de  Ensino de Física</em>, City, Year, edited by C. Brown (Publisher name, City, Year),  p. 201. </li>
        <li>Thesis: J.A. Silva, <em>Thesis name</em>. Doctoral thesis, University, Year.</li>
        <li>Preprint: P.J. Miranda, M.S. Baptista and S.E.S. Pinto, arXiv:1306.2537  (2013).</ul>

      <p>The equations should be  provided in the text of the manuscript and should be referred as &quot;equation (1)&quot;.</p>
      <p>If there is any doubt, authors should look at articles published in the most recent issues of Rev. Bras. Ens. Fis. The proofs of accepted articles will be sent to authors for verification.</p>
      <p>All submitted articles are subjected to an initial check and a peer review process. Submissions that do not comply with the standards of the journal, or that contain illustrations and text difficult to read or reproduce, will be returned to the authors for the necessary corrections before the evaluation process. The accepted articles will be published editorially by SciELO, in a continuing, on-line basis, under a &quot;Creative Commons&quot; license.</p>
      <p>There is no kind of submission or publication fees  for the articles.</p>
    <p>The <strong>Rev. Bras. Ens. Fis.</strong> is divided into various specific sections. The section of &quot;General Articles&quot; will be devoted to theoretical, experimental, and computational physics articles, addressing physical topics and problems from a pedagogical point of view. Authors are suggested to consider less discussed topics in classical texts and research subjects that should be presented at an accessible level for non-specialists. The section on &quot;Products and Teaching Materials for Physical Education&quot; should give visibility to development work in physics teaching, with references to educational innovation or closely related work to the development of teaching materials. The section of &quot;Research in Physics Education&quot; is intended to disseminate research work in physics education, involving reasoning issues and novel educational research methodology relevant to the teaching of physics. The section of &quot;History of Physics and Related Sciences&quot; is broadly open to researchers in this field in Brazil, with emphasis on results that have implications in physics education. The journal also accepts short notes and book reviews.</p></td>
