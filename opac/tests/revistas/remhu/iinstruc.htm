  <p>The journal REMHU publishes national and international contributions (Portuguese, English, Spanish, Italian, and French) with the objective of making available interdisciplinary studies and in depth analysis about themes related to contemporary human mobility at an international level, such as, migrations, refugees, human trafficking, displaced persons, migration policies and legislation, assistance and monitoring of people in mobility, pastoral care, theology of migration, among others.</p>
  <p>The journal includes academic articles resulting from original field or theoretical researches, research reports, social and pastoral reflections, interviews, book reviews, and summaries of thesis and dissertations on human mobility and similar themes.</p>
  <p>Manuscripts are selected for publication based on: originality, theme relevance, quality of the scientific method used, and adequacy to the editorial guidelines of the journal.</p>
  <p>All the manuscripts submitted to the journal are evaluated by the editor in chief and revised by two or more referees who are experts on the theme and do not have access to the authors name, which guarantees the anonymity of the entire revision process. The accepted manuscripts are then sent back to the authors for approval and for the inclusion of the necessary corrections. The authors should resend the paper with the necessary corrections and justify, in an attached letter, why, if be the case, they do not agree with the suggested corrections. At the end of the process, the editorial board will decide whether or not to publish the manuscript.</p>
<p>The manuscripts subjected to REMHU cannot have been previously published or be simultaneously submitted to another periodical.</p>
<p>The target public of REMHU is the national and international academic community, as well as migration policy thinkers and makers, social service workers, and those involved in pastoral care of human mobility.</p>
<p>Articles accepted for publication become property of the journal.</p>
<p>The Journal adopts Plagium systems, Plagiarism Checker and / or CopySpider to identify plagiarism.</p></td>
