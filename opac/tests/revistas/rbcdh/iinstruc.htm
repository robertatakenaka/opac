      <p><b>The Aims and Scopes</b></p>
      <p>The <b>Revista Brasileira de Cineantropometria e Desempenho Humano</b> 
        is a journal dedicated to Physical Education, Sport and related areas. 
        The focus of the journal is on human movement, submissions are reviewed 
        by an international panel of peer reviewers and emphasis is on measurement 
        of people in their morphological and functional dimensions and investigation 
        of the factors that determine physical performance. The journal's multidisciplinary 
        character means that these areas of study are explored in a variety of 
        contexts and described in interaction with social, behavioral, health-related 
        and environmental factors.<br>
        The journal publishes Original Articles and relevant Review and Point 
        of View articles written in English, Spanish or Portuguese.</p>
      <p><b><br>
        Evaluation of Articles/</b>Peer Review Process<br>
        To be published, a manuscript has to be approved in all three steps:</p>
      <p><br>
        <b>Preliminary Analysis</b><br>
        Manuscripts will only be forwarded to reviewers after approval following 
        a preliminary analysis of compatibility with the scope and editorial policy 
        of RBCDH, article format and their potential for publication.</p>
      <p><b>Peer review</b><br>
        The RBCDH criteria for the acceptance of articles include: originality, 
        data validity, effective communication, repercussions of the conclusions, 
        and the scientific contribution made to Physical Education, Sports and 
        related areas. Each manuscript will be evaluated by two Reviewers, and 
        anonymity is guaranteed during the evaluation process.<br>
        The Reviewers will make specific and general comments about the scientific 
        merit of the study and will decide whether the article should be accepted, 
        rejected or accepted with corrections (the last decision does not guarantee 
        publication). Corrected articles will go through a new evaluation process.<br>
        The Reviewers will send their opinions to the Scientific Editor, who will 
        forward the reply to the authors via electronic mail. Provided with the 
        Reviewers' comments, the Editor will make the final decision. In the case 
        of discrepancies between the opinions of the first two Reviewers, the 
        opinion of a third Reviewer might be requested.</p>
      <p>Writing/Style: technical writing and compliance to the Journal's style 
        complete the review process.</p>
      <p>The Journal adopts iThenticate system for identifying plagiarism.</p>
      <p>Articles accepted for publication become property of the journal.</p></td>
