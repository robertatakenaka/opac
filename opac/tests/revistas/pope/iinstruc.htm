      <p>The  aim of <b>Pesquisa Operacional</b> is to publish papers produced by the  Operations Research (OR) scientific community in order to promote its integration  and to disseminate the scientific knowledge generated within it. </p>
      <p><b>Pesquisa Operacional</b> publishes theoretical and applied papers of any OR  sub-areas, as well as surveys on topics of interest and papers on the history  or methodology of OR. Submitted papers must be written in English, must be  original, and must not have been accepted for publication (or published) by a  refereed journal, nor be in the process of evaluation for publication by any  other periodical. In addition to originality and relevance, it will be taken  into account the quality of presentation (clarity, style and organization of  the text) and the adequacy of the text to the interests of the readers of the  journal. Submitted papers will be evaluated by at least two referees using a   blind review system and the final decision will be communicated to the  corresponding author by the Editor-in-Chief. </p>
   
      <p>        <b>Pesquisa  Operacional</b> publishes papers in English. When submitting a  manuscript the author(s) will be implicitly giving their rights to the Brazilian  Operations Research Society (SOBRAPO) and saying that third parties rights are  not being violated.</p>

In case  there are references in the text, they should be made to sections and not to  page numbers. Size and option for characters are as follows: article title: 12  uppercase bold, author(s): 12 bold uppercase / lowercase, origin: 11 normal  uppercase lowercase, abstract and keyword titles: 11 bold uppercase /  lowercase, keywords: 11 normal, abstract texts: 10normal, article text: 11 bold  (titles); 11 normal (text).</p>
      <b>Pesquisa Operacional</b> provides for authors a LaTeX template to prepare 
      their articles, which is available for downloading at the link: <a href="http://www.sobrapo.org.br/revista/_po.php">http://www.sobrapo.org.br/documentos/template-PO.tex</a>
<p>In  the first page, only the paper title, name(s) and affiliation(s) of the  author(s), abstracts and keywords are contained. The title must be centered and  placed below the first third of the useful page height. This must be followed  by two single spaces and the name of each author (without titles or positions),  followed, in the next line, by the name of his (her) institution, all  left-justified but on the right half of the page. Onl at this page a footnote  containing data about authors is allowed, if this format is preferred. After  two single spaces follows the abstract. The abstract must contain no more than  150 words, which is the limit for publication in IFORS' IAOR. After the  abstract three keywords must be provided.</p>
        <p>The  paper must begin with an introduction. Footnotes are not permitted.  Acknowledgements must not exceed 5 lines and must be placed after the main  text, before the references.</p>
        <p>Graphical  objects should be incorporated into the text by the text editor. Objects made  with several elements should be grouped. Use of shadowing is not recommended.  Color printing is not supported.</p>
