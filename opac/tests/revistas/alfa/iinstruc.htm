   <p><strong>ALFA &#150;  Revista de Lingu&iacute;stica</strong> &#150;  the linguistics journal of the S&atilde;o Paulo State University (UNESP),  sponsored by the Research Provost, publishes papers authored by professors,  researchers, and PhD students in co-authorship with professors and researchers  from national and international institutions of learning, teaching and research.  Maximum number of co-authors should be 3. Regular issues are organized in a  &ldquo;continuous flow&rdquo; system, and special issues are edited according to the  organizers&rsquo; convenience. The journal publishes papers, book reviews, interviews  and translations with a substantial contribution to any of the various branches  of Linguistics. </p>
Contributions in the form  of articles should be original and unpublished and cannot be simultaneously  submitted for publication in other journal. Only reviews of books published in  Brazil in the last 2 years and abroad in the last 4 years should be submitted  for publication in the journal. Translations should be preferably of scientific  articles and book chapters published within twelve months of submission;  interviews should be conducted with researchers with academic prestige  acknowledged in Brazil and abroad.
   <p>
     All submissions are read by two anonymous referees. Authors&rsquo; identities  are not revealed to the referees. Should the judgments of the two referees be  inconsistent, a third referee should be called in. Once the refereeing process  is concluded, the review copies are sent to the author, or to the first author  of co-authored papers, with the appropriate instructions.</p>
   <p>Papers can be written  in one of the following languages: <strong>Portuguese,  English, French, Spanish</strong>, or <strong>Italian</strong>. In papers written in <strong>Portuguese</strong>, <em>T&Iacute;TULO, RESUMO</em>, and <em>PALAVRAS-CHAVE</em> should come  before the body of the paper, and their English versions, <em>TITLE, ABSTRACT</em>, and <em>KEY-WORDS</em>, after it. In  papers written in any of <strong>the  other languages</strong>, the corresponding elements that come before  the body of the paper should be written in the same language the paper was  written; the corresponding elements that come after the body of the paper  should be written in <strong>Portuguese</strong> for papers written in <strong>English</strong> and in <strong>English</strong> for papers written in <strong>French,  Spanish</strong>, or <strong>Italian</strong>.</p>
   <p>All articles  are published in a bilingual  format, with English necessarily as the second language  version. Authors who submit for approval an  article originally in English  must, in case it is  accepted, provide its version  in Portuguese, following  the same guidelines indicated for  the English language. Only articles with accepted versions in Portuguese (or  another chosen language) and English will be published. If both versions are not  accepted, the article will not be published. </p>
   <p>The journal editor  reserves the right to return a manuscript if it departs from the style  requirements. When applicable, a personal letter will be sent to the author,  asking for improvements and adaptations. </p>
   <p>Authors are  responsible for the data and concepts expressed in the paper as well as for the  correctness of the references and bibliography.</p></td>

<p><strong>3.2.</strong><strong> In-text references  and quotations</strong></p>
<p>For references in the text, the surname of the author should be in  CAPITALS, enclosed in parentheses; a comma should be placed between the  author&rsquo;s last name and year, e.g. (BARBOSA, 1980). If the name of the author is  part of the text, only the year is enclosed in parentheses: &ldquo;Morais (1955) argues...&rdquo; </p>
<p>
  Page numbers  follow the year and are preceded by &ldquo;p.&rdquo;; note a comma and a space between year  and &ldquo;p.&rdquo;, and between &ldquo;p.&rdquo; and the number, e.g. (MUNFORD, 1949, p. 513).</p>
<p>
  References of  the same author with the same year should be distinguished by using lower case  letters in alphabetical order, e.g. (PESIDE, 1927a), and (PESIDE, 1927b). For  references with one author and up to two co-authors, semi-colons are used to  separate the surnames, e.g. (OLIVEIRA; MATEUS; SILVA, 1943); for references  with more than two co-authors, the expression &ldquo;et al.&rdquo; substitutes for the  surnames of the co-authors, e.g. (GILLE et al., 1960).</p>
Quotations longer than three text lines should  be set in 11-point font size, and set out as a separate paragraph (or  paragraphs) on a new line. The paragraph (or paragraphs) should be 4.0 cm from  the left margin throughout, without any quotation marks. Quotations shorter  than three text lines should be included in double quotation marks in the  running text. Quotations from texts in foreign languages must be translated into Portuguese.  Published translations should be used whenever possible. The  original text should appear in a footnote.
<p><strong>3.3. Italics, bold, underlining and quotation marks</strong></p>
<p>Italics: Use italics for foreign words, book titles  int the body of the text, or for emphasis. </p>
<p><br>
  Bold: Use bold only in the title of the article and in  the text headings and subheadings. </p>
<p><br>
  Underlining:  Avoid using underlining.</p>
<p><br>
  Quotation marks: In the body of the text, quotation  marks should be used for quotations from texts, but never for titles, songs,  chapter or parts of books. Example:</p>
<p><br>
  A lingu&iacute;stica &eacute; uma disciplina que &ldquo;se baseia na  observa&ccedil;&atilde;o dos factos e se abst&eacute;m de propor qualquer escolha entre tais factos,  em nome de certos princ&iacute;pios est&eacute;ticos e morais&rdquo; (MARTINET, 1972, p.3).</p>
<p><strong>3.4.</strong><strong> Footnotes</strong> </p>

Indication of the source  and other information necessary for its understanding  should appear below the figure. Figures should be submitted as  separate files, saved in the program  in which they were generated. Maps, photographs and radiographs  should also be submitted as  separate files, high-resolution (300  dpi). Author(s)  are responsible for image copyrights. </p>
<p><strong>3.6.</strong><strong> Tables and text  frames</strong></p>
<p>Tables  should be used to present statistical information, and text frames should be  used to summarize and organize textual information. The title is  inserted above the table, centered, beginning with &ldquo;Table 1&rdquo; in  bold, followed by a hyphen  and the title without emphasis, in the same font  and size of the body text;  the title of illustrations and text frames should be presented above the figure, centered, beginning  with &ldquo;text frame 1&rdquo; in bold, followed  by a hyphen and the title without emphasis, in  the same font and size of the  body text. The numbering is consecutive, in Arabic numerals; if you need to specify the data source, it must be placed below the table or the table and the text  aligned to the left. Tables should be built with  the open side borders and no  lines separating columns. </p>
<p><strong>3.7.</strong><strong> Appendixes and  Annexes</strong></p>
<p>When  absolutely necessary to the text comprehension, and within the limit of 30  pages, Annexes and / or appendixes, following the subsection style, should be  included in the end of the paper, after the references or bibliography.</p>

<p><strong>3.9. Translation format</strong></p>
<p>Translated articles  are subjected to a peer review process, to decide  on the opportunity and the convenience  of their publication. They should  follow the article format, where applicable. In the second line below the name of the author of the translated text, right-aligned, the name(s)  of the translator(s) should  appear in the following format: &quot;Translated  by [name(s) of the translator(s)]&quot;, with an asterisk referring to a footnote with  the following information: full name  and acronym of  the institution to which the translator(s) belong; city; state; country; zip  code; email. The translated text must  be accompanied with a written  authorization of the publisher responsible  for the original publication. </p>
<p><strong>3.10. Interview format</strong></p>
<p>Interviews are  subjected to a peer review process,  which decides on the opportunity and the convenience of its  publication. The format of the  interview is the same required for  articles, but the title should  contain, besides the general theme,  the expression &quot;Interview  with [interviewee name]&quot;, without emphasis, with  an asterisk referring to a footnote containing a  brief review of the biography  of the interviewee, which clearly  demonstrates her/his scientific relevance. The author(s) of the  interview should follow, according  to the rules established for articles.</p>
<p><strong>3.11. English version</strong></p>
<p>The author(s) of paper accepted for  publication in Portuguese, French,  Spanish or Italian must provide the English version of the text until the deadline shown in the  e-mail notification of acceptance.  The standards for citation of authors in the text  and the references of the English version are the same as  the ones in Portuguese. <em>Alfa</em> appoints reviewers to  evaluate the English version of the article. The review is  restricted to checking the  quality of translation, i. e. adequation to the  standard norms of English usage for  research papers.</p>
<p>In case there are citations of works with an English-language edition,  this edition should  be used both in the text and  in the references. In case there is no English edition, the quoted text should be translated into  English, and the text in the original language of the edition used must be included in a footnote.</p>
<p>If the text contains figures scanned from advertisements  in newspapers, magazines or similar midia, in Portuguese or  another language, the English  version of the text must be included in a footnote.</p>
<p>When the text contains examples the understanding of which involves  the need to clarify morphosyntactic features, a literal version  of them in gloss should be included,  followed by the common English translation in  single quotation marks. Example:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/img/revistas/alfa/texto_port.jpg"></p>
<p>Conventions for the glosses: <strong><em>The Leipzig Glossing Rules:  conventions for interlinear  morpheme-by-morpheme glosses</em></strong>, edited by the Department of Linguistics of the Max Planck  Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology (Bernard Comrie,  Martin Haspelmath) and the Department of Linguistics at the  University of Leipzig (Balthasar Bickel); available  in <a href="http://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/resources/glossing-rules.php" target="_blank">http://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/resources/glossing-rules.php</a>. </p>
