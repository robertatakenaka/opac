      <p>All contributions sent to <strong>Lua  Nova</strong> will be submitted to the Editorial Board of the journal, which will  send them to two external reviewers for blind peer review.

It is  recommended, therefore, that the Conditions for Submitting Articles presented  herein are observed before submitting a manuscript to the journal.</p>
      <p> The publication of an article is the entire responsibility of the  author, thus not expressing the endorsement of the Editorial Board.</p>

      <p><strong>Ensuring Blind Peer  Review</strong><br>
        To ensure the integrity of blind peer review for submissions to the  journal, every care must be taken not to disclose the identity of authors and  reviewers during the process.

      <p><strong>1.</strong> The authors of the document must exclude from the text names, replacing  with &quot;Author&quot; and the year in references and footnotes, instead of  author names, article title, etc.</p>
      <p><strong>2.</strong> In Microsoft Office documents, the author ID must be removed from the  document properties (in the File&gt; Properties menu), starting with File, in  the main menu, and clicking on the sequence: File&gt; Save as ...&gt; Tools or  Options in Mac)&gt; Security Options ...&gt; Remove personal information from  the file by saving&gt; OK&gt; Save.</p>
      <p><strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
      <p>        The names and addresses informed for the editing of the manuscripts in  order to publishing will be used exclusively for this purpose and will not be  made available for other purposes or to third parties.</p>

      <p><strong>1)</strong> Lua Nova accept submission of articles in Portuguese, English and  Spanish. Quotations in foreign languages must be translated into the body of  the text. If the translation is by the author, please let this be clearly  stated, and, if necessary, insert the original in a footnote. When there is  highlighted text in citations it should also be made clear whether the  highlight is from the original author or from the author of the article.</p>
      <p>        <strong>2)</strong> All citations, even if short, must contain their source (author or  publication, year and page); We do not use idem, ibidem. See item # 11. Quotes  that occupy more than 3 lines in the text should be written in smaller size in  a separate paragraph.</p>
      <p>        <strong>3)</strong> All sources cited in the text must have complete bibliographic  information at the end of the article - NOT as footnotes, according to ABNT  Standards adapted to the journal standard. See examples in item # 13 or earlier  issues of <strong>Lua Nova</strong>.</p>
      <p>          <strong>4)</strong> If an electronic publication, link, quoted web page is no longer  accessible, keep the date it was accessed and insert a note about it; If in the  bibliography, put this information in brackets.</p>
      <p>        <strong>5)</strong> Footnotes only complement some information in the text, NEVER insert  bibliographical references of authors or works that are being mentioned, unless  it is a secondary citation.</p>
      <p>        <strong>6)</strong> All acronyms must be dismembered in their first occurrence in the text.  Do repeat its meaning, that is, the acronym in full throughout the text only if  absolutely necessary.</p>
      <p>        <strong>7)</strong> We do not use underlined or bold highlights. And italics are reserved  primarily for foreign words. Use it sparingly in other situations. Quotes are  for concepts, quotes, ironies, assumptions.</p>
      <p>        <strong>8)</strong> Foreign institutions are written in normal print, not in italics,  accompanied by their translation into Portuguese when they are not common  knowledge.</p>
      <p>        <strong>9)</strong> Avoid repetitions of words and language vices, such as  &quot;through,&quot; &quot;from,&quot; &quot;crucial,&quot; and so on.</p>
      <p>        <strong>10)</strong> Attend to the correct Spelling; Before submitting the article, use the  spelling checker from the Word program in the Review/ABC spelling and grammar  command. Pay particular attention to spelling and correct typing of foreign  words, especially names of authors or works.</p>
      <p>        <strong>11)</strong> Sources of citations or references to works made in the text follow the  author/date system - the author's name ONLY with the first letter capitalized.  Examples: &quot;[...] according to Romano (1996)&quot;; &quot;(Citation or text  that refers to the author/work)&quot; (Gurgel, 1997, p.17) or (Vieira and  Lopes, 1994), if two authors (note that &quot;e&quot; is not used) (Barbosa Ribeiro,  Gomes and Moreira Jr., 2011). If there are more than one work of the same  author and date, they are identified both in the text and in the bibliography  with the addition of lowercase letters in the date. Example:<br>
        (Said, 2007a) or (Said, 2007b, p.35). And in the bibliography:<br>
        SAID, E. W. 2007a. <em>Humanismo e cr&iacute;tica democr&aacute;tica</em>. S&atilde;o Paulo: Companhia das Letras.<br>
        _____. 2007b. <em>Orientalismo</em>.  S&atilde;o Paulo: Companhia das Letras.</p>
      <p><strong>12)</strong> The indication of the date of an original text or of the first edition  is not mandatory, it only becomes clear to the text or if it makes a  bibliographical survey. And in the bibliography, first &quot;common&quot;  issues are not noted.<br>
      Thus, he asserted, &quot;it is up to the legislator [i.e. To the  multitude] to correct governments or to change them completely, as well as to  establish them &quot;(Marsilius of Padua, 1956 [1324], 87). Marsilio, in fact,  transformed the act of naming into an act of foundation, thus introducing the  idea of &#8203;&#8203;sovereignty in terms of a productive multitude, &quot;a universal  active causality&quot; that &quot;shapes&quot; &quot;establishes&quot; and  &quot;differentiates&quot; the parts of the State (Marsilius of Padua, 1956  [1324], pp. 26, 63-64).</p>
