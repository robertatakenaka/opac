 <p>The journal &lsquo;Sa&uacute;de em Debate&rsquo; (Health in Debate), created in 1976, is published by Centro Brasileiro de Estudos de Sa&uacute;de (Cebes) (Brazilian Center for Health Studies), that aims to disseminate studies, researches and reflections that contribute to the debate in the collective health field, especially those related to issues regarding policy, planning, management and assessment in health. The editors encourage contributions from different theoretical and methodological perspectives and from various scientific disciplines.</p>
 <p> The journal is published on a quarterly basis; the Editors may decide on publishing special issues, which will follow the same submission and assessment process as the regular issues.</p>
 <p>&lsquo;Sa&uacute;de em Debate&rsquo; accepts unpublished and original works that bring relevant contribution to scientific knowledge in the health field.</p>
 <p> Authors are entirely and exclusively responsible for the submitted manuscripts, which must not be simultaneously submitted to another journal, be it integrally or partially. It is Cebes&rsquo; policy to own the copyright of all articles published in the journal.</p>
 <p>In case of approval and publication of the work in the journal, the copyrights referred to it will become property of the journal, which adopts the Creative Commons License CC-BY (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.pt">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.pt</a>) and the open access policy, so the texts are available for anyone to read, download, copy, print, share, reuse and distribute, with due citation of the source and authorship. In such cases, no permission is required from authors or publishers.</p>
<p> No fees are charged from the authors for the submission and evaluation of articles; nevertheless, once the article has been approved for publication, the authors are responsible for the language proofreading (obligatory) and the translation into English, based on a list of proofreaders and translators provided by the journal.</p>
<p>The journal has an Editorial Board that contributes to the definition of its editorial policy. Its members are part of the Editorial Committee and/or the database of referees in their specific areas.</p>
<p>Before being sent for peer review, articles submitted to the journal 'Saúde em Debate' undergo plagiarism-detecting softwares Plagiarisma and Copyspider. Thus, it is possible that the authors are questioned about information identified by the tool to guarantee the originality of the manuscripts, referencing all the sources of research used. Plagiarism is an unacceptable editorial behavior, so if its existence is proven, the authors involved will not be able to submit new articles to the journal.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Cebes editorial production is a result of collective work and of institutional and individual support. Authors' contribution for the continuity of 'Saúde em Debate' journal as a democratic space for the dissemination of critical knowledge in the health field shall be made by means of association to Cebes.

 <td width="70%"><p>Every manuscript received by &lsquo;Sa&uacute;de em Debate&rsquo; is submitted to prior analysis. Works that are not in accordance to the journal publishing norms shall be returned to the authors for adequacy and new submission. Once the journal&rsquo;s standards have been entirely met, manuscripts will be appraised by the Editorial Board, composed of the editor-in-chief and associate editors, for originality, scope, topicality, and compliance with the journal&rsquo;s editorial policy. Articles recommended by the Board shall be forwarded for assessment to at least two reviewers, who will be indicated according to the theme of the work and to their expertise, and who will provide their approval, refusal, and/or make recommendations to the authors.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Sa&uacute;de em Debate&rsquo; uses the double-blind review method, which means that the names of both the authors and the reviewers are concealed from one another during the entire assessment process. In case there is divergence between the reviewers, the article will be sent to a third reviewer. Likewise, the Editorial Board may also produce a third review. The reviewers&rsquo; responsibility is to recommend the acceptance, the refusal, or the reformulation of the works. In case there is a reformulation request, the authors shall return the revised work until the stipulated date. In case this does not happen, the work shall be excluded from the system.</p>
  <p>The editorial Board has full authority to decide on the final acceptance of the work, as well as on the changes made.</p>
  <p>No additions or changes will be accepted after the final approval of the work. In case the journal&rsquo;s Editorial Board has any suggestions regarding changes on the structure or contents of the work, these shall be previously agreed upon with the authors by means of e-mail communication.</p>
  <p>The typeset article proof will be sent by e-mail to the corresponding author; it must be carefully checked and returned until the stipulated date.</p>
  <p><strong>Complementary information (should be sent in a separate file)</strong></p>
  <p><strong>a) Conflict of interest.</strong> The works submitted for publication must comprise information on the existence of any type of conflict of interest. Financial conflict of interest, for example, is related not only to the direct research funding, but also to employment link. In case there is no conflict, it will suffice to place on the title page the statement "I declare that there has been no conflict of interest regarding the conception of this work".</p>
  <p><strong>b) Contributors.</strong> Individual contributions of each author should be specified at the end of the text. According to the authorship criteria developed by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), authorship should be based on the following conditions: a) substantial contribution to the conception and the design of the work, or to the analysis and interpretation of data for the work; b) substantial contribution to drafting the work or critically revising the contents; and c) participation at the final approval of the version to be published.</p>
