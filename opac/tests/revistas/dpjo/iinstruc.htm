      <p>One of the main purposes of Dental Press Journal is to preserve the idoneity 
        
        of the published articles, being valorized by the Dentistry class. Therefore, 
        
        all the articles received by Dental Press are submitted to the following 
        
        process:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>1) The manuscript is submitted via the online system ScholarOne Manuscripts: <u><a href="https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/dpjo-scielo" target="_blank">https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/dpjo-scielo</a></u>"<br>
          2) The editor selects 3 professionals, among all the consultants and co-workers of the journal, in order to evaluate the article. In order to evaluate the article. In this 
          
          phase the &quot;double blind&quot; system is used, i.e., the names of 
          
          the authors are omitted on purpose so that the analysis of the study 
          
          is not influenced, and the authors, although informed on the current 
          
          method, do not know who is responsible for evaluating their work.<br>
          3) Enclosed to the article, each consultant receives a questionnaire, 
          
          which will allow him to make observations and determine if the article 
          
          will be published or not. When sending the article and the filled questionnaire, 
          
          each consultant chooses if wants or not to revise the article once more. 
          
          Before the author&acute;s corrects the article, the editor will analyze 
          
          the corrections requested by the consultants.<br>
          4) The article will be selected for publishing only if both consultants 
          
          approve it. If one of them refuses it, the article will be sent to a 
          
          third consultant.<br>
          5) After the article has been approved by the consultants and the editor, 
          
          it will be submitted to the correction of the references according to 
          
          the Vancouver norms. <br>
          6) Professionals in charge of performing the desktop publishing make 
          
          the article suitable for the graphic criteria of the Journal.<br>
          7) Properly diagrammed and revised, the article is sent to the Scientific 
          
          Board of the Journal to be reviewed, observing the arrangement of the 
          
          pictures, plots, text, abstracts, keywords, and other components. <br>
          8) Finally, the article is sent to the author who will make the last 
          
          considerations. Only during this phase of the process, the authors are 
          
          informed on the edition in which his article will be published.<br>
          9) The articles and other materials of each edition are brought together, 
          
          forming the &quot;sketch&quot; of the issue that is revised page by 
          
          page, picture by picture, letter by letter by the magazine's art editor 
          
          who assumes the role of &quot;Ombudsman&quot;.<br>
          10) Only after performing the last corrections in the &quot;sketch&quot;, 
          
          the graphic and printing phases are properly initiated.<br>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
