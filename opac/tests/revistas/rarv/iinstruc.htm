      <p><b>Revista &Aacute;rvore</b> is a bimonthly journal of the Society of Forest 
        Investigations (SIF) that publishes high-quality original articles addressing 
        scientific research in the field of Forestry Science including Silviculture, 
        Forest Management, Technology and Use of Forest Products, Environment

      <p><b>Manuscript preparation</b></p>
      <p>&#149; <b>Revista &Aacute;rvore</b> is not responsible for the content and opinions 
        expressed in the published articles and these do not necessarily reflect 
        the opinions of the Society of Forest Investigation (SIF), being the author 
        entirely responsible for the scientific content in the paper. </p>
      <p>&#149; When submitting an article, the author (s) should agree that the 
        copyright of published manuscripts (if and when the paper is accepted) 
        will be held by the Society of Forest Investigation- SIF.</p>
      <p>The manuscript in English should be divided into sections, in the following 
        order: TITLE in English; ABSTRACT (followed by Keywords); MANUSCRIPT TITLE 
        in Portuguese; RESUMO (followed by Palavras-chave); 1. INTRODUCTION (including 
        literature review); 2.MATERIALS AND METHODS; 3.RESULTS; 4. DISCUSSION; 
        5.CONCLUSIONS; 
        6.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS (if necessary) and 7. REFERENCES.</p>
      <p>The subtitles, when necessary should be written with initial capital 
        letters, preceded by two Arabic numbers in a new paragraph. </p>
      <p>References in the text must be cited as follows: cited author's surname 
        with only the first capital letter, followed by the year in parentheses, 
        when the author is part of the text Author (2008). When the author is 
        not part of the text, the last name in parentheses in capital letters, 
        followed by the year and separated by a comma (AUTHOR, 2008). The cited 
        references should be preferentially from A/B Qualis level national or 
        international journals. <b>Revista &Aacute;rvore</b> follows ABNT 2002 - NBR 
        6023 standards, except for not using &quot;et al.&quot; in references with more than three authors. </p>
      <p>Do not use &quot;et al.&quot; in italics and the &quot;&amp;&quot; should 
        be replaced by &quot;and&quot; between authors. Original research papers 
        are conventionally structured: Introduction, Methods, Results and Discussion, 
        although other formats may be accepted. The Introduction should be brief, 
        with a definition of the studied problem, synthesizing its importance 
        and highlighting knowledge gaps (&quot;state of the art&quot;) that will 
        be addressed. Methods for the studied population, data source and selection 
        criteria, among others, should provide necessary and complete information 
        without prolixity. Results should contain a concise presentation of data 
        obtained without interpretations or comparisons. Tables or figures should 
        not repeat the information contained in the text, these must be separated 
        from the Discussion. Discussion should begin by appreciating the limitations 
        of the study (when appropriate), followed by an analysis of the obtained 
        results, taking current literature into consideration, without introduction 
        of new data. It should also contain the author's interpretation, drawing 
        conclusions and indicating the paths for further research.</p>
      <p>The abstract should be informative and summarize relevant points of the 
        study such as objectives, methodology, results and conclusions and should 
        be composed of a current sentence sequence with maximum of 250 words. 
        (ABNT-6028).</p>
