The manuscripts must not have been sent to any other  journal and will be selected for evaluation by the reviewers only if totally  within the norms of this Journal.</p>
      <p>Authors must have  their manuscripts reviewed by a specialist for orthography and grammar correction  of Portuguese and English before submitting or returning them to the Journal, at  any step of the process. Manuscripts with orthography problems will be negatively  affected in the evaluation and may be rejected for this reason. Manuscripts  addressing research with experiment will only be accepted for publication if at  least one of the following criteria is met: a) experiment with minimum of 20  plots; b) experimental design with number of residual degrees of freedom equal  to or higher than ten; and c) treatments must have at least three replicates.  Scientific manuscripts that describe research results obtained more than 8  years ago will not be accepted for publication. Authors must inform, in the items  Abstract, Resumo and Material and Methods, the period and place (including  geographical coordinates) of the research and, in the case of research with  experiment, the experimental design, treatments and the number of replicates.  Manuscripts subdivided into parts I, II and III etc. must be submitted  together, since they will be sent to the same reviewers.</p></td>

However,  from the Volume 20, Issue number 1 (January 2016) on, the Agriambi Journal will  be completely published in English. Manuscripts accepted for publication and  originally not submitted in English will be translated by a company selected by  the Journal and the costs will be paid by the authors, along with the payment  of the publication fee. For papers accepted for publication, already submitted  in English, the authors will be requested to arrange the correction of English  through one of the companies accredited by the Journal. The manuscripts must result  from researches in the areas of Soil, Water and Plant Management, Irrigation  and Drainage Engineering, Agricultural Meteorology and Climatology, Storage and  Processing of Agricultural Products, Environmental Control and Management (this  area includes only manuscripts describing researches on environmental control and  management in the agricultural context), Rural Construction and Ambience,  Automation and Instrumentation, Agricultural Machines and, finally, Energy in  Agriculture. Referring to the field of Rural Construction and Ambience, when  the approach is ambience it will be accepted for review only articles about  researches that deal with the effect of rural construction, that is, of the  building on the ambience of its facilities. The Journal accepts contributions  only in the modalities of Scientific Paper and Literature Review. Contributions  in the modalities of Preliminary Note and Technical Note are not accepted by  the Journal. In addition, it should be pointed out that the Journal does not  publish manuscripts of extension and/or purely technical nature; manuscripts  simply describing the development of software/electronic spreadsheets and  addressing Food Engineering will not be accepted for publication.</p></td>

  <tr>
    <td width="15%"></td>
    <td width="70%"><p>a) Word of Microsoft Office 2010: The manuscript must  be edited only in this version of Microsoft Word.</p>
      <p> b) Text: font Times New Roman, size 12. The text must  not contain bold or italic words, except for the title, items and sub-items,  which must be in boldface, and the scientific names of plant and animal  species, which must be in italic. Equations, tables and figures must not  contain italic or bold words. The equations should be written using the software  MS Equation. Long paragraphs should be avoided and, preferentially, paragraphs  must have a maximum of 60 words.</p>
      <p> c) Spacing: the text must be double-spaced in the  entire manuscript.</p>
      <p> d) Paragraph: 0.5 cm.</p>
      <p> e) Page: size A4, portrait orientation, top and bottom  margins of 2.54 cm and left and right of 3.00 cm, with a maximum of 15 pages,  including tables and figures. Pages and lines must be numbered; line numbering  must be continuous, i.e., continuing from the previous to the next page.</p>
      <p> f) All the items must be capitalized, in boldface and  centered, except Resumo, Abstract, Palavras-chave and Keywords, which must be  aligned to the left, with only the first letter capitalized. The sub-items must  be aligned to the left, in boldface, with only the first letter capitalized.</p>
      <p> g) Units must be expressed in the ISU (International  System of Units) and the scientific terminology must follow the international  conventions of each area.</p>
      <p> h) Tables and Figures (graphs, maps, images,  photographs, drawings):<br>
        - Tables and figures must be self-explanatory and have  width of 9 or 18 cm, with font Times New Roman, size 9, and inserted right  below the paragraph in which they were cited for the first time. Examples of  citations in the text: Figure 1; Table 1. Tables and figures with virtually the  same title must be grouped in one single table or figure, creating, however, an  indication of differentiation. The indicating letter of each sub-figure in a  grouped figure must be capitalized and followed by a period (Example: A.),  placed in the upper left corner of the figure. Grouped figures must be cited in  the text as follows: Figure 1A; Figure 1B; Figure 1C. Tables and figures with  width of 18 cm will exceed left and right margins of 3.0 cm, which is not a  problem. The total of figures combined with the total of tables must not exceed  6, i.e., a manuscript with 2 tables can have a maximum of 4 figures. However, a  figure resulting from the grouping of many figures will be counted as only one. <br>
        - Tables must not contain vertical dashed lines and  should have the minimum possible of horizontal dashed lines. Numbers in the  columns must be aligned by the last digit. Example of the title, which must be  above the table: Table 1. Selected INMET stations (without a period at the  end). In tables with comparison of means, according to statistical analysis,  there must be a space between the number (mean) and the letter. Units must  appear in parentheses.</p>
      - Figures must not  contain borders, and the curves (in case of graphs) must have a width of 0.5  pt. Figures can be in color, but always using different data markers, because  labels based only on colors will disappear when photocopied. Example of the  title, which must be below the figure: Figure 1. Accumulated soil loss as a  function of the application time of simulated rain (without a period at the  end). In order to avoid redundancy, figures must not contain the data presented  in tables. If the title and the numbering of axis X and/or Y are equal in  grouped figures, only one centered title must be used, with the numbers in only  one axis. Graphs, diagrams (curves in general) must come as a vector image.  Bitmap figures must have a minimum resolution of 300 bpi. The authors should  ensure the quality of resolution, aiming at a good comprehension of the  figures. The units in figure axes must be in parentheses, without being  separated from the title by a comma. The manuscript must not contain figures  with curves for r<sup>2</sup>  lower than 0.60; in these cases, only the equation and the respective r<sup>2</sup>  value must be presented in the manuscript.</td>

    <td width="70%"><p>a) Considering the demand and the publication capacity  of the Journal, only part of the manuscripts submitted each month is selected  by the Editorial Team for analysis, based on the criterion of relative  relevance. For manuscripts not selected for analysis, there will be no  reconsideration of this decision, but they can be submitted again. For the  selected manuscripts, the corresponding author will be requested to provide the  receipt of payment of the submission fee and the indication of three Brazilian  reviewers and three foreign reviewers. These files should be sent through the  SciELO Publication System, as supplementary documents. After receiving these  files, the manuscript is sent to the reviewers for blind analysis (without identification  of the authors). For any information on the course of the manuscript requested  to the Journal Secretariat, authors must provide its identification number,  generated by the SciELO Publication system.</p>
      <p> b) <strong>The articles  will be evaluated by at least three refrees of proven scientific knowledge in  the research area from the national and/or international educational or  research institutions. After the corrections and possible suggestions, the  article will be accepted if there are two favorable opinions and rejected when  two opinions are unfavorable.</strong></p>
      <p> c) The criteria to be judged by the reviewers in the  manuscript are as follows: pertinence of the subject for publication in the  Journal; relevance of the scientific contribution of the manuscript; adequacy  of the title to the objectives of the work; understandable language of the  manuscript; methodology used consistent with the proposed objectives; results  discussed and interpreted appropriately in the light of the literature; succinct  conclusions and in accordance with the results and objectives of the work; and  updating and quality of bibliographic references.</p>
      <p> d) With the help  of the reports and suggestions from the Ad Hoc Reviewers about the first  version of the manuscript, the Editorial Team can reject it or request the  author(s) a second version, which will be analyzed again, both by Ad Hoc  Reviewers and the Editorial Team. In its second version, the manuscript can be rejected,  accepted and/or returned to the author(s) for a third version.</p>
      <p> e) At first, the correction recommendations from Ad  Hoc Reviewers and the Editorial Team on the text of the manuscripts must be  incorporated by the author(s); however, the author(s) has(have) the right to  not accept them, through an explicit justification, which will be analyzed by  the Reviewer(s) and the Editorial Team. The justification  for not accepting the correction recommendations should be inserted at the  beginning of the Word file of the new version of the article, referring to the  respective reviewer or to the Editorial Team.</p>
      <p> f) For rejected manuscripts, a reconsideration request  can be made by the corresponding author, within a maximum period of ten days  from the receipt of the e-mail communicating the manuscript rejection. The  Editorial Team will send the reconsideration request to the respective reviewer  for analysis.</p>
      <p> g) Upon manuscript acceptance, if necessary,  complementary information will be requested to the corresponding author. Then,  the author will receive the manuscript in .pdf format, for a final review, and  must inform the Editorial Team about any eventual correction or alteration.</p>
      <p> h) After publication, any error found by either  authors or readers, when communicated to the Editorial Team, will be corrected  in an errata section in the next issue of the Journal.</p>
      <p>i) The Editorial Team  works to reach standard time to complete an evaluation, between 6 and 8 months.</p></td>
