      <p><strong>Dementia&nbsp;<em>&amp;</em>&nbsp;Neuropsychologia</strong>&nbsp;follows the guidelines of the ICMJE  (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors: Uniform requirements for  manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals editors, updated in December 2014;  available at <a href="http://www.icmje.org/" target="_blank">&nbsp;www.icmje.org</a>)</p>
      <p>In  concert with the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE),&nbsp;<strong>Dementia&nbsp;</strong><strong><em>&amp;</em>&nbsp;Neuropsychologia </strong>requires, as a precondition to be considered for  publication, registration of clinical trials in a public trials registry.  Acceptable trial registries include <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/" target="_blank">http://clinicaltrials.gov</a>,&nbsp;http://isrctn.org,&nbsp;http://actr.org.au,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/index.asp" target="_blank">http://trialregister.nl</a>, and <a href="http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr/" target="_blank">http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr</a>. For this purpose, the  ICMJE defines a clinical trial as any study that prospectively assigns human subjects  to intervention or comparison groups to evaluate the cause-and-effect  relationships between a medical intervention and a health outcome. The trial  registry name, its URL and the registration number should be included at the  end of the abstract. Trials must be registered at or before commencement of  patient enrollment.</p>
      <p>In agreement with BIREME/PAHO/WHO  recommendations for reporting randomized trials, authors are advised to adhere  to the guidelines in the CONSORT STATEMENT (<a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/" target="_blank">www.consort-statement.org</a>).&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Authorship responsibility, criteria, and contributions; financial  disclosure; and copyright transfer.</strong>&nbsp;The cover  letter must include: (1) statement on authorship responsibility; (2) the  contributions of each author to the manuscript, as explained in <strong>Definition of Author&rsquo;s Contribution;</strong> (3) statement on financial disclosure; and (4)  copyright transfer agreement. Each of these first 4 declarations must be read  and signed by all authors (See Authorship Form and model of cover letter at  demneuropsy.org.br).</p>
      <p><strong>Conflict  of interest.</strong>&nbsp;A conflict of interest may exist when an author (or  the author's institution or employer) has financial or personal relationships  that could inappropriately influence (or bias) the author's decisions, work, or  manuscript. Authors are expected to provide  detailed information about any relevant financial interests or financial  conflicts within the past 5 years and for the foreseeable future, particularly  those present at the time the research was conducted and up to the time of  publication. In addition, authors who have no relevant financial interests are  asked to provide a statement indicating that they have no financial interests  related to the material in the manuscript.</p>
      <p>Authors are required to report detailed information regarding all  financial and material support for the research and work, including but not  limited to grant support, funding sources, and provision of equipment and  supplies.</p>
      <p>The policy requesting disclosure of conflicts of interest applies to all  manuscript submissions, including letters to the editor and book reviews.</p>
      <p><strong>Definition  of Author&rsquo;s Contribution </strong><br>
To  be included as an author it is expected that the person has made a significant  intellectual contribution to the manuscript submitted to Dementia <em>&amp; </em>Neuropsychologia.  This contribution may have been in one or more of the items below: <br>
Design of the study<br>
Analysis of the data <br>
Intellectual contribution to the writing of the  manuscript </p>
    <p><strong>Funding/support  and role of sponsor.</strong>&nbsp;All financial and material support for the research  and work should be clearly and fully identified in the acknowledgment.</p>
    <p><strong>Data  access and responsibility.</strong>&nbsp;For clinical trials sponsored by pharmaceutical  companies, authors must state in their letter of  submission that: (1) they have had full access to all the data; (2) they had  the right to publish all the data; and (3) they have had the right to obtain  independent statistical analyses of the data. Manuscripts containing  statistical evaluations should include the name and affiliation of the  statistical reviewer.</p>
    <p><strong>Duplicate previous publication or submission.</strong>&nbsp;Manuscripts  are received on the understanding that they are not under simultaneous  consideration by another journal or title. This information must be included in  the cover letter.</p>
    <p><strong>Informed consent.</strong>&nbsp;For experimental investigations  involving human or animal subjects, state in the &quot;Methods&quot; section of  the manuscript that an appropriate institutional review board has approved the  project. A copy of the approval by the Ethics Committee should be mailed with  the manuscript. For those investigators who do not have access to a formal  ethics review committee (institutional or regional), the principles outlined in  the Declaration of Helsinki should be followed. For investigations of human  subjects, state in the &quot;Methods&quot; section the manner in which informed  consent was obtained from the subjects. A letter of consent must accompany all  photographs of patients in which a possibility of identification exists. It is  not sufficient to cover the eyes to mask identity. Refer to patients by number  (or in anecdotal reports, by assigning fictitious names). Real names or  initials should not be used in the text, tables, or illustrations.</p></td>
