    <p>For  manuscripts accepted for publication written in Portuguese or Spanish, the  translation of the final version into English in the electronic version will be  requested for publication.</p>
    <p>In  addition to the regular volumes, thematic issues may be published, according to  the relevance assessment by REBEn Publishing Committee or Editorial Board. </p>
Manuscripts must be exclusively submitted to <strong>REBEn</strong>, and its simultaneous  submission to any other journals is not allowed. When  published, they become intellectual property of <strong>REBEn</strong>.
   <ul><li><strong>Declaration on Research Ethics and Integrity</strong></li>
 </ul>
   <p>For  publication, <strong>REBEn</strong> considers that the submitted manuscripts must comply with the  ethical-legal guidelines as a <em>sine qua  non</em> condition, which involves the elaboration of academic and/or  technical-scientific papers and research with humans or animals. </p>
   <p>In  the case of research involving human subjects, and in compliance with the provisions of National Health  Council Resolution 466/2012  (<a href="http://aplicacao.saude.gov.br/plataformabrasil/login.jsf">http://aplicacao.saude.gov.br/plataformabrasil/login.jsf</a>), author(s) must  mention the approval of the project in the manuscript by a Research Ethics  Committee recognized by the National Research Ethics Committee, part of  the Brazilian National Council of Health (CONEP-CNS), or by an equivalent body, when conducted  in another country. Likewise,  the procedures adopted to obtain the signature of the Consent Forms by the research participants should be  mentioned in the manuscript.</p>
   <p> REBEn  adopts the requirement of the World Health Organization and the  International Committee for Medical Journal Editors for prior registration of clinical trials (randomized  experimental studies) on a  platform that meets the criteria developed by these two organizations. The registration number of the clinical trial  must appear on the Identification Page of the manuscript, this aspect is  conditional for publication.</p>
   <p>In  experiments involving animals, Law No. 11.,794 of October 8th of 2008, section VII of paragraph 1 of Article 225 of the Federal  Constitution, must be respected, establishing procedures for the scientific use  of animals; In addition, the standards  published in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals  (Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, National Academy of Sciences,  Washington, D.C., USA) of 1996, and the Ethical Principles for Animal Experimentation  (Brazilian College of Animal Experimentation - COBEA, available at: &lt;<a href="http://www.cobea.org.br">www.cobea.org.br</a>&gt;), from 1991 must also be respected. </p>
   <p>REBEn  supports the Recommendations for the  Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical  Journals, from the International  Committee of Medical Journal Editors. These recommendations, regarding  integrity and ethical standards when conducting and reporting a research are  available at the URL &lt;<a href="http://www.icmje.org/urm_main.html" target="_blank">http://www.icmje.org/urm_main.html</a>&gt;. </p>
   <p> Likewise,  we also support the international standards for responsible research  publication developed by COPE (Committee on Publication Ethics) and intended  for publishers and authors (available in: &lt;<a href="http://publicationethics.org/international-standards-editors-and-authors" target="_blank">http://publicationethics.org/international-standards-editors-and-authors</a>&gt;). </p>

<p>Whatever  the type of illustration, its identification appears in the upper part,  preceded by the designative word (box, figure, table) followed by the order  number of its occurrence in the text, in Arabic numerals, indent and its title  Table 1 - title). After the illustration, at the bottom, insert the caption,  notes and other information necessary for your understanding, if any (see: ABNT  NBR 14724/2011 - Information and documentation - Academic work - Presentation). <strong>The source consulted should be included  below the figure only if it is secondary data.</strong></p>
<p>The  tables should be standardized according to recommendations of the Brazilian  Institute of Geography and Statistics - IBGE. Tabular presentation rules. 3.ed.  Rio de Janeiro, 1993, available in http://biblioteca.ibge.gov.br/visualizacao/livros/liv23907.pdf</p>

  <td width="70%"><p>The Manuscripts must be submitted to the  REBEn at URL &lt;<a href="http://www.scielo.br/reben/">http://www.scielo.br/reben/</a>&gt;, accessing the <a href="http://www.scielo.br/revistas/reben/checklist_en.pdf">Submission Online</a>.</p>
    <p>Before submitting the manuscript, the authors must verify the standards of REBEn, strictly  follow the <a href="http://www.scielo.br/revistas/reben/checklist_en.pdf" target="_blank"><em>check  list</em></a><u><em> </em></u>and have all the necessary documents for  submission. The completion of the metadata in the submission form is mandatory.</p>
    <p>Each  document must be attached separately in the field indicated by the system.</p>
    <p>
      To  initiate the process, the responsible person must be previously registered in  the system as author creating/associating the ORCID (Open Researcher and  Contributor ID) registry. The system is self-explanatory and, at the end of the  process, an ID will be generated for the manuscript, with numeric code  (Example: REBEn 2017-0001). The submitter will receive a message stating the  URL of the manuscript and a login so that s/he can follow the progress of the  manuscript in the steps of the editorial process in the system administration  interface.</p>
    <p>In  step 4 of the submission, the authors should indicate four possible reviewers  for manuscript evaluation. These nominees must have a PhD and must have no  conflict of interest. Reviewers may or may not be complied with by the  associated editors. The reviewers can be located on the <a href="http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/busca.do?metodo">platform lattes </a>according to the topic of the manuscript. </p>
    <p>We  remind you that failure to comply with all these instructions will result in  the return of the documents for adequacy, causing a greater delay in the  appreciation by the editors. </p>
    <p><strong>Peer review process</strong></p>
    <p>Initially,  the editors evaluate the fulfillment of the norms for preparation of  manuscripts; The inclusion of the registration number of the clinical trial,  when applicable, Vancouver-style in the preparation of the reference list; The  clarity and objectivity of the abstract; The inclusion of the descriptors  chosen among DeCS (<em>Descritores em  Ci&ecirc;ncias da Sa&uacute;de</em>) and MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms; And the  potential of the manuscript for publication and possible readers' interest.</p>
When one of these aspects is not considered  satisfactory, the manuscript is rejected and automatically archived in the  system. When evaluated positively, the manuscript is sent to peer review,  adopting the double blind review, which seeks to guarantee the anonymity of the  authors and the evaluators. The opinions issued by the reviewers may consider  the manuscript accepted, rejected or requiring revisions, either in standards  or content. The opinions issued by the evaluators are evaluated by the Chief  Editors, and a final decision is sent to the authors.
