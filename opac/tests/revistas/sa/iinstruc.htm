To submit <a href="http://www.esalq.usp.br/scientia/docs/Reviews-ingles.pdf" target="_blank">reviews</a> the authors should check the specific instructions. As these pages are updated periodically, it is strongly recommended that you read them even if you have done so previously.</li>
  <li>Please read the <a href="http://www.esalq.usp.br/scientia/docs/Checklist-Ingles.pdf">checklist</a> carefully before submitting your manuscript.</li>

  <li>Authors should submit manuscripts through the online system at,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.scielo.br/sa" target="_blank">http://www.scielo.br/sa</a>, by clicking on &quot;submiss&atilde;o online&quot;.</li>

<p><strong>COMPLEMENTARY  INFORMATION</strong></p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Manuscripts that evaluate the bioactivity of chemical and/or biological products, including growth regulators of insects, spiders, fungi, bacteria, nematodes, and weeds, will not be considered for publication in&nbsp;<strong><em>Scientia Agricola</em></strong>.</li>
  <li>Manuscripts that evaluate tissue culture improvements or protocols based on tests of additives, explants, or growth conditions, or that fail to demonstrate a substantial improvement that could not be deduced from the existent literature, will no longer be considered for publication in&nbsp;<strong><em>Scientia Agricola</em></strong>.</li>
  <li>Manuscripts       based on a single field experiment will not be considered as suitable for       publication in <em>Scientia Agricola</em>,       except when the authors can prove the high relevance and novelty of the       study. Even manuscripts with more than one field experiment will be       subjected to immediate rejection if the data collected do not have enough       variability to achieve conclusive results.</li>
  <li>Manuscripts       that report first occurrences or are simple descriptions of pests,       pathogens, and diseases will generally not be considered for publication       in <em>Scientia Agricola</em>.       Exceptionally,&nbsp;these manuscripts could be considered in the NOTE       format when: 1) reported organisms are of high relevance to agriculture;       2) the data are originated from a broad survey; and 3) organisms/problems       are characterized extensively by means of several methods and aspects       under investigation.</li>
  <li>Manuscripts  that involve experimentation with living animals (including humans beings) must  provide evidences that they were performed in accordance with local ethical  guidelines. Authors are expected to adhere to established ethical best  practices. These evidences must be officially stated in the “Materials and  Methods” section, describing that the study was evaluated and approved by an  appropriate ethical committee (including the process number).</li>
  <li>Manuscripts must follow the criteria established by the International Codes of each area.</li>
  <li>Opinions and concepts expressed in the articles are the authors' exclusive responsibility.</li>
<li>All submitted manuscripts will be  subjected to the journal&rsquo;s policy of screening for plagiarism and  self-plagiarism.</li></ul>
<p><strong>References</strong></p>
<p>Scientia  Agricola does not allow authors to cite congress or workshop abstracts,  technical articles, dissertations and theses. References in Portuguese or any  language other than English should be limited to those essentially important to  the study. Up to four references written in languages other than English will  be allowed without justifications. More than that will only be allowed if the  authors explain the reasons for keeping them in the text. If allowed by the  Editor-in-Chief, these extra references must be cited in English with the text  in the original language provided at the end of the reference, in the following  format: (in Portuguese, with abstract in English)</p>
<p><em>Scientia Agricola</em>&nbsp;does not recommend that authors cite statistical  analyses or software packages as references.

<p>
  <strong>5.&nbsp;</strong>Order  multiple citations 'same author-same date' with the aid of lower case letters,  e.g.: (Cyrino, 2004a, b).</p>
<p><strong>6.&nbsp;</strong>Use the  &quot;author-year&quot; style to format the list of references, and: (i) do not  abbreviate any other words apart from the first and middle names of authors;  (ii) use all capitals only for acronyms, i.e., when the author is an  organization; (iii) name all authors and capitalize authors' last name and  initials, which should be separated by a period (.); (iv) separate authors by  semicolon; (v) do not use ampersands (&amp;) in the citations nor in the  reference list; (vi) do not use bold characters to highlight any part of the  reference; (vii) capitalize books and periodical titles; (viii) do not use a  comma (,) to separate the title and volume of a periodical; (ix) separate the  periodical volume from the page numbers with a colon (:); (x) use full page  numbering; (xi) separate page numbers with a dash (-); (xii) separate page  groups by a comma if the article was published in discontinuous pages; (xiii)  indicate the number of a given edition of a book or manual, e.g.,  &quot;2ed&quot;; (xiv) for books and manuals, indicate the publisher or  editorial office before the main locality of the publisher or editorial office;  (xv) separate publishers or editorial offices from locality with a comma; and  (xvi) in such cases, name city, state and/or province and country.</p>
