      <p>Original scientific studies and communications, not  yet published or submitted to another journal for publication and written in  Portuguese or English, will be accepted for publication. For manuscripts submitted  in English, the authors should provide an adequated version. </p>
      <p>The SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION is a category of scientific manuscript which 
        describes a technique, an equipment, new species or observations and surveys 
        of limited results. It has the same scientific rigor as the &quot;Scientific 
        Articles&quot; and the same value as a publication. The classification 
        of a manuscript as a SCIENTIFIC COMMUNICATION is based on its content 
        and scientific merit but it can be a preliminary study, simple and not 
        definitive on a certain subject, with publication justified by its uniqueness 
        and contribution to the area. </p>
      <p><b>Its aims are</b>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To publish original articles in thematic areas relevant to Seed Technology; 
        <li>To publish articles that significantly contribute towards the knowledge 
          of this area, featuring a scientific stance and in-depth knowledge on 
          themes and trends within Seed Technology; 
        <li>To provide a strict evaluation policy with articles sent for publication; 
          each manuscript is evaluated by two reviewers who are carefully selected 
          from the scientific community. The acceptance of article is the result 
          of the revisers' assessment and of the editors concerned; 
        <li>To maintain a high ethical behavior with regard to the review and 
          its collaborators; 
        <li>To maintain strict quality in scientific article to be published. 
      </ul>
      <p>The articles  will be published in the order they are approved. The Editorial Committee will  make a preliminary evaluation of the manuscript submitted and accept it for  publication or not, according to the journal's policy and criteria of relevance.  After initial acceptance, the EDITOR will designate an ASSOCIATE EDITOR (of the  area), who will proceed to edit with the help of at least two SCIENTIFIC  ASSESSORS of JSS,  who has the same prerogatives to accept the manuscript for publication or not.  The whole editorial process will be accompanied by the authors, assessors or  associate editors, through the use of an access code (login) and password,  given at the beginning of the submission process.</p>
      <p>The data, opinions and concepts emitted in the articles, as well as the 
        accuracy of the bibliographic references, are the entire responsibility 
        of the author(s). The eventual quoting of products and commercial brands 
        does not mean that ABRATES recommends their use. However, the EDITOR, 
        with the help of the Editorial Committee and the Scientific Assessors, 
        reserves the right to suggest or request advisable or necessary changes. 
      </p>
      <p><b>Publication Fees</b></p>
      <p>The payment of  an article publication fee is obligatory for all authors, including members of  ABRATES (one of the authors  should be member), and will be as follows from January 2013:</p>
      <p> For members of ABRATES - Up to six printed pages in  final form: R$ 30,00 per page + R$ 80,00 per additional page - Page in color:  R$ 100,00 - Additional example: R$ 30,00.</p>
      <p> For non-members - Up to six printed pages in final  form: R$ 60,00 per page + R$ 160,00 per additional page - Page in color: R$ 200,00  - Additional example: R$ 60,00. </p>
      <p>In the case of more than one author, including members, the total value 
        will be divided between the number of authors, but only the members whose 
        dues are paid up-to-date will have a 50% discount of their part. Payment 
        of a submission or administrative fee will no longer be necessary.</p>

      <p>The advice given in these instructions should be followed in full by 
        the author(s).</p>
      <p>The manuscripts  should be organized into a SHORT  TITLE (centrally placed at the beginning of the first page), TITLE (in english),  AUTHORS, ABSTRACT (<b>up to 200 words</b>),  TITLE (in portuguese), RESUMO (abstract in Portuguese - <b>up to 200 words</b>), INTRODUCTION, MATERIAL AND METHODS,  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS, ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS AND REFERENCES. The ABSTRACT and the RESUMO  must also contain no more than five &quot;Index Terms&quot; (&ldquo;Termos para indexa&ccedil;&atilde;o&rdquo;), which are  not cited in the title.</p>
      <p>The following norms should be adhered to when preparing the manuscript:</p>
      <p>The manuscripts should be typed in Word text editor (DOC or RTF) in numbered 
        lines (up to 30 lines per page) with double spacing and 2cm margins, with 
        Times New Roman 14 font for the title and 12 for the text, without the 
        inclusion of tables and figures, which will be annexed at the end of the 
        manuscript. The figures should be in programs compatible with WINDOWS, 
        such as EXCEL, and the image format: Figures (GIF or TIFF) and Photos 
        (JPEG) with 300 dpi resolution.</p>
      <p>The manuscript&nbsp;<b>should not be longer than 20  pages</b>, including figures, tables and references. Manuscripts longer than 20  pages will be returned. </p>
      <p>The writing of the manuscripts should be concise, objective and clear, 
        written impersonally in the past, except for the conclusions which should 
        be written in the present tense.</p>
      <p>Paragraphs will  not be permitted in the ABSTRACT  or the RESUMO nor the presentation of data in columns or tables or the  inclusion of bibliographic references.</p>
      <p>The full name(s) of the author(s) should be mentioned immediately below 
        the title. The corresponding author has to be identified by an asterisk 
        and an e-mail must be provided. The notes should be placed on the foot 
        of the page, which has the respective superscripted number of each author 
        indicating his/her institutional affiliation and address - Department 
        or Section, Institution, Post office box, Zip code, Municipality and Country.</p>
      <p><b>Text Citations</b>: the citations of authors in the text will be by 
        the surname with only the first letter as a capital, followed by the year 
        of publication. In the case of two authors, both surnames will be included, 
        separated by &quot;and&quot;; if there are more than two authors, only 
        the first will be cited, followed by &quot;et al.&quot;. In the case of 
        the citation of two or more publications of the same author(s), published 
        in the same year, they should be identified by small letters (a,b,c, etc.), 
        placed immediately after the year of publication. </p>
      <p><b>References</b>: sixty percent (60%) of  the references should have been listed on the database ISI Web of Knowledge,  Scopus or SciELO during the last 10 years. </p>
      <p><b>Citations from theses, dissertations, monographs, proceedings or annals 
        of congress, abstracts, and magazines will not be accepted.</b></p>
      <p><b>Avoid: </b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>excessive citations of textbooks; 
        <li>obsolete citations and informative magazines which are not scientific. 
          Citations of recent articles published in the RBS can be accessed at 
          the site: <a href="www.scielo.br/rbs" target="_blank">www.scielo.br/rbs</a> 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The references should be given in alphabetical order by the surname of 
        the first author, without numbering; mention all the authors of the article 
        separated by &quot;;&quot;. Follow the norms of the ABNT NBR6023. The 
        references should have hyperlinks to permit access to any Web page on 
        the internet. With the cursor placed on the desired spot of a text or 
        spreadsheet, type the address of the page e.g.: <a href="http://www.abrates.org.br" target="_blank">www.abrates.org.br</a> 
        and press the space bar. The hyperlink will be automatically created. 
        Position the cursor on one of the letters of the hyperlink which was created, 
        press Shift F10 to open the menu, move the arrow down until the option 
        to open the hyperlink, press enter and the page will open. </p>
