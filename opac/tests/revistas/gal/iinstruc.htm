      <p>The journal has a scientific council and a group  of peer reviewers <em>ad hoc</em> composed of  renowned experts in the thematic areas of Communication Science. &nbsp;The  scientific council is composed of thematic and editorial members of the  journal, who are also reviewers. However, when specific expertise is needed,  depending on the topic of the article, the editor may summon reviewers <em>ad hoc</em>.&nbsp; The selection process  involves the evaluation of articles by two or three experts. &nbsp;The selection  of reviews and news will be made by members of the scientific council, but is  open to suggestions from the entire scientific community. Each article is sent  to two reviewers, in the blind peer review process (<em>blind peer review</em>).&nbsp;&nbsp; If one of the reviewers approves a  manuscript and the other does not recommend its publication, the manuscript is  submitted to a third opinion, after due review. This opinion breaks the tie.  &nbsp;Any manuscript, Brazilian or foreign, is subjected to the same system of  evaluation.</p>
