        to the concerns of the editors of scientific medical journals with ethics, 
        quality and seriousness of published articles, a Committee on Publication 
        Ethics (COPE) was established in 1997 and a guideline document was published. 
        The International Braz J Urol signed, approved, and follows the COPE guidelines. 
        The Editor strongly encourages the authors to carefully read these guidelines 
        before submitting a manuscript (<a href="http://www.publicationethics.org.uk/guidelines" target="_blank">www.publicationethics.org.uk/guidelines</a>

        revisions, the manuscript is always sent to 1 or 2 additional Reviewers 
        before the Editor&#8217;s decision. If considered necessary by the Editor
