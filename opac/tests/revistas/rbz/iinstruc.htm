    <td width="70%"><p><b>Scope</b></p>
      <p><b>Revista  Brasileira de Zootecnia</b>-Brazilian Journal of Animal Science (RBZ)  encompasses all  fields of Animal Science Research. The RBZ publishes  original scientific articles in the areas of Aquaculture; Biometeorology and Animal Welfare; Forage; Animal  Genetics and Breeding, Animal Reproduction; Ruminant and Non-Ruminant  Nutrition; Animal Production Systems and Agribusiness.</p>
      <p><b>Open  access and peer review</b></p>
      <p>The RBZ is sponsored by the Brazilian Society of  Animal Science, which provides readers or their institutions with free access to  peer-reviewed articles published online by RBZ. Users have the right to read,  download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of  articles.  <b>Revista Brasileira de  Zootecnia</b> is included in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ).</p>
      <p>All the contents of this journal, except  where otherwise noted, are licensed under a Creative Commons attribution-type BY (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a>),  which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium,  provided the original work is properly cited.</p>
      <p>A peer-review system is exerted on  manuscripts sent for appreciation to maintain standards of quality, improve  performance, and provide credibility. We use the double-blind style of  reviewing by concealing the identity of the authors from the reviewers, and  vice versa. Communication with authors should  only be through the Scientific Editor (named as Editor-in-chief). Authors are  given the chance to designate names to be considered by the Editor-in-chief as  preferred or non-preferred reviewers. Reviewers should notify the editor about  conflicts of interest (either positive or negative) that may compromise their  ability to provide a fair and an unbiased review.</p>
      <p><b>Assurance  of contents and assignment of copyright</b></p>
      <p>When submitting a manuscript for review,  authors should make sure that the results of the work are original, and that  the total or partial content of the manuscript, regardless of the language, has  not been/ is not being considered for publication in any other scientific  journal. Additionally, the authors assure that if they have used the work  and/or words of others this has been appropriately cited or quoted warranting  absence of plagiarism, which constitutes unethical publishing behavior.</p>
      <p>Papers already published or that have been  submitted to any other journal will not be accepted. Fractioned or subdivided  studies should be submitted together because they will be assigned to the same  reviewers.</p>
      <p>The content of the articles published by <b>Revista Brasileira de Zootecnia</b> is of  sole responsibility of their authors.</p>
      <p>Authors who have a manuscript approved by RBZ  are also requested to authorize that the right of total or partial electronic  and graphic reproduction (copyright) of the paper be transferred to the  Brazilian Society of Animal Science, which ensure us the rights necessary for  the proper administration of electronic rights and online dissemination of  journal articles.</p>
      <p>After completing the submission of the  manuscript by using the Manuscript Central&trade; online system, the corresponding  author will be asked to email the file  named Assurance of Contents and Copyright and will be responsible for stating the information required in the document  regarding the manuscript and all co-authors. A  template with the same name has been already prepared by the Brazilian Society  of Animal Science and is available on the journal website at <a href="http://www.revista.sbz.org.br/assurance-of-contents/?idiom=en" target="_blank">http://www.revista.sbz.org.br/assurance-of-contents/?idiom=en</a>.</p>
      <p>The original text of the template must not be  altered but only completed with the necessary information. The corresponding author must fill it out properly, sign  it, initial all pages, scan and email it to RBZ&rsquo;s office e-mail address <a href="mailto:secretariarbz@sbz.org.br">secretariarbz@sbz.org.br</a> confirming all authors&rsquo;  participation in the manuscript.</p>
      <p>The manuscript will not be considered for  peer reviewing without this form. The deadline will be set allowing a period of  15 days for delivery of forms after which the editorial office will act by withdrawing  the manuscript.</p>
      <p><b>Language</b></p>
      <p>Submissions will only be accepted in the English  language (either American or British spelling). The editorial board of RBZ  reserves the right to demand that authors revise the translation or to cancel  the processing of the manuscript if the English version submitted contains  errors of spelling, punctuation, grammar, terminology, jargons or semantics  that can either compromise good understanding or not follow the Journal's  standards.  It is strongly recommended that the translation process be performed by a  professional experienced in scientific writing familiar with Animal Science,  preferably a native speaker of English.</p>
      <p><b>Publication  costs</b></p>
      <p><strong>Processing fee</strong></p>
      <p>The payment of the processing fee is a  prerequisite for submitting manuscripts to referees. The processing fee is of  R$ 53.00 (Fifty-three reals and no cents) for both members and non-members of  the Brazilian Society of Animal Science (BSAS). Payment must be done according  to guidance available on the SBZ website (<a href="http://www.sbz.org.br">www.sbz.org.br</a>).</p>
      <p><strong>Publication fee</strong></p>
      <p>Revista Brasileira de Zootecnia adopt an Open  Access policy and OA articles are freely accessible through the journal&rsquo;s  website at <a href="http://www.scielo.br/rbz" target="_blank">http://www.scielo.br/rbz</a> at the time of  publication. The current article publication fee in the journal is of R$ 160.00  (One hundred and sixty reals and no cents) per page if at least one author is a  member of the BSAS. The member must be the first author or the corresponding  author of the manuscript. If no authors are BSAS members, the publication fee  is of R$ 260.00 (Two hundred and sixty reals and no cents) per journal page.  The Real is the present-day currency of Brazil. Its sign is R$.</p>
      <p><b>Care and  use of animals</b></p>
      <p><b>Revista Brasileira de Zootecnia</b>&nbsp;is committed to the highest  ethical standards of animal care and use. Research presented in manuscripts  reporting the use of animals must guarantee to have been conducted in  accordance with applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and  policies governing the care and use of animals. The author should ensure that the manuscript contains a statement that  all procedures were performed in compliance with relevant laws and  institutional guidelines and, whenever pertinent, that the appropriate  institutional committee(s) has approved them before commencement of the study.</p>
      <p><b>Types of articles</b></p>
      <p><b>Full-length research article: </b>A  full-length research paper provides a complete account of the experimental  work. The text should represent the research process and foster its cohesive  understanding and a coherent explanation regarding all the experimental  procedures and results and must provide the minimal information necessary for  an independent reproduction of the research. </p>
      <p><b>Short communication: </b>A  succinct account of the final results of an experimental work, which has full  justification for publication, although with a volume of information which is  not sufficient to be considered a full-length research article. The results  used as the basis to prepare the short communication cannot be used  subsequently, neither partially nor wholly, for the presentation of a  full-length article.</p>
      <p><b>Technical note: </b>An evaluation report  or proposition of a method, procedure or technique that correlates with the  scope of RBZ. Whenever possible, one should show the advantages and  disadvantages of the new method, procedure or technique proposed, as well as  its comparison with those previously or currently employed, presenting the  proper scientific rigor in analysis, comparison, and discussion of results.</p>
      <p><b>Board-invited reviews: </b>An approach   that represents state-of-the-art  or critical view of issues of interest and  relevance to the scientific community. It can only be submitted by invitation  of the editorial board of RBZ. The invited reviews will be subjected to the  peer-review process.</p>
      <p><b>Editorial: </b>Notes to clarify and  establish technical guidelines and/or philosophy for designing and making of  articles to be submitted and evaluated by RBZ. The editorials will be drafted  by or at the invitation of the editorial board of RBZ.</p></td>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="15%"></td>
    <td width="70%"><p><b>Structure  of a full-length research article </b></p>
      <p>Figures, Tables, and Acknowledgments should  be sent as separated files and not as part of the body of the manuscript.</p>
      <p>The article is divided into sections with centered  headings, in bold, in the following order: Abstract, Introduction, Material and  Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusions,  Acknowledgments (optional) and References. The heading is not followed by  punctuation.</p>
      <p><b>Manuscript  format</b></p>
      <p>The text should be typed by using Times New  Roman font at 12 points, double-space (except for Abstract and Tables, which  should be set at 1.5 space), and top, bottom, left and right margins of 2.5, 2.5,  3.5, and 2.5 cm, respectively.</p>
      <p>The text should contain up to 25 pages,  sequentially numbered in arabic numbers at the bottom. The file must be edited by using Microsoft Word<sup>&reg;</sup> software.</p>
      <p><b>Title</b></p>
      <p>The title should be precise and informative,  with no more than 20 words. It should be typed in bold and centered as the  example: Nutritional value of sugar cane for ruminants. Names of sponsor of  grants for the research should always be presented in the Acknowledgments  section. </p>
      <p><b>Authors</b></p>
      <p>The name and institutions of authors will be  requested at the submission process; therefore they should  not be presented in the body of the manuscript. Please see the topic Guidelines  to submit the manuscript for details.</p>
      <p>The listed authors should be no more than  eight.</p>
      <p>The list of authors must contain all authors&rsquo; full  name with no initials, current email address, and complete information about  their afiliation. This list must follow the same authorship order presented in  the Assurance of Contents and Copyright.</p>
      <p>Spurious and "ghost" authorships constitute  an unethical behavior. Collaborative inputs, hand labor, and other types of  work that do not imply intellectual contribution may be mentioned in the  Acknowledgments section. </p>
      <p><b>Abstract</b></p>
      <p>The abstract should contain no more than  1,800 characters including spaces in a single paragraph. The information in the  abstract must be precise. Extensive abstracts will be returned to be adequate  with the guidelines.</p>
      <p>The abstract should summarize the objective,  material and methods, results and conclusions. It should not contain any  introduction. References are never cited in the abstract.</p>
      <p>The text should be justified and typed at 1.5 space  and come at the beginning of the manuscript with the word ABSTRACT  capitalized, and initiated at 1.0 cm from the left margin. To avoid redundancy  the presentation of significance levels of probability is not allowed  in this  section. </p>
      <p><b>Key Words </b></p>
      <p>At the end of the abstract list at least  three and no more than six key words, set off by commas and presented in  alphabetical order. They should be elaborated so that the article is quickly found  in bibliographical research. The key words should be justified and typed in  lowercase. There must be no period mark after key words. </p>
      <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
      <p>The introduction should not exceed 2,500  characters with spaces, briefly summarizing the context of the subject, the  justifications for the research and its objectives; otherwise it will be  rerouted for adaptation. Discussion based on references to support a specific  concept should be avoided in the introduction. </p>
      <p>Inferences on results obtained should be  presented in the Discussion section.</p>
      <p><b>Material  and Methods</b></p>
      <p>Whenever applicable, describe at the  beginning of the section that the work was conducted in accordance with ethical  standards and approved by the Ethics and Biosafety Committee of the  institution.</p>
      <p>Please  provide ethics comittee number as follows: &ldquo;Research on animals was conducted  according to the institutional committee on animal use (protocol number).</p>
      <p>As for the location of the  experiment, it should contain city, state, country, and geographical  coordinates (latitude, longitude, elevation). Names of universities,  laboratories, farms or any other intitutions must not be mentioned. </p>
      <p>A clear description on the specific original  reference is required for biological, analytical and statistical procedures.  Any modifications in those procedures must be explained in detail.</p>
      <p>The presentation of the statistical model as a  separate sentence from the text and as a numbered equation is mandatory  whenever the research is about designed experiments, observational studies or  survey studies. All terms, assumptions, and fitting procedures must be fully  described to allow readers for a correct identification of the experimental  unit.</p>
      <p><b>Results</b></p>
      <p>The author must write two sections by separating  results and discussion. In the Results section, sufficient data, with means and some measure of uncertainty (standard  error, coefficient of variation, confidence intervals, etc.) are mandatory, to  provide the reader with the power to interpret the results of the experiment  and make his own judgment. The additional guidelines for styles and units of  RBZ should be checked for the correct understanding of the exposure of results  in tables. The Results section cannot contain references.</p>
      <p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
      <p>In the Discussion section, the author should  discuss the results clearly and concisely and integrate the findings with the  literature published to provide the reader with a broad base on which they will  accept or reject the author's hypothesis.</p>
      <p>Loose paragraphs and references presenting  weak relationship with the problem being discussed must be avoided. Neither  speculative ideas nor propositions about the hypothesis or hypotheses under  study are encouraged. </p>
      <p><b>Conclusions</b></p>
      <p>Be absolutely certain that this section highlights  what is new and the strongest and most important inferences that can be drawn  from your observations. Include the broader implications of your results. The  conclusions are stated by using the present tense. </p>
      <p>Do not present results in the conclusions, except when  they are strictly important for the generalization.</p>
      <p><b>Acknowledgments</b> </p>
      <p>This section is optional. It must come right  after the conclusions.</p>
      <p>The Acknowledgments section  must not be  included in the body of the manuscript; instead, a file named Acknowledgment  should be prepared and then uploaded as &ldquo;supplemental file NOT for review&rdquo;. This procedure helps RBZ to conceal the identity of authors from  the reviewers. </p>
      <p><b>Use of  abbreviations</b></p>
      <p>Author-derived abbreviations should be  defined at first use in the abstract, and again in the body of the manuscript,  and in each table and figure in which they are used. </p>
      <p>The use of author-defined abbreviations and  acronyms should be avoided, as for instance: T3 was higher than T4, which did  not differ from T5 and T6. This type of writing is appropriate for the author,  but of complex understanding by the readers, and characterizes a verbose and  imprecise writing. </p>
      <p><b>Tables  and Figures</b> </p>
      <p>It is essential that tables be built by option  "Insert Table" in distinct cells, on Microsoft Word&reg; menu (No tables  with values separated by the ENTER key or pasted as figure will be accepted).  Tables and figures prepared by other means will be rerouted to author for  adequacy to the journal guidelines.</p>
      <p>Tables and figures should  be numbered sequentially in Arabic numerals, presented in two separate editable files to be uploaded (one for the tables and  one for the figures), and must not appear in the  body of the manuscript. They may be uploaded  separately and in a higher number of files if the size of the files hampers the upload.
      </p>
      <p>The title of the tables and figures should be  short and informative, and the descriptions of the variables in the body of the  table should be avoided.</p>
      <p>In the graphs, designations of the variables  on the X and Y axes should have their initials in capital letters and the units  in parentheses.</p>
      <p>Non-original figures, i.e., figures published  elsewhere, are only allowed to be published in RBZ with the express written  consent of the publisher or copyright owner. It should contain, after the  title, the source from where they were extracted, which must be cited.</p>
      <p>The units and font (Times New Roman) in the body  of the figures should be standardized.</p>
      <p>The curves must be identified in the figure  itself. Excessive information that compromises the understanding of the graph  should be avoided.</p>
      <p>Use contrasting markers such as circles,  crosses, squares, triangles or diamonds (full or empty) to represent points of  curves in the graph.</p>
      <p>Figures should be built by using Microsoft Excel&reg;  to allow corrections during copyediting, and uploaded as a separate editable  Microsoft Word&reg; file, named &ldquo;Figures&rdquo; during submission. Use lines  with at least 3/4 width. Figures should be used only in monochrome and without  any 3-D or shade effects. Do not use bold in the figures.</p>
      <p>The decimal numbers presented within the  tables and figures must contain a point, not a comma mark.</p>
      <p>Mathematical formulas and equations must be  inserted in the text as an object and by using Microsoft Equation or a similar  tool. </p>
      <p><b>References</b></p>
      <p>Reference and citations should follow the  Name and Year System (Author-date).</p>
      <p><b>Citations  in the text</b></p>
      <p>The author's citations in the text are in  lowercase, followed by year of publication. In the case of two authors, use  &lsquo;and'; in the case of three or more authors, cite only the surname of the first  author, followed by the abbreviation et al.</p>
      <p>Examples:<br>
        Single author: Silva (2009) or (Silva, 2009)<br>
        Two authors: Silva and Queiroz (2002) or  (Silva and Queiroz, 2002) <br>
        Three or more authors: Lima et al. (2001) or  (Lima et al., 2001) </p>
      <p>The references should be arranged  chronologically and then alphabetically within a year, using a semicolon (;) to  separate multiple citations within parentheses, e.g.: (Carvalho, 1985; Britto,  1998; Carvalho et al., 2001).</p>
      <p>Two or more publications by the same author  or group of authors in the same year shall be differentiated by adding  lowercase letters after the date, e.g., (Silva, 2004a,b).</p>
      <p>Personal communication can only be used if  strictly necessary for the development or understanding of the study.  Therefore, it is not part of the reference list, so it is placed only as a  footnote. The author's last name and first and middle initials, followed by the  phrase "personal communication", the date of notification, name, state and  country of the institution to which the author is bound. </p>
      <p><b>References  section</b></p>
      References  should be written on a separate page, and by alphabetical order of surname of  author(s), and then chronologically.
      <p>Type them single-spaced, justified, and indented to the third letter of the  first word from the second line of reference.</p>
      <p>All  authors' names must appear in the References section.</p>
      <p>The  author is indicated by their last name followed by initials. Initials should be  followed by period (.) and space; and the authors should be separated by  semicolons. The word &lsquo;and' precedes the citation of the last author.</p>
      <p>Surnames  with indications of relatedness (Filho, Jr., Neto, Sobrinho, etc.) should be  spelled out after the last name (e.g., Silva Sobrinho, J.). </p>
      <p>Do  not use ampersand (&amp;) in the citations or in the reference list.</p>
      <p>As in text citations, multiple citations of same  author or group of authors in the same year shall be differentiated by adding  lowercase letters after the date. </p>
      <p>In  the case of homonyms of cities, add the name of the state and country (e.g., Gainesville, FL, EUA; Gainesville, VA,  EUA).</p>
      <p>Sample  references are given below.</p>
      <p><b>Articles&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b></p>
      <p>The journal name should be written in full.  In order to standardize this type of reference, it is not necessary to quote  the website, only volume, page range and year. Do not use a comma (,) to  separate journal title from its volume; separate periodical volume from page  numbers by a colon (:).</p>
