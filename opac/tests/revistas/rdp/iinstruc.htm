      <p>The journal publishes academic papers on  Theory and Philosophy of Law, Sociology of Law and Political Philosophy, and  also interdisciplinary research based on critical methodologies and approaches. <br>
      <br>
Articles submitted to the Law and Praxis  journal go through a double blind review process performed on average between 60  and 120 days after submission. The referees may consider the article approved  (and still make suggestions), demand compulsory adjustments (which will be sent  to the author and returned to the referee for a conference) or refuse  publication. In order to be approved for publication, the article cannot  receive any rejections. On the other hand, an article whose reviewer&rsquo;s opinion  requires mandatory edits may be published. Return to authors: After evaluation,  articles are returned to authors for corrections. Once those are made, there  are two conferences: one by the referee and another by the executive committee  for effective certification. The editorial committee decides about the order of  publication and finalizes the selection. Law and Praxis&rsquo; issues are published  quarterly in March, June, September and December of each year.<br><br>

        Direito e Pr&aacute;xis Journal publishes articles,  translations, reviews and articles in special issue. The policies of each  section are:
      <br><br>

      <strong>Articles</strong><br>
        Direito e Pr&aacute;xis welcomes the submission of  papers written in English, Spanish and Portuguese. They must be original and  unpublished. The section's goal is the diffusion of researches and experiments  on human rights, both empirical and theoretical, formulated on critical and  interdisciplinary bases. The contributions are concentrated in the areas of  Theory and Philosophy of Law, Sociology and Human Rights.<br><br>

        <strong> Translations</strong><br>
        This section receives and publishes  translations of scientific papers. Once submitted, translations will be  evaluated by the Editorial Board for verification of thematic relevance and  analysis of the translation. Sending of the original text is desirable.<br>
<br>

        <strong> Dossier</strong><br>
        Quarterly publication of thematic dossiers  organized by the editorial staff of the Journal and by expert guest editors.<br><br>

        <strong>Review</strong><br>
The Law and Praxis journal welcomes the submission of  reviews about books published in the last two years, at most. The reviews can  be written in the languages accepted by the journal, namely Portuguese, English  or Spanish. Once submitted, the reviews will be evaluated by the Journal`s  Editorial Committee, which will analyze the pertinence of the publication  considering (i) the relevance of the work, (ii) the quality and critical  approach of the review, and finally, (iii) the relevance of the work in relation  to the scope of the journal. Reviews must be 4-10 pages long. The same formal  rules for papers are applicable. </p>
