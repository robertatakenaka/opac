      <p>The RBCE (ISSN 0101-3289; eISSN 2179-3255) publishes original articles in Portuguese, 

        Spanish or English stemming from research involving in-depth, theoretical 

        reflection and/or rigorous empirical investigation, as well as review 

        articles and reviews. Although submission is free, the journal also adopts 

        the policy of inviting renowned and consolidated researchers in the ambit 

        of Sports Sciences/Physical Education (including from abroad) to promote 

        their studies in its pages, and the works from abroad shall not exceed 

        20% of content. The RBCE has no restrictions as to submission of articles 

        presented at scientific events (as long as submitted as per publication 

        norms and evaluation), and it does not imply the practice of publishing 

        scientific articles translated from foreign journals.</p>

      <p>In relation to its evaluation policy, the RBCE has a group of proofreaders 

        and ad hoc specialists (referees) in Physical Education/Sports Sciences 

        and similar areas. Those manuscripts that meet author instructions are 

        submitted, completely suppressing author identification, to the Editorial 

        Council and ad hoc proofreaders who shall assess the work observing the 

        peer-review system. Those studies that receive disagreeing evaluations 

        are sent for a third opinion for tie-breaking purposes. Manuscripts that 

        are accepted, or accepted with indications for reformulation, may return 

        to the authors for approval of eventual changes in the publishing process. 

        In conformity with our publishing policy, we ask proofreaders to offer 

        detailed comments on the paper being evaluated, and whenever possible, 

        to suggest specific changes and bibliographical references to the authors 

        so they can improve their papers. In this sense, the intention of the 

        evaluation process is not to restrain the authors, but rather to stimulate 

        the production of increasingly more in-depth research and reflections 

        in the area. </p>

      <p><b>Sections:</b> Submissions can be made to RBCE at any time, in a continuous 

        demand system, and the papers must be addressed to one of our three sections:<b> 

        Original Articles </b>(papers from original empirical and/or theoretical 

        research on relevant and unprecedented themes, preferably presenting the 

        following fundamental sections &#150; or variations thereof, in accordance 

        with exposure of the object and results of the investigation: <i>introduction; 

        material and methods; results and discussion; references; conclusions;</i> 

        <b>Review Articles</b> (articles whose objective is to summarize and/or 

        evaluate already published scientific papers, establishing temporal, thematic, 

        disciplinary and/or geographic cutout for analyzing consulted literature) 

        and <b>Reviews</b> (reviews of recently released books).</p>

      <p>With the intent of strengthening and expanding the frontiers of research

        author died more than 71 years ago are now public domain and thus do not 

        need authorization.</p>

      <p><b>Ethics Committee:</b> Ethical research criteria must be respected 

        as per the terms of Resolution 196/96 and 251/97 of the <i>Conselho Nacional 

        de Sa&uacute;de</i> (available at: <a

  href="http://conselho.saude.gov.br/comissao/conep/resolucao.html" target="_blank">http://conselho.saude.gov.br/comissao/conep/resolucao.html</a>),

      <p><b>Conflicts of Interest:<strong> </strong></b>Manuscript author(s) must 

        declare the existence or not of any conflicts of interest. Even when considering 

        there is no conflict of interest, the author(s) shall declare such when 

        submitting the paper, in Step 2: <i>Submission Metadata</i>, in the field 

        <b>Conflicts of interest and in the first page of the manuscript as a 

        footnote.</b> Conflicts of interest can be of a personal, commercial, 

        political, academic or financial nature, such as: be a consulting member 

        of an institution that finances the research; participate in norm committees 

        of scientific studies sponsored by industry; receive financial support 

        from institutions in which the research is carried out; conflicts present 

        within the scope of university-company cooperation; identification and 

        contact with ad hoc consultants during the evaluation process, etc. When 

        the authors submit a manuscript, they are responsible for recognizing 

        and revealing financial conflicts of another nature that may have influenced 

        their work. The authors shall recognize all financial support for the 

        study in the manuscript, and other financial or personal connections related 

        to the research (see <i>Financial support</i>, above on this page). If 

        there are no conflicts of interest, simply transcribe and add the following 

        note to the field above and to the manuscript: <i>There were no conflicts 

        of interest in conducting this study.</i> In those papers in which conflicts 

        of interest have been declared, this information shall be kept in the 

        publication as a footnote.</p>

      <p><b>Recommendations:</b> We recommend compliance with ABNT norms that 

        refer to the presentation of articles in journal publications (NBR 6023/2003), 

        presentation of quotes in documents (NBR 10.520/2002), presentation of 

        originals (NBR 12256), norm for dating (NBR 5892), progressive numbering 

        of document sections (6024/2003) and abstracts (NBR 6028/2003), and IBGE's 

        norm for tabular presentation.</p>

      <p><b>General guidelines on quotes:</b></p>

      <p>Direct quotes with less than three lines are inserted in the body of 

        the text, between quotes, with the reference as shown above.</p>

      <p>Direct quotes with more than three lines shall be highlighted, separated 

        from the body of text, indented from the left margin, with a smaller body 

        (font size) and spacing (between lines) and without quotes, with the first 

        letter capitalized, and at the end, followed by the reference as shown 

        below.</p>

      <p>Quotes reproducing speech or dialogue shall be highlighted, separated 

        from the body of text, indented from the left margin, with a smaller body 

        (font size) and spacing (between lines) and without quotes, with the first 

        letter capitalized.</p>

      <p>When in a quote between quotation marks there is a section also between 

        quotation marks, the latter shall be replaced by simple quotation marks 

        ('').</p>

      <p>Indications of direct and indirect authorship included in the text shall 

        be made in capital and small letters, indicating the date and pages in 

        parentheses. </p>

      <p>One author: According to Fulano (Year, pg. xxx). </p>

      <p>Two Authors: According to Fulano and Sicrano (Year, pg. xxx). </p>

      <p>Three Authors: Fulano, Sicrano and Beltrano (Year, pg. xxx). </p>

      <p>More than three authors: &nbsp; Fulano et al. (Year, pg. xxx). </p>

      <p>Indications of authorship of direct and indirect quotes (in parentheses) 

        shall be in capital letters, followed by the date and pages. </p>

      <p>One author: (FULANO, Year, pg. xxx). </p>

      <p>Two Authors: (FULANO; SICRANO, Year, pg. xxx). </p>

      <p>Three Authors: (FULANO; SICRANO; BELTRANO, Year, pg. xxx).</p>

      <p>More than three authors: &nbsp; (FULANO et al., Year, pg. xxx).</p>

      <p><b>Information about the evaluation process:</b> Manuscripts that comply 

        with author instructions shall be submitted to the Editorial Council or 

        ad hoc consultants who will evaluate them observing the peer-review system. 

        Those that receive disagreeing evaluations will be sent to a third proofreader 

        for tie breaking purposes. Manuscripts that are accepted, or accepted 

        with indications for reformulation, may return to the authors for approval 

        of eventual changes in the publishing process for the number for which 

        it was submitted or for subsequent numbers. Rejected manuscripts will 

        not be returned unless so requested by the respective authors within six 

        months after the submission date.</p>

      <p><b>Other information:</b> if your paper has images (figures, charts, 

        tables, photos, etc.) or any other reproduction that it is not your property, 

        send a Declaration that authorizes use of each image or document as a 

        <i>supplementary document</i> (in writing and notarized) and in which 

        the material to be reproduced in your paper is declared (enter the title 

        of the paper in the referred to declaration) is released for such a purpose. 

        Any payment that needs to be made to obtain authorization shall be made 

        by the Author(s). if the original contains photos, the Declaration of 

        authorization must be provided by the photographer and by the people photographed. 

        In the case of photographs of children and youths, the Declaration must 

        be signed by the parents or legal representatives. In some situations, 

        there is a need to ask for authorization from heirs or those who own copyrights. 

        The same holds true for Lyrics and Poems, because even short quotes demand 

        authorization from the Author or the owners of the copyrights. Epigraphs 

        follow the same rule. A quote from fiction always needs authorization, 

        as does a text and/or image protected by legislation and obtained from 

        web sites.</p>

      <p><b>Items to Verify for Submission</b></p>
