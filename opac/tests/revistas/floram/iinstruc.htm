  <td width="15%"></td>
  <td width="70%"><p>Only those  articles that fit into the following Forestry Science thematic areas are accepted for publication in Floresta e Ambiente:  Forestry, Forest Management,  Forest Products Science and Technology, Forest Biomass and Energy and  Conservation of Nature.<br>
    <br>
Floresta e Ambiente maintains high ethical standards on publications and  strict criteria for published articles. The journal selects independent and ethical reviewers who are qualified and  able to conduct an  impartial review, always seeking constructive and professional criticism.</p>
    <p><strong>Bindings</strong></p>
    <p>The submission  of an article in FLORAM implies that it has not been previously published; is  not under evaluation for publication in any other journal; its publication was  approved by all the authors and institution where it was made. The publisher  will not be legally responsible for the content of the same.<br>
      <br>
      Authors of  articles derived from academic theses should, at the time of submission, attach  a letter to the Editor providing this information (See item &quot;Upload and  File Designation&quot;). Failure to comply with this requirement could lead to  the detection of plagiarism in the manuscript and, consequently, its rejection. </p>
    <p><strong>Authorship</strong></p>
    <p>After  submission, the inclusion or removal of authors is prohibited. If necessary,  the evaluation of the article will be canceled and a new submission will be  required.<br>
      <br>
      After  submission, a change of authors' order will only be accepted if: 1) the  corresponding author sends an e-mail to floramjournal@gmail.com, with a copy to  all other authors, requesting the alteration; 2) all other authors send an  email to floramjournal@gmail.com informing that they are aware and in  accordance with the requested change; and 3) all emails sent must use the  address submitted at the time of submission. </p>
    <p><strong>Peer  Review</strong></p>
    <p>FLORAM works in  a double-blind review process. All submitted articles are initially evaluated  by the Chief Editor and / or Associate Editors regarding merit and scientific  contribution. Then the manuscripts are sent to specialized reviewers. The  Associate Editor makes a recommendation on the article and sends it to the  Editor-in-Chief, who makes the final decision based on the recommendations  made.<br>
      <br>
      In order to  preserve the double-blind system, the documents and information presented by  the authors at the time of submission should not contain information that  allows their identification, such as names, signatures or information that the  article is the product of a dissertation or thesis. Information about the institution  where the research was conducted, year and the form of linkage of the author  with the institution should also be avoided. If authors are required to use  this information to provide clarification to the Editors, they should do so at  the time of submission in a document designated as &quot;File NOT for  review&quot; (See &quot;Upload and File Designation&quot;).<br>
      <br>
      At the time of  submission, it is mandatory to indicate at least three potential reviewers for  the article. The reviewers listed may be invited to review the article at  Editor's discretion. Professionals close to one of the authors or members of  the same institution or who in any way may have some conflict of interest about  the work should not be indicated. Authors should prioritize the appointment of  highly qualified professionals and experts in the manuscript area. </p>
    <p><strong>Conflict  of Interest and Copyright</strong></p>
    <p>If there is any  conflict of interest, authors should indicate which one or which, during the  submission process. At the same time, the authors must transfer the copyrights  of the work to the FLORAM. </p>
    <p><strong>Researches  Involving Human Beings</strong></p>
    <p>All research  involving human beings, individually or collectively, in whole or in part,  directly or indirectly, including the handling of biological data, information  or materials, shall comply with all applicable regulatory guidelines and  standards required by the country of research. The research should inform that  there was consent of the participant, that is, the participants were clarified  about the nature of the research, its objectives, methods, expected benefits,  potential risks and the annoyance that this might entail to them, as far as  they are understood and respected in their singularities. If applicable, it is  recommended that the Ethics Committee of the responsible educational  institution be consulted. </p></td>

  <td width="70%"><p><strong>Submission  of Manuscripts</strong></p>
    <p>Submission of the articles should be done exclusively through the  submission system (ScholarOne), available at www.floram.org or  www.scielo.br/floram or directly through the link <a href="https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/floram-scielo">https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/floram-scielo</a>.<br>
      After the &quot;login&quot; in the ScholarOne system, the authors must  access the &quot;Author&quot; tab. The submission system will guide the author,  step by step, during all stages of submission. The submitting author must  necessarily have an Orcid ID properly linked to his ScholarOne account. For  more details, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OhpqheG9ZYcKtOeqPAmPse0erUp0v-lQbNBkEHJURxs/edit?usp=sharing">click here</a>. <br>
      After the submission is completed, the manuscript will receive an  identifier number (ID) (eg FLORAM-2018-0001). For submitting revised articles,  the ID will provide additional information about the evaluation phase the  article is in (eg FLORAM-2018-0001.R1). It is essential that the authors inform  the ID of the manuscripts in the contacts and consultations with FLORAM. <br>
      <br>
      During submission, the information entered will be saved even if the  submission has not been completed. Manuscripts whose submissions have been  initiated, but not completed, present the word &ldquo;draft&rdquo; in their ID. This  indicates that the manuscript is in draft format and has not yet been submitted  for evaluation. </p>
    <p><strong>Upload and File  Designation</strong></p>
    <p>During the submission, the authors should upload the files that are  necessary for the evaluation of the work. All uploaded files should receive the  correct designation.<br>
      <br>
      The manuscript, already containing all the figures and tables, should be  designated as &quot;Main Document&quot;. This must be sent in a single file. <br>
      Authors may submit supplementary files for the consideration of Editors  and Reviewers, such as the database used in the paper. These files should be  designated as &quot;Supplemental files for review&quot;. All files designated  in this way must be free from any information that could compromise the double  blind system.<br>
      <br>
      Supplemental files intended exclusively for Publishers should be  designated as &quot;Supplemental files not for review&quot;. Here, they  include: the declaration of revision / translation (see item Language); the  letter informing the relationship of the manuscript with academic thesis (see  section Binding) and any and all information relevant to the evaluation of the  manuscript that has compromising content to the double-blind system. </p>
    <p><strong>Evaluation of  submission rules</strong></p>
    <p>All submitted articles are initially evaluated by the Editorial  Secretary regarding compliance with our standards. If an article is disapproved  in this evaluation, it will be returned to the authors, being in draft format  (See item &quot;Submission of Manuscripts&quot;). The corresponding author will  receive an e-mail informing the occurrence, along with the list of verified  nonconformities. The author should access the system, adjust the manuscript,  and again complete the submission.<br>
      Upon the third disapproval in the evaluation of standards, the  manuscript will be rejected. Under these conditions, authors may initiate a new  submission, generating a new ID. </p>
    <p><strong>Transparency  and Tracking of the Status of the Manuscript </strong></p>
    <p>The evaluation of manuscripts involves several phases. Authors can  follow the status of manuscripts directly through the ScholarOne system, in the  &quot;Author&quot; tab, in &quot;Submitted Manuscripts&quot;. The different  status of the manuscripts, following the order of the evaluation process, are:<br>
      <br>
      Awaiting Admin Processing: indicates that the article waits for the  evaluation of rules (see item &quot;Evaluation of Submission Rules&quot;) by  the Editorial Secretary. <br>
      Awaiting AE Assignment: The article was approved in the previous step  and awaits the appointment of an Associate Editor (AE) by the Chief Editor. <br>
      Awaiting Reviewer Selection: The article has already been forwarded to  the Associate Editor and awaits the choice of reviewers for it. <br>
      <br>
      Awaiting Reviewer Invitation: At this stage, the Associate Editor should  invite reviewers to evaluate the article, from those chosen in the previous  step. <br>
      Awaiting Reviewer Assignment: Indicates that invitations have already  been sent to reviewers but that reviewers have not yet responded. If there is a  refusal on the invitations, the evaluation may return to the Awaiting Reviewer  Selection step. <br>
      <br>
      Awaiting Reviewer Scores: Indicates that reviewers who have accepted the  invitations have not yet submitted their recommendations. <br>
      <br>
      Awaiting AE Recommendation: The article received the amount of review  desired by the Associate Editor. In order to proceed with the evaluation, the  Associate Editor should make his recommendation and send the article to the  Editor in Chief. <br>
      <br>
      Awaiting EIC Decision: implies that the final decision of the Chief  Editor has not yet been issued. This status is shown for all articles that have  not yet received the final decision, regardless of the evaluation phase. </p>
    <p><strong>Publication of  Manuscripts </strong></p>
    <p>In the act of accepting the article, the corresponding author will  receive an informative email. The accepted paper will be published in the  Electronic version (ISSN: 2179-8087). <br>
      <br>
      All accepted papers will only be sent for publication after all involved  authors have associated their respective Orcids IDs to their accounts in the  ScholarOne system. It is recommended that the association of the Orcid ID be  done by the user through the ScholarOne system. For more details, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OhpqheG9ZYcKtOeqPAmPse0erUp0v-lQbNBkEHJURxs/edit?usp=sharing">click here</a>. </p>
    <p><strong>Accepted  Manuscripts Processing Fee</strong></p>
    <p>FLORAM is an Open Access Journal and all articles submitted are  evaluated at no cost. In order for the accepted article to be published,  authors must contract the publishing services directly with the accredited  company (s) that perform the review, layout and publication of the article  according to the editorial standard adopted by FLORAM and accepted by its  indexers. The details will be informed along with the letter of acceptance of  the article. Payment should only be made directly to the company providing the  services. FLORAM does not collect fees. The publication fee is R$  700.00 (seven hundred reais) for national authors and US $ 200.00 (two hundred  US dollars) for foreign authors.</p></td>
