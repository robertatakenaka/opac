        of the research, teaching and assistance in surgical, clinical, and endoscopic 

        gastroenterology, and related areas. Its main sections are original articles,

        exclusively to the ABCD and report on original work; they cannot have 

         been   published previously in a similar format. Every subject matter 

        involving human or animal research must have the previous approval of 

        the Research Ethics Committee of the institution where the research was 

        conducted or  another  local or regional institution if there is no such 

        committee at the institution where it was conducted. In compliance with 

        current guidelines for good practice in human research, the patients enrolled 

        in the study must sign an  informed consent form. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The ABCD supports the policies for the 

        registration of clinical trials of the World Health Organization (WHO) 

        and the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), as 

        it acknowledges the importance of such initiatives to the registration 

        and international dissemination of information in publicly accessible 

        clinical studies. As of 2007, articles reporting on randomized controlled 

        trials and clinical trials will only be accepted for publication if they 

        have been assigned an identification number in one of the Clinical Trials 

        Registries  validated by the criteria put forth by the WHO and ICMJE and 

        whose URLs are available from the ICMJE website (<a href="http://www.icmje.org" target="_blank">www.icmje.org</a>). 

        The identification number should be included at the end of the abstract.      

        </font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The manuscripts, in Portuguese or English, 

        should be submitted in electronic form by email to <u><a href="mailto:revistaabcd@gmail.com" target="_blank">revistaabcd@gmail.com</a></u> (phone +55 0 xx 41 3240-5488). The author(s) will receive an email to 

        acknowledge receipt of the manuscript and to notify that it was forwarded 

        to editorial analysis. This confirmation is no guarantee of the publication 

        of the manuscript. The writing of the manuscripts must conform to the 

        format chosen by the author among the ABCD sections, which are detailed 

        further on.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The manuscripts must be typewritten in 

        12-point Arial font, single-spaced throughout. The pages should be numbered 

        consecutively beginning on the title page. The maximum length of the manuscript, 

        including references, tables and figures, must not exceed 15 pages for 

        original and review articles, five pages for case reports and editorials, 

        and two pages for letters to the Editor (these should not contain tables 

        and figures). Tables and figures should be placed immediately following 

        their mention in the text, not at the end of the manuscript. The authors 

        or advertisers are fully responsible for all concepts and  scientific 

        assertions expressed in the articles or printed advertisements. In order 

        to standardize the usage of medical terminology, the authors should use 

        the Terminologia Anatomica, São Paulo, Editora Manole, 1ªEd., 2001 for 

        the anatomical terms. It is the ABCD's prerogative to do so if the author(s)

        7) an abstract in English, containing the same headings and scientific 

        data and in the same style as the Portuguese version, structured as follows:

        or figures. Results must be both presented in the tables and described 

        in the text. Tables, graphs, charts and figures should also be self-explanatory, 

        i.e., if  readers wish to proceed with the reading of the article only 

        by following them, in the end they should be able to interpret the results 

        in the same way as they would if they had read only the text. </font></p>

        or in the body of the text –, and should be placed immediately following 

        their mention in the text and not at the end of the paper. Special care 

        should be taken to avoid duplication, e.g., a graph showing the same information 

        as a table. In that case, the reviewer of the article will suggest to 

        the Editor the exclusion of whichever is found redundant.</font></p>

        to verify the relevance of the medical contribution of the article, its 

        originality, the validity of the methods employed, the validity of the 

        results, and the formal aspect of the writing. Anonymity is ensured throughout 

        the review process. The rejected manuscripts will be returned. The approved 

        manuscripts and those accepted under certain conditions may be returned 

        to the authors for approval of occasional major alterations made in the
