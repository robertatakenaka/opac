      <p>The submitted works should be original (unpublished version) and must 
        be exclusively intended for <b>REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE COLOPROCTOLOGIA</b>. 
        The revision articles will be inserted under the proposal of the Editorial 
        Board. In special cases, re-publication of the national or foreign works 
        must contain formal authorization of the author and of the Journal / Copyright 
        Holder. </p>
      <p>The norms are based on the format proposed by the International Committee 
        of Medical Journal Editors and published in the article: Uniform requirements 
        for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals, which was updated in 
        October 2004 and is available on the Website: <a href="http://www.icmje.org" target="_blank">http://www.icmje.org</a>. 
        For randomized clinical trials, the work should be presented in conformity 
        with the CONSORT guidelines (Begg C, Cho N, Eastwood S et al. Improving 
        the quality of reporting of randomized clinical trials: the CONSORT statement. 
        JAMA 1996;276:637-9). A verification list is available on the JAMA Website:

        &quot;instructions to authors&quot; and are in accordance with its publishing 
        policy, are sent to 4 members of the editorial board, who will consider 
        the scientific merit of such contribution. The manuscripts are then sent 
        to the referees previously selected at random by the Editors. Anonymity

        the exchange system among them. Refused manuscripts - Not accepted manuscripts 
        will not be returned, unless they are requested by the proper authors.

        as a new work, starting a new judgment process. Accepted manuscripts - 
        Accepted manuscripts or accepted under condition may be returned to the 
        authors for approval of eventual alterations during the editing and normalization 
        process according to the style used by the Journal. Approval for Publication

        Editor-in-Chief justification. Comments of the advisers, in such cases, 
        may be sent by the Editor-in-Chief or requested by the Author. Final Correction: 
        A proof of the articles to be published will be sent to the author for 
        possible corrections and should be sent back as soon as possible. If a 
        delay may occur when returning the revised articles, the Editor-in-Chief 
        reserves the right to publish, irrespective of the final correction. A
