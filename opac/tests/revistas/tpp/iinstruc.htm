    <p>The aim of&nbsp;<b>Tropical Plant Pathology,&nbsp;</b>an  international, bimonthly journal of the<b>&nbsp;</b>Brazilian Phytopathological  Society, is to publish results of research on fundamental  and applied aspects of plant pathology. Contributions in the fields of  mycology, bacteriology, virology, nematology, epidemiology, host-pathogen  interactions, genetics of plant pathogens, physiological and molecular plant  pathology, post&ndash;harvest and non-infectious diseases and about other topics or  strategies promoting plant protection are welcome. Manuscripts on screening for  synthetic or natural products and for resistance to pathogens can be accepted  as research article only if they provide additional information on modes of  action or mechanisms of resistance. TPP will not publish manuscripts based only  on evaluation of plant protection products. Surveys for diseases or pathogens  and first reports of plant diseases should be submitted as a &ldquo;Short  Communication&rdquo; and will be published only if of special relevance (major  host-crop, major quarantine relevance). In the case of first records for  Brazil, authors must follow the official rules requiring prior communication  of the occurrence to the authorities in the Ministry of Agriculture &ndash; MAPA and  provide evidence of such. New regional records of previously known diseases for  a country are generally not acceptable for publication in TPP, but special  cases can be considered. Manuscripts should report results originated from  experiments that were repeated in time in order to assure the consistency of  the findings, unless the research results are of non-quantitave nature. This should  be particularly observed for field experiments.</td>

      <p><b>Tropical Plant Pathology&nbsp;</b>is an official  publication of the Brazilian Phytopathological Society, but contributions from  members and non-members of the Society are equally welcome. It is a fundamental  condition that submitted manuscripts have not been and will not be published  elsewhere. With the acceptance of a manuscript for publication, the publishers acquire  full and exclusive copyright for all languages and countries. There are no page  charges. Reprints can be obtained free of charge as&nbsp; pdf-files from TPP&rsquo;s  website at the SciELO gateway. </p>

      <p><b>Manuscripts should be written in  English</b> <br>
    Manuscripts will initially be checked by the Editors for  conformity with the scope of the journal, and will then be assigned to a  Section Editor. The Section Editor will oversee the review process and will be  responsible for the final decision. Acceptance is based on the quality of the  work, on the recognition of a significant contribution to the field and on the overall presentation of the manuscript.</p></td>

      <p>Manuscripts  are submitted to TPP through the ScholarOne Online system, free of charge (<a href="http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/tpp-scielo" target="_blank"><i>http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/tpp-scielo</i></a>).&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>Before  submitting a manuscript, authors must have carefully prepared the following  items:</b><br>
        a) A  cover letter, which clearly states that (i) all authors have approved the  submission of the manuscript; (ii) the findings have not been published or are  not under consideration for publication elsewhere; (iii) authors transfer  copyright to the Brazilian Phytopathological Society. A corresponding author  must be clearly indicated and will be responsible for all correspondence  between the Editorial Board and the authors;<br>
        b) A  file including the main text, tables and figure legends, prepared in Word (.doc  or .docx) or RTF (.rtf);<br>
        c) Individual files containing one Figure each, prepared as TIFF or JPEG  files at high resolution (at least 300 dpi). </p>
      <p>Failure  to adhere to these guidelines will lead to the immediate rejection of&nbsp; manuscripts. <br>
        The  Editorial Board expects authors to ensure  that the language is corrected before submission. Language correction will not  be performed by the Editors or the Section Editor, and manuscripts will be  returned to the authors if the language requires correction. </p>
      <p><b>Types  of papers</b></p>
      <p><b>1  Research Article</b></p>
      <p>Manuscripts  should be prepared in double-spaced, 12-point type throughout, including the  References section, appendices, tables, and figure captions. Page configuration  should be A4 with 2.5 cm margins and marked with consecutive page and line  numbers, beginning with the cover page.</p>
      <p>The  following elements must start on a new page and be ordered as they are listed  below:</p>
      <p>        a)&nbsp;The <b>title page</b>&nbsp;must contain: a  concise and informative title; the authors&rsquo; names (first and last name in  full); the authors&rsquo; institutional affiliation or where the research has been  performed, including department, institution, zip code, city, state or province  and country (note that affiliation should be that where the author was  connected when the work was performed &ndash; in case the author has moved to a  different working address this may be indicated separately as &ldquo;present  address&rdquo;); different affiliations are indicated with superscript numbers; the  corresponding author&rsquo;s name with e-mail address. The corresponding author is  the person responsible for checking the page proofs, arranging for the  payment of color illustrations and any other duties related to the processing  of the manuscript.</p>
      <p> b)&nbsp;The <b>Abstract</b>&nbsp;must be a single paragraph that does not exceed 200 words and  summarizes the main results and conclusions of the study. It should not contain  references. </p>
      <p> c) <b>Key words</b>: up to six key words should be included, and these  should differ from words mentioned in the title. These should start with the  scientific names of hosts and pathogens involved in the study (or the most  relevant ones) in alphabetical order and be followed by the other key words,  also in alphabetical order.</p>
      <p> d)&nbsp;The <b>text</b>&nbsp;must be as succinct as possible and  includes the following elements:</p>
      <p><b><i>Introduction:</i></b> Description of the background that led to the study and the hypothesis which is  being tested, in case this applies.</p>
      <p><b><i>Material  and Methods:</i></b> Detailed  description of the steps followed by the authors allowing the reader to repeat  the work if willing to do so.&nbsp; Avoid,  whenever possible, to simply refer to another publication for a complete  description of methodology. Statistical methods should be explained at the end  of this section.</p>
      <p><b><i>Results:</i></b> Undue repetition in text and tables should be avoided.  Comment on significance of results is appropriate but broader discussion should  be part of the Discussion section.</p>
      <p><b><i>Discussion:</i></b><i>&nbsp;</i>The findings of the study should  be placed in the context of relevant published data. Ideas presented in other  publications should not be included solely to increase the size of the  manuscript. Some manuscripts may require different formats in order to better  fit their content. This will be evaluated on a case by case basis. </p>
      <p><b><i>Text  citation</i></b><b>s:</b> articles should be referred to by authors&rsquo; surnames  and date of publication; citations with two authors must include both names; in  citations with three or more authors, name the first author and use et al<i>.</i>&nbsp;List  two or more references in the same citation in chronological order, separated  by semi-colons. When two or more works in a citation were published in the same  year, list them alphabetically by the first author surname. For two or more  works by the same author(s) in a citation, list them chronologically, with the  years separated by commas. (Example: Barreto et al., 2006a, 2006b, 2008). Only  articles that are published or in press should be cited. In the case of  &ldquo;Personal communication&rdquo; or &ldquo;Unpublished results&rdquo;, all contributors must be  listed by initials and last name (et al<i>.</i>&nbsp;should not be used).&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b><i>Number</i></b><b>s:</b> In the  text, numbers nine or below must be written  out except as part of a date, a fraction or decimal, a percentage, or a unit of  measurement. Use Arabic numerals for numbers larger than nine. Avoid starting a  sentence with a number, but if doing so write the number out. URLs for  programs, data or other sources should be listed in the text, or as a footnote.  URLs for citations of publications in electronic journals should appear in the  References section.<br>
        e)&nbsp;<b><i>Acknowledegments</i></b>&nbsp;must be a single paragraph that immediately follows the Discussion section and includes  references to grant support or any technical or intellectual  contribution.</p>
      <p>f)&nbsp;<b><i>References</i></b> must be ordered alphabetically by the first author surname. References with the  same first author should be ordered as follows: first, as single author in  chronological order; second, with only one co-author in alphabetical order by  the second author; and third, references with more than two co-authors, in  alphabetical order by the second or subsequent authors. Journal titles should  not be abbreviated. <br>
        Authors  should avoid citation of theses, conference proceedings or technical reports,  mainly for reasons of accessibility. A maximum of three such citations will be  allowed. <br>
        Only  articles that are published or in press should be included in this section.  Manuscripts submitted for publication but not yet accepted may not be cited.  Personal communications and unpublished data must be cited within the text.  &ldquo;Personal communication&rdquo; refers to individuals other than the authors of the  manuscript being submitted; &ldquo;unpublished data&rdquo; refers to data produced by at  least one of the authors of the manuscript being submitted. Authors must  provide appropriate evidence for &ldquo;in press&rdquo; articles and &ldquo;personal  communications&rdquo;.</p>

      <p>g)&nbsp;<b>Tables:</b>&nbsp;Place  tables after the References section. Each table must start on a new page. A  concise title should be provided above the table. Tables must be numbered  consecutively in Arabic numerals. Each column must have a title in the box  head. Footnotes typed directly below the table should be indicated preferably  in lowercase superscript numbers, but lowercase letters may be used when the  column titles contain numbers. </p>
      <p>h)&nbsp;<b>Figures</b>&nbsp;must  be numbered consecutively in Arabic numerals  and should be sized to fit approximately within the columns of the journal.  Legends should be in the main text, after the tables. Please insert keys and  scale bars, when applicable, directly in the figure. Scanned figures should not  be submitted. Images should be in TIFF or JPEG format and provided as separate  files. Figures in Word format cannot be published. Journal quality reproduction  will require grayscale and color at resolution yielding 300 dpi. Authors should  submit bitmapped line art at resolution yielding 600-1200 dpi. These  resolutions refer to the output size of the file; if it is anticipated that  images will be enlarged or reduced, the resolutions should be adjusted  accordingly. Special care must be taken with the quality of the images.  The commonly used procedure of taking pictures with a digital camerea placed  above a microscope eyepiece normally yields poor quality images with shaded  periphery that are inadequate for publication. It is highly recommended to indicate details of interest in  pictures with arrows accompanied with explanations of what has been indicated  in the legend. </p>
      <p>i)&nbsp;<b>Nomenclature</b>&nbsp;of  scientific names should adhere to current international standards for each  class of organisms. Scientific names should appear in full and followed by authority  the first time they appear in the body of the text (but not followed by  authority in the title, abstract, key words, tables or legends), and  abbreviated and without authorities later. Whenever a scientific names appear  at the beginning of a sentence it must be given in full. <br>

      <p>j)&nbsp;<b>Cultures and other reference material:</b> Source and deposit  of cultures should be indicated. Voucher cultures and specimens documenting  their research as well as nucleotide sequences should be deposited at certified  or recognized international institutions and accession numbers and place of  deposit indicated in the text or as a footnote in the title page.</p>
      <p>k)&nbsp;<b>Data access:</b>&nbsp;Reference should be made to  availability of detailed data and materials used for reported studies.</p>
      <p>l)&nbsp;<b>Abbreviations and Units:</b>&nbsp;SI units should be used,  such as mg, g, m, mm, L, mL, &mu;L, h, min, s, mol, kg/ha. If a  non-standard abbreviation is to be used, it should be defined in full when  cited in the text for the first time.</p>
      <p>m)&nbsp;<b>Crop  Protection Products:&nbsp;</b>Only technical names or names of active compounds  should be used. It is not recommended that authors mention commercial names of  products or of the companies which produce them, so as not to suggest  utilization. Chemical formulas should be written on one line and follow  standard nomenclature. </p>
      <p><b>2 Short Communication</b></p>
      <p>Present brief observations or results that do not warrant full-length  articles. Preliminary  communications of ongoing work are not acceptable as short communications.  Individual first reports of plant diseases should be submitted as Short Communications. These  manuscripts may include illustrations of the pathogen, indication of deposit of  reference material with public access, including DNA sequences (whenever  available or in cases where they are indispensable), and documentation as  required by specific legislation, such as, in the case of records from Brazil,  abiding to the rules established by the Ministry of Agriculture. <br>
        Short Communications should be 12 or fewer typed pages in A4-size, 2,5 cm margins, double-spaced  12-point type, including references but not tables and figure legends. They  should include an Abstract, not longer than 200 words and no further  subdivision. All its content should be in a single section with no subtitles  such as introduction, material and methods, results and discussion. Up to two  tables and two figures, or any combination of four such items, may be submitted  in a Short Communication. The title page and reference section format is that  of a full-length article.</p>
      <p><b>3 Letter to the Editor</b></p>
      <p>This may relate or respond to recent  published items of interest to the area of Plant Pathology. Discussions of  political, social and ethical issues of interest to plant pathologists are also  welcome in this format. Letters to the Editor should be no longer than two  typed pages in A4-size, 2,5 cm margins, double-spaced 12-point type, including  references (if applicable). They should not include an Abstract or any  subdivision of the text. If absolutely necessary, they may include one figure  or table. </p>
      <p><b>4 Review Article</b></p>
      <p>Review Articles are welcome. Authors should  contact the Editor before submission. Review Articles are subjected to peer  review in the same fashion as regular research articles. Reviews should have no  more than 40 typed pages in A4-size, 2,5 cm margins, double-spaced 12-point  type, including references, tables and figures. The title page and reference  format is that of a full-length article. They should include an Abstract, not  longer than 200 words. The text may be subdivided according to the authors&rsquo;  discretion. </p>
      <p><b>Proofs</b></p>
      <p>Page proofs will be sent to the  corresponding author. Notes added in proof require Editorial approval. Proofs  should be returned within 72 hours.</p>
      <p><b>Reprints</b></p>
      <p>Reprints are free of charge and will  become available as a pdf-file at TPP&rsquo;s web site in the SciELO gateway.</p>
      <p><b>Authorship</b></p>
      <p>Those who submit papers to&nbsp;<b>Tropical  Plant Pathology</b>&nbsp;should respect the value of the research of their  peers by not devaluing authorship. Each author should have made a substantial  intellectual contribution to the design, conduct, analysis, or interpretation  of the study. Each author must approve the final version of the article to be  published, and be willing to take public responsibility for their contribution  to the paper. In addition, all authors are expected to take public  responsibility for the entire paper, irrespective of of their specific  contribution. TPP&rsquo;s manuscript handling system provides plagiarism detection  tools to the Editors, Section Editors and Reviewers. Detection of plagiarism is  grounds for immediate rejection of manuscripts. </p>
    <p><b>These instructions are also available at  TPP&rsquo;s web sites at the SBF&nbsp;(<i><a href="http://www.sbfito.com.br/tpp" target="_blank">http://www.sbfito.com.br/tpp</a></i>)&nbsp;and  SciELO&nbsp;</b><b>(</b><i><a href="http://www.scielo.br/revistas/tpp/pinstruc.htm" target="_blank">http://www.scielo.br/revistas/tpp/pinstruc.htm</a></i><b>) gateways.</b> </p></td>
