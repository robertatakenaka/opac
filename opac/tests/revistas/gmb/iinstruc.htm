   <p><strong>Genetics and Molecular Biology </strong>(formerly named Revista Brasileira de Genética/Brazilian Journal of Genetics - ISSN 0100-8455) is published by the Sociedade Brasileira de Genética (Brazilian Society of Genetics).</p>
   <p> The journal considers contributions that present the results of original research in genetics, molecular biology, evolution and related scientific disciplines. Manuscripts presenting methods and applications only, without an analysis of genetic data, will not be considered.</p>
   <p>It is a fundamental condition that submitted manuscripts have not been published or are not under consideration for publication elsewhere. With the acceptance of a manuscript for publication, the publishers acquire full and exclusive copyright for all languages and countries.</p>
   <p> Manuscripts considered in conformity with the scope of the journal, as evaluated by the Editor, are reviewed by an Associate Editors and two or more external reviewers. Acceptance by the Editor is based on the quality of the work as substantial contribution to the field and on the overall presentation of the manuscript.</p>
   <p>The official abbreviation for Genetics and Molecular Biology is <strong>Genet. Mol. Biol.</strong></p>
   <p><strong>Open-Access policy </strong><br>

   <p align="left"><a href="https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/gmb-scielo" target="_blank">https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/gmb-scielo</a></p>
A cover letter addressed to the Editor-in-Chief is required
<p><strong>2. For submission the following instructions must be observed:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>a) </strong>The manuscript must be submitted by the Corresponding Author, identified as such in the title page of the manuscript. This is the person who will also check the page proofs, and arranges for any payment that may incur during the editorial process. The submitting author must provide an ORCID ID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID, <a href="http://orcid.org/">http://orcid.org/</a>) at the time of submission by entering it in the user profile in the submission system.</p>
  <p><strong>b)</strong> Entering the following metadata is required: (i) the manuscript title, (ii) a short running title (max. 35 characters), (iii) the Abstract, and (iv) up to five keywords. All these items must be exactly the same as those figuring in the first two pages of the manuscript file.</p>
  <p><strong>c)</strong> Statements are required informing that the data have not been published and are not under consideration elsewhere, and that all authors have approved the submission of the manuscript. Furthermore, possible conflicts of interest (e.g. due to funding, consultancies) must also be disclosed. For statements on ethical issues in research see below (3.1.m).</p>
  <p><strong>d)</strong> The names of all co-authors, including institutional affiliations and e-mail addresses must be entered, as contact information for the Editorial Office. We strongly encourage co-authors to also provide their ORCID iDs at the time of submission.</p>
  <p><strong>e)</strong> In the referee suggestions field, up to five reviewer names can be entered by the author(s); valid e-mail contact addresses for these are required, in case they are selected by the editor. These suggestions can be made separately as preferred and opposed reviewer(s).</p>
  <p><strong>f)</strong> Files must be uploaded separately and identified according to file types, respecting the following sequence: main text document (title page as page 1), tables, figures and, if applicable, supplementary material. The main text file must include the title page, Abstract, References and, if applicable, figure legends, which must be typed on a separate page following the References and Internet Resources sections. Each table, figure and element containing supplementary material must be saved and uploaded in a separate file. Formats for text and tables are Word or RTF in Windows platform. Figures should be in TIFF or JPEG formats (see detailed instructions in 3.1.i).</p>
  <p><strong>g)</strong> Manuscripts including photos or any other identifiable data of human subjects must be accompanied by a copy of the signed consent by the individual or his/her guardian.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Failure to adhere to these guidelines can delay the handling of your contribution and manuscripts may be returned before being reviewed.</p>
<p>Special attention should be given to the structuring of the manuscript and correct language usage. These are important factors in the smooth running of the editorial and peer-review process, and can result in faster publication.</p>
<p><strong>3. Categories of  Contribution</strong><br>
  <strong>3.1. Research Articles</strong></p>
Manuscripts must be written in English in  double-spaced, 12-point type throughout; marked with consecutive line and page  numbers, beginning with the title page.
<p>The following  elements must start on a new page and be ordered as they are listed below:</p>
<p>a) <strong>The Title Page</strong> must contain: a concise  and informative title; the authors&rsquo; names (first name at full length); the  authors&rsquo; institutional affiliation, including department, institution, city,  state or province, and country; different affiliations must be indicated with  superscript Arabic numbers; a short running title of up to 35 characters (including  spaces); up to five key words; the corresponding author&rsquo;s name, full postal,  and email address.</p>
<p>b) <strong>The Abstract</strong> must be a single paragraph  that does not exceed 200 words and summarizes the main results and conclusions  of the study. It should not contain references.</p>
<p>c) <strong>The  text</strong> must be as succinct as possible. <em>Text  citation</em>s: articles should be referred to by authors&rsquo; surnames and date of  publication; citations with two authors must include both names separated by  &ldquo;and&rdquo;; in citations with three or more authors, name the first author and use <em>et al.</em> List two or more references in  the same citation in chronological order, separated by semi-colons. When two or  more works in a citation were published in the same year, list them  alphabetically by the first author surname. For two or more works by the same  author(s) in a citation, list them chronologically, with the years separated by  commas. (Example: Freire-Maia <em>et al</em>.,  1966a, 1966b, 2000). Only articles that are published or in press should be cited.  In the case of personal communications or unpublished results, all contributors  must be listed by initials and last name (<em>et  al.</em> should not be used). <em>Number</em>s:  In the text, numbers nine or less must be written out except as part of a date,  a fraction or decimal, a percentage, or a unit of measurement. Use Arabic  numerals for numbers larger than nine. Do not start a sentence with an Arabic  numeral. <em>Binomial Name</em>s: Latin names  of genera, species and infraspecific taxa must be printed in italics; we also recommend  to present names of orders or families in the Title and/or when first mentioned  in the text. URLs for programs, data or other sources should be listed in the  Internet Resources Section, immediately following the References Section, not  in the text.</p>
<p>The text includes the  following elements:</p>
<p><em>Introduction </em>- Description of the background that led to the study.</p>
<p><em>Material (or Subjects) and Methods </em>- Details relevant to the conduct of the study.  Statistical methods should be explained at the end of this section.</p>
<p><em>Results </em>- Undue repetition in text and tables should be  avoided. Statistical analyses should be presented as complete as possible, i.e.  not only <em>P</em>-values should be shown,  but also all other test variables required for full appreciation of the results.  Comments on relevance of results are appropriate but broader discussion should  be part of the Discussion section.</p>
<p><em>Discussion - </em>The findings of the study should be placed in context  of relevant published data. Ideas presented in other publications should not be  discussed solely to make an exhaustive presentation.</p>
<p>Some manuscripts may  require different formats appropriate to their content.</p>
<p>d) <strong>The Acknowledgments</strong> must be a single  paragraph that immediately follows the discussion and includes references to grant  support.</p>
<p>e) <strong>Conflict of Interest:</strong> Any possible conflict  of interest must be disclosed here. If there is none, please state: The authors  declare that there is no conflict of interest that could be perceived as  prejudicial to the impartiality of the reported research.</p>
<p>f) <strong>The References Section:</strong> Only articles  that are published or in press should be included in this section. Works  submitted for publication but not yet accepted, personal communications and  unpublished data must be cited within the text. &ldquo;Personal communication&rdquo; refers  to information obtained from individuals other than the authors of the  manuscript being submitted; &ldquo;unpublished data&rdquo; refers to data produced by at  least one of the authors of the manuscript under consideration. Works of restricted  circulation (e.g., theses not available in public databases, congress abstracts  not published in regular journals or public databases) should not be listed in  this section.</p>
<p>References must be  ordered alphabetically by the first author surname; references with the same  first author should be ordered as follows: first, as single author in  chronological order; next, with only one more co-author in alphabetical order  by the second author; and finally followed by references with more than two  co-authors, in chronological order, independent of the second author surnames.  In references with more than 10 authors only the first ten should be listed,  followed by <em>et al</em>. Use standard  abbreviations for journal titles as suggested by NCBI (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/journals/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/journals/</a>)  or Thomson Reuters Web of Science.</p>

<p>h) <strong>Tables: Formats for tables are Word or RTF  in Windows platform. They </strong>must be prepared with the table tool (do not use  space bar or tabulator) and must be numbered consecutively in Arabic numerals).  A concise title should be provided above the table. Each column should have a  title in the box head. Footnotes typed directly below the table should be  indicated in lowercase superscript letters. Tables that are to appear in the  printed version must be saved in Word format and not as figures, so that they  can later be fitted during typesetting. Each table must be saved and uploaded  as a separate file.</p>
<p>i) <strong>Figures: Formats for figures are TIFF or  JPEG. They</strong> must be numbered consecutively using Arabic numerals. Figures in  Word, PowerPoint or Excel format cannot be published. Only sequence data can be  presented in Word format. Journal quality reproduction will require resolution  yielding 300 dpi for grayscale and color figures. These resolutions refer to  the output size of the file, that being the size in which it will appear  printed in the journal; if it is anticipated that images will be enlarged or  reduced, the resolutions should be adjusted accordingly. Figures composed of  several elements should be sent as a single panel, obeying the print size  definitions of the journal (single or two columns width). Scanned figures  should not be submitted. Color illustrations are accepted and will be  reproduced free of chrge in the electronic and printed versions. Figure legends  must be included at the end of the main text file and should be typed on a new  page. When uploading, identify each illustration by the first author name and  the number of the respective figure. Each figure/panel must be saved and  uploaded as a separate file.</p>
<p>j) <strong>Nomenclature: </strong>Taxonomic names should be  in accordance with current international standards. For rules concerning gene  names and gene symbols, please see separate Instruction form.</p>
<p>k) <strong>Sequences</strong> may appear in text or in  figure. DNA, RNA and protein sequences equal to or greater than 50 units must  be entered into public databases and accession numbers must be provided upon  acceptance of the article. Failure to do so will inadvertently delay  publication.</p>
<p>l) <strong>Data access:</strong> reference should be made  to availability of detailed data and materials used for reported studies.</p>
<p>m) <strong>Ethical issues:</strong> Reports of experiments  on live vertebrates must include a statement in the text that the institutional  review board approved the work and the protocol number must be provided. For  experiments involving human subjects, a statement must be provided that  informed consent was obtained from all subjects. If photos or any other  identifiable data are included, a copy of the signed consent must be uploaded  during manuscript submission.</p>
<p>n) <strong>Supplementary Material</strong>: Data that the  authors consider of importance for completeness of a study, but which are too  extensive to be included in the print version, can be submitted as  Supplementary Material. At publication, this material will be made available  together with the electronic version. In case a manuscript contains such  material, it should be appropriately identified within the text file.  Supplementary material in tables should be identified as Table S1, Table S2,  etc., in case of figures they should be named accordingly, Figure S1, Figure  S2. In addition, a list of this material should be presented at the end of the  manuscript text file, containing the following statement:</p>
<p><em>Supplementary material - the following online  material is available for this article:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Table S1 – &lt; short title &gt;</em></li>
  <li><em>Figure S1 – &lt; short title &gt;</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3.2 Short  Communications</strong></p>
<p>Short Communications  present brief observations that do not warrant full-length articles. They  should not be considered preliminary communications. They should be 15 or fewer  typed pages in double spaced 12-point type, including literature cited, include  an Abstract no longer than five percent of the paper’s length, but no further  subdivision, with introduction, material and methods, results and discussion in  a single section and without headers. Up to four items (tables and/or figures)  may be submitted. The title page and reference section format is that of a full-length  Research Article. For Supplementary Material see instructions in item 3.1.n</p>
<p><strong>3.3 Genome Insight</strong></p>
<p>Genome Insight&nbsp;is for focused papers,  usually of approximately 1500 words (up to four tables or figures), that  publish new genome data as they become submitted to GenBank. This  section&nbsp;is the premier forum to deliver that information directly to the  genome community in a rapid and efficient publication of the genome. Data must  be related to a complete (or nearly complete) and fully annotated genome for  prokaryote or viruses, but a draft may be accepted for an eukaryote genome.  While the focus of Genome Insight is necessarily involved in novel sequences,  the manuscript must contain specifically novel biological, evolutive,  biotechnological and/or metabolic insights revealed by data. The work may provide  comparative analyses of previously published genomes that contain a substantial  and novel insight of broadest biological and genetic significance.</p>
<p>Submitted  manuscript must contain an abstract, which should be a brief report on the  organism as well as its relevance and the main insight revealed by the genome.  The text (approximately 1500 words- excluding abstract, references and  acknowledgements) should not contain subdivisions, but must contain the  rational for the selection of such organism as well as organism information  (including taxonomy, natural habitat, phylogenetic position, eventual  pathogenicity, symbiotic, biotechnological use, etc), methodology (genome  sequencing and assembly; reference number at GenBank), genome relevance (which  should indicate the main insights revealed by the data analysis and main  conclusions. Acknowledgements and References (up to 20 references) headings  should be included. Figure Legends should be provided at the end of the  manuscript.</p>
<p>Metagenome, transcriptome as well as epigenome  data may also be considered for publication, but prior submission of the  abstract to the Editor is necessary.</p>
<p>Note: The title page,  abstract and reference section format is that of a full-length Research  Article. For Supplementary Material see item 3.1.n. in our Instructions to  Authors.</p>
<p><strong>3.4 Letters to the  Editor</strong></p>
<p>Relate or respond to  recent published items in the journal. Discussions of political, social and  ethical issues of interest to geneticists are also welcome in this form.</p>
<p><strong>3.5 Review Articles</strong></p>
<p>Review Articles are welcome. The Editor must be contacted prior to submission. Please, provide an Abstract and a list of your recent publications in the area.</p>
<p><strong>3.6 Book Reviews</strong></p>
<p>Publishers are  invited to submit books on Genetics, Evolution and related disciplines, for  review in the journal. Aspiring reviewers may propose writing a review.</p>
<p><strong>3.7 History, Story  and Memories</strong></p>
<p>These are accounts on  historical aspects of Genetics relating to Brazil.</p>
<p><strong>4. Articles accepted  for publication</strong></p>
<p>Once an article is accepted, the Editorial  Office will send it to copy editor for language and technical corrections. If  major corrections were proposed, the manuscript with the highlighted  corrections will be returned to the corresponding author for approval. The  final version approved by the authors must be free of any text/correction  markings when returned to the Editorial Office.</p>
<p>After typesetting, page proofs will be sent to  the corresponding author. Changes made to page proofs, apart from typesetting errors,  will be charged to the authors. Notes added in proof require Editorial  approval.</p>
<p>Together with the proofs, a form of consent to  publish and transfer of copyright is sent to the corresponding author, who will  have sign this form, also on behalf of any co-authors, and send it by e-mail to  the Editorial Office.</p>
<p><strong>5. Availability of  articles and deposition in databases</strong></p>
<p>Article copies are provided as PDF-files.  Authors may deposit these in their personal or institutional homepage, as well  as in public databases.</p>
<p><strong>6. Publication charge</strong></p>
<p>There is a publication charge for manuscripts  once they are accepted. For price information, exemptions and waiver policies,  please consult the journal homepage <a href="http://www.gmb.org.br/">http://www.gmb.org.br</a>.</p></td>
