      <p><strong>Research on  Biomedical Engineering</strong> (RBE)  is the official journal of the Brazilian Society of Biomedical Engineering and  is dedicated to publishing research in all fields of Biomedical Engineering. In  addition, this journal aims to provide educational material and professional  updating, as well as serving as a forum for the establishment of developing  policies and incorporation of health technologies by the public or private  sectors.       
      <p><strong>RBE</strong> is an English-language journal and publishes  original research, reviews,  technical communications and letters to the editor on current topics in all fields of Biomedical  Engineering. Prospective authors should follow the general instructions given  below. Submission of a manuscript implies that it has not been published or is  currently under consideration for publication elsewhere. Form more information  please contact the editorial office.</p>
      <p>Submitted  articles will be subjected to peer review, ensuring the excellence of the  researches published by RBE. The submitted manuscript is always considered a  confidential document. Therefore, during review, no one is allowed to share the  manuscript without the explicit permission of the Editor, who should ask for  the permission of the authors, if necessary.</p>
      <p>For an in-depth review, at least two referees  are consulted and their identity will not be disclosed. The reviewers&rsquo; comments  and recommendation will be shared only with the authors, and possibly with  other reviewers and the Editorial Board of RBE. Articles accepted for publication become the property of the journal.</p>
      <p>The Journal adopts iThenticate system for identifying plagiarism.</p>

       <p><b>Manuscript  Categories</b></p>
      <p><strong>Research on Biomedical Engineering</strong> encourages submissions of <em>Original articles, Reviews, Technical  communications and Letters to the editor</em>, written in English.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Original articles</em></strong></p>
     
      <p>These articles  describe significant methods and results of original research and developments  in the area.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Reviews</em></strong></p>
  
      <p>Review articles  should cover themes that are relevant to the area, describing the state of the  art with a critical view of recent developments and/or introducing original  points of view &ndash; they should not be limited to a simple review of the  literature. The submission of this type of article must be made upon invitation  or previous consult to the Editor-in-Chief.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Technical communication</em></strong></p>
    
      <p>Technical  communications are considered important tools for disseminating ingenious  solutions for design, maintenance, experimental techniques and applied  informatics. While not considered as a full scientific article, a technical  communication allows readers to benefit from the ingenuity and creativity of the  authors.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Letters to the editor</em></strong></p>

      <p>Those letters  normally should contain comments or discussion of previously published papers  or other topics of interest to the community. Whenever necessary, we shall give  the opportunity to authors, organizations or individuals, mentioned in the  letter, to respond. The letters are not submitted to peer review and are  published at the discretion of the Editorial Board.</p>
       <p><b>Peer  Review</b></p>

      <p>Manuscripts  submitted in the first three categories (<strong>Original Articles, Reviews and  Technical Communications</strong>) are reviewed by at least two expert consultants,  chosen by the associate editor appointed for each article. In addition to the  reviewers, the Editor may issue comments and criticism regarding the style  and/or the content of the manuscript.<br>
        Upon  submission of the revised manuscript, authors must provide responses to all of  the reviewers&rsquo; and editor&rsquo;s comments and recommendations on a point-to-point  basis.</p>
       <p><b>Language</b></p>
   
      <p>Manuscripts  must be submitted in English.</p>
      <p>Clear English  phrasing is mandatory for review and publication.</p>
      <p>The authors  are the sole responsible for the contents of the text, including the  appropriate use of English language, which is a requirement for review and  publication. Submitted manuscripts may be turned out or rejected for poor use  of language.</p>
      <p>For nonnative  speakers, professional English editing services may help improve the  presentation of the manuscript prior to journal submission and publication. Examples  of such external professional services (not excluding others) are: American  Journal Experts (<a href="http://www.journalexperts.com/" target="_blank">www.journalexperts.com</a>); Scribendi (<a href="http://www.scribendi.com/" target="_blank">www.scribendi.com</a>);  Nature Publishing Groups Language Editing (<a href="https://identity.languageediting.nature.com/auth/signin" target="_blank">https://languageediting.nature.com/login</a>);  Enago (<a href="http://www.enago.com.br/" target="_blank">http://www.enago.com.br</a>);  Edanz (<a href="http://www.edanzediting.com/" target="_blank">http://www.edanzediting.com/</a>);  Editage (<a href="http://www.editage.com.br/" target="_blank">http://www.editage.com.br/</a>).  Authors are free to use the service that best suits their needs.</p>
      <p>Even when external services are used, the sole  and final responsibility regarding the manuscript contents remains with the  authors. </p>
      <p><strong>Manuscript Preparation</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Manuscripts must be  posted in a single &quot;<strong><em>.doc</em></strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong><em>.docx</em></strong>&quot;  or &quot;<strong><em>.rtf</em></strong>&quot; file, containing the main text, references,  figures and tables.</li>
        <li>Adjust paper size to  A4, margins 2.0 cm, single column, double spaced and Times New Roman font-size  12.</li>
        <li><strong>All pages and lines  must be numbered continuously.</strong></li>
        <li>Manuscripts must  begin with a <strong>front page</strong> containing: title of the article, full names and  addresses (department, faculty, university, city and country) of all authors,  full address and email of the corresponding author, and a running title (short  title).</li>

      </ul>
