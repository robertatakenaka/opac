   <p><b>General rules to obtain a good scientific writing:</b></p>
   <ol>
     <li> Use active voice</li>
     <li>Sentences must be short, clear and objective</li>
     <li>Units of measurement are abbreviated when use with numerical values (e.g., 1 mg), but are not abbreviated if used without numerical values. Systeme International d'&Uacute;nites (SI units) must be used. Remember to leave a space between the number and unit (e.g., 10 mg/dL), except for the percentage mark that follows the number without space (e.g., 70%). The plural form of units of measurement is the same as the singular form (e.g., 1 mL, 10 mL; 1 h, 10 h). Spell out numbers at the beginning of a sentence</li>
     <li>Defi ne abbreviations the fi rst time they appear. Avoid abbreviations in tittles and abstracts</li>
     <li>Do not use contractions (e.g., doesn't, can't etc.)</li>
   </ol>

   <p><b>Legal and ethical considerations</b></p>
  <p>According to the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors - February 2006).</p>
  <p><b>Conflict of interest</b></p>
  <p>Public trust in the peer review process and the credibility of published articles depend in part on how well conflict of interest is handled during writing, peer review, and editorial decision making. Conflict of interest exists when an author (or the author’s institution), reviewer, or editor has financial or personal relationships that inappropriately influence (bias) his or her actions (such relationships are also known as dual commitments, competing interests, or competing loyalties). These relationships vary from those with negligible potential to those with great potential to influence judgment, and not all relationships represent true conflict of interest. The potential for conflict of interest can exist whether or not an individual believes that the relationship affects his or her scientific judgment. Financial relationships (such as employment, consultancies, stock ownership, honoraria, paid expert testimony) are the most easily identifiable conflicts of interest and the most likely to undermine the credibility of the journal, the authors, and of science itself. However, conflicts can occur for other reasons, such as personal relationships, academic competition, and intellectual passion.</p>
  <p><b>Informed consent</b></p>
  <p>Patients have a right to privacy, that should not be infringed without informed consent. Identifying information, including patients’ names, initials, or hospital numbers, should not be published in written descriptions, photographs, and pedigrees unless the information is essential for scientific purposes and the patient (or parent or guardian) gives written informed consent for publication. Informed consent for this purpose requires that a patient who is identifi able be shown the manuscript to be published. Authors should identify Individuals who provide writing assistance and disclose the funding source for this assistance. Identifying details should be omitted if they are not essential.</p>
  <p>Complete anonymity is difficult to achieve. However, an informed consent should be obtained if there is any doubt. For example, masking the eye  region in photographs of patients is inadequate protection of anonymity. If identifying characteristics are altered to protect anonymity, such as in genetic pedigrees, authors should provide assurance that alterations do not distort scientific meaning and editors should so note. When informed consent has been obtained it should be indicated in the published article.</p>
  <p><b>Ethical treatment</b></p>
  <p>When reporting experiments on human subjects, authors should indicate whether the procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human  experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000. If doubt exists whether the research was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration, the authors must explain the rationale for their approach, and demonstrate that the institutional review body explicitly approved the doubtful aspects of the study. When reporting experiments on animals, authors should be asked to indicate whether the institutional and national guide for the care and use of laboratory animals was followed.</p>
  <p><b>Clinical trials registry</b></p>
  <p>Clinical trials must be registered according to WHO recommendation at <a href="http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/" target="_blank">www.who.int/ictrp/en/</a>. The defi nition of clinical trial include preliminary trials (phase I): any study with prospective recruiting of subjects to undergo any health-related intervention (drugs, surgical procedures, equipment, behavioral therapies, food regimen, changes in health care) to evaluate the effects on clinical outcomes (any biomedical or health-related parameter, including pharmacokinetics measurements and adverse reactions). The BJR has the right not to publish trials not complying with these and other legal and ethical standards determined by international guidelines.</p>
  <p><b>Financing and support</b></p>
  <p>The authors should also inform if they received financing or support from institutions like CNPq, CAPES, SBR Remaining Funds, Graduated Institutions, Laboratories etc.</p>
