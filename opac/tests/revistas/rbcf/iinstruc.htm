      <p>The Brazilian Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences/Revista Brasileira de 
        Ci&ecirc;ncias Farmac&ecirc;uticas (RBCF) accepts for publication <b>Original 
        Papers</b> applicable to the fields of Pharmaceutical Sciences; <b>Reviews 
        and Current Comment Articles</b>, which are published under the Editorial 
        Board invitation to recognized experts or when they are spontaneously 
        submitted by the authors in the form of abstracts to have their importance 
        evaluated. A critical vision of the subject with insertions of results 
        of previous works in the field in relation to the state of the art in 
        the country must be included; <b>Short Communications </b>reporting new 
        methods and previews of works on researches of outstanding importance 
        in which originality justify a quick publication. A maximum of 2000 words 
        excluding tables, figures and references is an acceptable limit. One table, 
        one figure and ten references may be added, and <b>Book Reviews</b> of 
        the latest editions, prepared by specialists invited by the Editorial 
        Board. <b>Thematic Supplements</b> as well as those related to scientific 
        meetings can be published under the Editorial Board agreement.</p>
      <p>Manuscripts can be submitted by either Brazilian or foreign specialists 
        written in one of the following languages: Portuguese, English or Spanish. 
        A manuscript is accepted with the understanding that the material has 
        not been previously published, except in abstract form, and that it is 
        not simultaneously under consideration by any other journal. All manuscripts 
        submitted to Brazilian Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences / Revista Brasileira 
        de Ci&ecirc;ncias Farmac&ecirc;uticas that follow the <b>instructions 
        to authors</b> are subject to peer review by two or more independent, 
        anonymous referees chosen by the Scientific Editor. Additional opinions 
        are sought by the Scientific Editor when there are substantial differences 
        between reviewers. After being reviewed all manuscripts are forwarded 
        to the Editorial Board for a final decision. Rejected manuscripts may 
        be resubmitted for consideration without any reference to the previous 
        submission as a new manuscript after being properly and significantly 
        restructured. If revision is necessary, the authors are asked to resubmit 
        the dated, revised manuscript incorporating the suggestions and recommendations 
        of the referees within two months. Revisions not received within two months 
        from the date of notice will have its process canceled. All revisions 
        must be accompanied with a letter detailing the changes made to the original 
        document; changes should also be indicated directly on the manuscript. 
        Revisions may be re-reviewed at the discretion of the Scientific Editor. 
        Papers accepted for publication will have their copyright assigned to 
        the REVISTA. A copyright transfer form will be sent to the authors for 
        signature together with the final proof of the paper. </p>

      <p>The Revista Brasileira de Ci&ecirc;ncias Farmac&ecirc;uticas/Brazilian 
        Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences edited trimestrally by the School of 
        Pharmaceutical Sciences - University of S&atilde;o Paulo, giving priority 
        to the publication of Original Articles of Pharmaceutical Sciences. It 
        also publishes short communications, Technical Notes and Book Reviews.

        publication. Also these articles can be previously submitted in abstract 
        form to evaluate the interest in publishing them. The provision of up-to-date 
        information on the latest advanced areas of Pharmaceutical Sciences is 
        one of the main services that RBCFUSP offers to its readers. Contributions

      <p><b>STRUCTURE</b></p>
      <p><b>Title Page:</b> This should include the manuscript full title (it 
        must be brief providing exact information of the contents), authors' full 
        names, institutional affiliations (University, College, Department). Give 
        as a foot-note the name, full address including E-mail of the corresponding 
        author identified with an asterisk.</p>
      <p><b>Summary:</b> On a separate page, provide a summary of not more than 
        200 words. It must be structured and consist of four parts. Each part 
        of the structured summary should concisely and specifically describe the 
        objectives of the study, techniques used, the essential results and what 
        the authors concluded from the results.</p>
      <p><b>Uniterms:</b> These should be strictly related to the contents and 
        limited to 6 (six).</p>
      <p><b>Introduction:</b> This should state briefly and clearly the objectives 
        of the investigation with reference to previous works. Extensive review 
        of the literature should be avoided and substitute for references of recent 
        publications where such reviews may be found.</p>
      <p><b>Material and Methods:</b> These should be described in sufficient 
        detail that the work can be reproduced. Procedures and techniques readily 
        available in the literature require only a citation of the original source, 
        except when they are substantially modified. Reports of experimental studies 
        on humans and animals must certify that the research received prior approval 
        by the appropriate institutional review body (Committee of Bioethics).</p>
      <p><b>Results and Discussion:</b> Results must be presented concisely and 
        in logical order. Where possible use figures or tables to present data 
        rather than text. When appropriate give the range, standard deviation 
        and indicate the significances of differences between numerical values 
        obtained. Discussion should interpret the results and assess their significance 
        in relation to previous work in the field. Speculation not warranted by 
        actual data should be avoided. Presenting those items separately is optional. 
      </p>
      <p><b>Conclusions:</b> These must be drawn from the text and restricted 
        to the limits of data obtained</p>
      <p><b>Abstract in Portuguese:</b> It should be preceded by the title in 
        Portuguese. This should follow the same content of the summary presented 
        in English. Members of the Editorial Board can kindly assist those authors 
        not fluent in the Portuguese language.</p>
      <p><b>Uniterms in Portuguese:</b> must follow uniterms in English.</p>
      <p><b>Acknowledgments:</b> These should be typed in a special paragraph 
        under separate heading preceding the section of References. They should 
        be kept to a minimum consistent with the requirements of courtesy and 
        disclosure.</p>
      <p><b>References:</b> They should be prepared and listed according to The 
        Brazilian Association of Technical Standards (ABNT.NBR 6023). Entries 
        should be arranged in alphabetical order by author at the end of the paper. 
        All authors' names should be given. &quot;Accuracy of reference data is 
        the responsibility of the author&quot;. For research and examples see 
        the site <a href="http://www.bcq.usp.br" target="_blank">www.bcq.usp.br</a>. 
      </p>
      <p><b>PRESENTATION OF MANUSCRIPTS</b></p>
      <p>Manuscripts should be sent in three copies, in an official/regular sheet 
        of paper (30-36 lines, double spaced) in the Word for Windows program 
        or preferentially on line via <a href="http://www.rbcf.br" target="_blank">http://www.rbcf.br</a>. 
        All submissions must be accompanied with a letter signed by the authors. 
        RBCF requires that the accepted final corrected copy of each manuscript 
        be submitted electronically (on micro floppy disk or via <a href="http://www.rbcf.br" target="_blank">http://www.rbcf.br</a>). 
        Traditional paper version is also accepted. </p>
