   <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Brazilian Journal of Food Technology</strong>&nbsp;(BJFT)  is an electronic rolling pass publication with free access, aimed at publishing  original research results and  technological information that contribute significantly to knowledge related to  food production and assessment in the areas of food science, technology,  engineering and nutrition (not  clinical) in Brazil. Manuscripts with national and/or  international scope presenting new concepts or experimental approaches, and  which are not merely repositories of scientific data, are accepted.</p>
   <p>
    The journal publishes original and authentic articles, short communications, review articles, case reports, critical book reviews, article comments an effective communications in Portuguese, English and Spanish. Submission of a manuscript presupposes that the same content has not been published or is under analysis for publication in any other divulging vehicle. The Author(s) is responsible for the article&rsquo;s content and will be required to provide retractions or corrections, if necessary.</p>
   <p>
    Articles specifically contemplating analytical methodologies will be accepted as long as they are innovative or provide significant improvement to existing methods. It is at the discretion of the Editors, depending on the subject relevance, the acceptance of works with test results of industrialized products without the information necessary to manufacture them. Papers aimed essentially at commercial propaganda will not be accepted.</p>

   <p>Manuscript submitted for publication in the BJFT is previously evaluated by an Editor and, depending on the general quality of the work, it may be rejected or returned to the Authors for adjustments or sent to two <em>ad hoc </em>Reviewers. The whole process is a blind review. The reviewers&rsquo; evaluations are sent to the Associate Editor, who qualifies the manuscript&rsquo;s pertinence for publication. In case of discordance between the reviewers, other reviewers may be consulted. If the publication is possible, the reviewers and Associate Editor evaluations are sent to the Authors for them to verify the suggestions and carry out any pertinent modifications, which should be inserted in the text highlighted in a different color. There is no limit for the number of revisions, this is an interactive process and it depends on the agility of the Reviewers and the Editor in issuing their evaluations and on the Authors in returning the reviewed article. At the end of the process, the final decision is up to the Editor in Chief to approve or to reject the manuscript publication, subsided by the Associate Editor recommendation and the reviewers evaluation. This peer review system is the self-regulatory mechanism adopted by the Journal to certify the credibility of the researches to be published.</p>
 
   <p>When the work presents research results involving the participation of human beings, in accordance to Brazilian Resolution 466/12 of the National Health Council from Brazil, the project approval number by a Research Ethics Committee must be informed.</p>

   <p>Articles are published in order of approval, in the Journal&rsquo;s online version at http://bjft.ital.sp.gov.br and at the Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO).</p>
  
   <p>BJFT is supported by Institute of Food Technology - ITAL, linked to the Paulista Agribusiness Technology Agency, the Secretariat of Agriculture and Supply of S&atilde;o Paulo State.</p>

   <p><strong>NORMS FOR SUBMISSION</strong></p>
   <p><strong>1. CONTENT AND CLASSIFICATION OF THE DOCUMENTS FOR PUBLICATION</strong></p>
   <p>National and international manuscripts presenting new concepts or experimental approaches and not simply scientific data repositories will be accepted. Papers specifically contemplating analytical methodologies will be accepted as long as they are innovative or provide significant improvement to existing methods. &ldquo;It is at the discretion of the Editors, depending on the subject relevance, the acceptance of works with test results of industrialized products without the information necessary to manufacture them.&rdquo; Papers aimed essentially at commercial propaganda will not be accepted.</p>
   <p>Papers published in the BJFT are classified into these categories.</p>
   <p>1.1.ORIGINAL SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES: These are articles that report the methodology, the final results and the conclusions of original research, structured and documented such that they can be reproduced with margins of error equal or below the limits indicated by the author. The work should not have been previously published, except in the preliminary form as a scientific note or a congress abstract.</p>
   <p>1.2. REVIEW ARTICLES: These are interrelated extracts from the available literature about a subject that fits into the scope of this journal and which contain conclusions about the available knowledge. They should preferably be based on literature published in the last five years.</p>
   <p>1.3. SCIENTIFIC NOTES: These are partial reports of original research which, due to their relevance, justify prior publication. They should follow the same standard as a scientific article and could subsequently be published in the complete form as a Scientific Article.</p>
   <p>1.4. CASE STUDIES: These are descriptions of cases of which the results are technically relevant.</p>
   <p>1.5. CRITICAL BOOK REVIEWS: This is an analysis of one or more books, either printed or online, presenting a summary and critical analysis of the contents.</p>
   <p>1.6. ARTICLE  COMMENTS: A  document of which the object or focus is another article or articles.</p>
   <p>1.7. SHORT COMMUNICATIONS: Update on a research project or other items of note.</p>
  <p>The manuscripts may be presented in Portuguese, English or Spanish.</p>

   - All the lines and pages of the manuscript should be numbered in sequence. <br>
   - Itemizing of the sections and subsections should not exceed 3 levels. <br>
   - The number of pages, including Figures and Tables in the text, should not be greater than 20 for Original Scientific and Review Articles or 9 for other types of document. We suggest that the presentation and discussion of the results be as concise as possible. <br>
   - Use short phrases.</p>
  <p>2.2. UNITS OF MEASUREMENT: The International Unit System (SI) should be used and the temperature should be expressed in degrees Celsius.</p>
  <p>2.3. TABLES &amp; FIGURES: These must be numbered with Arabic numbers in the order they are mentioned in the text. Titles must be immediately above tables and immediately below figures, and must not contain units. Units must be between brackets in tables and figures. Tables must be inserted in the manuscript body soon after being mentioned. Photographs should be designated as figures. The location of tables and figures in the text  should be identified.</p>
  <p>The TABLES should be edited using the resources of the WORD text editor available for this end, using only horizontal lines. They should be self-explanatory and easy to read and understand. Footnotes should be indicated by lowercase superscript letters. First demarcate the columns and then the lines and follow the same sequence for the footnotes.</p>
  <p>The FIGURES should preferably be used to highlight the more expressive results. They should not repeat information found in Tables. They should be presented so as to allow a clear visualization and interpretation of their content. The captions should be short, self-explanatory and with no edges. The Figures (graphs and photos) <strong>should be in colour and in high definition (300 dpi)</strong>, so as to be easily interpreted. Photos should be in the form of a JPG or TIF file. The Figures should be sent (File upload) in individual files, <strong>separate from the main text</strong>, on submitting the manuscript. These individual files should be named according to the figure number. Example: Fig1.jpg, Fig2.tif etc.</p>
  <p>2.4. EQUATIONS: The equations should appear in an editable form and only in the text, that is, they should not be presented as figures or sent in separate files.</p>
  <p>We recommend the use of MathType or Equation Editor of the MS Word type to present equations in the text. Do not mix the tools MathType or Equation Editor in the same equation or mix these resources to insert symbols. Also do not use MathType or Equation Editor to present simple variables in the manuscript text (e.g., a=b<sup>2</sup>+c<sup>2</sup>), Greek letters and symbols (e.g., &#945;, _&#8734;, &#8710;) or mathematical operations (e.g., x, &#177;, &#8805;). Whenever possible, when editing the manuscript text, use the tool &ldquo;insert symbols&rdquo;..</p>
  <p>They should be cited in the text and numbered in increasing sequential order, in Arabic numerals between parentheses, close to the right hand margin.</p>
  <p>2.5. ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS: When strictly necessary, abbreviations and acronyms should be defined the first time they are mentioned.

<p>Indirect  citation: text based on the work of the consulted author (only the date must be  indicated).</p>
<p>In  bibliographical citations in the text (based on ABNT NBR 10520: 2002), callings  by author's last name, responsible institution or title included in the  sentence must be in uppercase and lowercase letters and, when they are in  parentheses, must be capitalized (uppercase). Examples:</p>
<p>Guerrero &amp; Alzamorra (1998) obtained a good fit  for the model. <br>
  These results are in agreement with those found for  other products (CAMARGO e RASERAS, 2006; LEE e STORN, 2001).</p>
<p>The citation of  many documents from the same author, published in the same year, are distinguished  by adding lower case letters, in alphabetic order, after date, with no space,  according to the reference list. Examples:</p>
<p>According to Reeside (1927a)<br>
  (REESIDE, 1927b)</p>
<p>To quote from a  citation, the expression &ldquo;apud&rdquo; (quoted by, according to) must be used after  the reference publication year, followed by the secondary source effectively  consulted. Examples:</p>
<p>In the text: &ldquo;[&hellip;] in the Letter from 1946.&rdquo; (VIANNA,  1986, p. 172 apud SEGATTO, 1995).</p>
<p>On this subject, the words from Silva may be  clarifying (1986 apud CARNEIRO, 1981). </p>
<p>3.11.2 References</p>
<p>The references  list must follow the norms established by the Brazilian Technical Norms  Association (ABNT), Norm: NBR 6023, August, 2002, in the following way:</p>

<p>4. <strong>EVALUATION  PROCESS</strong>.</p>
<p>Paper submitted for publication in the BJFT is previously evaluated by an Editor and, depending on the general quality of the work, it may be rejected or returned to the Authors for adjustments or sent to two ad hoc Reviewers. The whole process is a blind review. The reviewers&rsquo; evaluations are sent to the Associate Editor, who qualifies the manuscript&rsquo;s pertinence for publication. In case of discordance between the reviewers, other reviewers may be consulted. If the publication is possible, the reviewers and Associate Editor evaluations are sent to the Authors for them to verify the suggestions and carry out any pertinent modifications, which should be inserted in the text highlighted in a different color.
