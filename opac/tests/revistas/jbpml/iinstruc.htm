      <p><b>Original articles</b><br>
        They are intended to report the original unpublished research results 
        that may be replicated and generalized. The articles may have a maximum 
        of 4 thousand words. The formal structure must follow the presentation 
        structure of this kind of article: Introduction, Objectives, Material 
        and Method, Results, Discussion, Conclusions and References.<br>
        The use of subtitles is recommended, particularly in Discussion. Clinical 
        implications and study limitations must be clearly stated. The topic Material 
        and Method should be thoroughly detailed. In these articles, the presentation 
        of a structured abstract in Portuguese and English is required with the 
        formal presentation of the article: Introduction, Objectives, Material 
        and Method, Results, Discussion, Conclusions and References. The abstract 
        in English must be preceded by the title in English. The references must 
        be at the end of the text according to the following standards.</p>
      <p><b>Brief communications</b><br>
        They are short reports that must present: 1) preliminary study data with 
        suggestive findings that guarantee a more definite investigation; 2) replication 
        studies; and 3) negative studies of important topics. These articles must 
        have a maximum of 1,500 words, including non-structured abstract, one 
        table or image at most, as well as the References.</p>
      <p><b>Review articles</b><br>
        Review articles will be accepted by means of an invitation.<br>
        They are systematized critical evaluation of the literature about a certain 
        topic, which must state conclusions and have up to 5 thousand words. The 
        organization of the article is up to the author, apart from Introduction, 
        Discussion and Conclusion. A structured abstract of the text in its original 
        language and another one in English are required. An extensive list of 
        references must appear at the end of the text.</p>
      <p><b>Update articles</b><br>
        They are descriptive and interpretative texts based on the recent literature 
        about the global situation in which a certain topic is found. It must 
        have a maximum of 3 thousand words. The structure of the text is decided 
        by the author, but it must contain a non-structured abstract in the original 
        language and another one in English, as well as the references.</p>
      <p><b>Case reports</b><br>
        They are original clinical-laboratory observations followed by analysis 
        and discussion. They must have up to 1,500 words. The structure must present 
        at least the following topics: Introduction, Case reports, and Discussion. 
        Include a non-structured abstract in the original language and another 
        one in English.</p>
      <p><b>Letters to the Editor</b><br>
        They are letters that aim at discussing the recent articles published 
        in the magazine or reporting original research or relevant scientific 
        findings. Brief letters with a maximum of 500 words (including bibliography, 
        no tables and pictures) will be considered if the sentence &quot;for publication&quot; 
        is explicit.</p>
