Submission of these  manuscripts is not free, and limited to authors invited by the Editor.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Systematic literature review:</strong> analysis of an extensive corpus of research on subjects of interest for  the development of Psychology. A systematic review should describe the method  used to search the original studies in detail, and <em><strong>Paid&eacute;ia</strong></em> indicates the use of  one of the following guidelines: PRISMA,  Cochrane Collaboration, as well as the elaboration of the question guiding the  review in the PICO, PICOT or PICOS format. It is also necessary to clarify the  criteria used to select the studies that were included in the review and the  procedures employed in the synthesis of the results obtained from the studies  reviewed (which may be the meta-analysis or not). Authors  are expected to clearly define a central question of the review and, by  analyzing the scientific literature, identify relations, contradictions, gaps  and / or inconsistencies in the literature. Based on the results, authors are  also expected to suggest the next steps of research to solve the problems  identified. The review should be limited to 25 pages, including&nbsp;<em>resumo</em>,  abstract,&nbsp;<em>resumen</em>, figures, tables and references (excluding the  title page).</p>

  <tr>
    <td width="15%"></td>
    <td width="70%"><p>The  editorial review process only starts if the submitted manuscript strictly  complies with the conditions published in the Publication Guidelines. If this  is not the case, the submitted manuscript will be refused and filed. If a  manuscript fits into one of the publication categories specified above, it will  be submitted to pre-analysis by the Editorial Board. After checking for  compliance with all Publication Guidelines, it will be forwarded for review by <em>ad hoc </em>consultants, presupposing that:  (a) it has not been published elsewhere or is not under other editors analysis,  (b) manuscripts with similar contents  should not have been published or be under any other editor&rsquo;s analysis, (c) all  listed authors approved its submission to <strong><em>Paid&eacute;ia</em></strong> for publication; (d) any  person mentioned as a source of personal communication previously approved his/her citation through the signing of a written document.
      <p> The  editorial process of <strong><em>Paid&eacute;ia</em></strong> is based on double blind peer  review, which means that the authors and <em>ad  hoc </em>reviewers&rsquo; identities are not revealed. The process starts when the  manuscript is submitted to <strong><em>Paid&eacute;ia</em></strong>, followed by a confirmation  receipt from the journal Secretariat. First, the Editorial Board analyzes the  original, based on the following criteria: (a) contents in accordance with the  journal&rsquo;s editorial line; (b) originality, relevance of the theme and quality of  the scientific method used; (c) compliance with the editorial standards the  journal adopts; (d) if the manuscript is submitted in a  foreign language, intelligibility and correction of the writing.
      <p> The  result of this pre-analysis phase can be: (a) the manuscript returns to the authors  for modifications, in case formal requirements are not complied with; (b) rejection  or (c) continuation of the review process if the manuscript complies with the  above criteria.
      <p> Next,  the Editorial Board will analyze the submitted papers, supported by <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers of renowned competence  in the specific knowledge area. The abstract is used to consult the reviewers.  In general, between three and five researchers are invited to issue their  expert opinion. In case an invited reviewer meets any impediment to pronounce  him/herself on the manuscript (professional or financial conflict of interests,  direct and indirect benefits), the Editorial Board should be informed. The  first review round starts with the forwarding of the full manuscript to those  reviewers who accepted the invitation. At least two reviewers assessed each  manuscript. The analysis will be based on the assessment instrument the journal  adopts. After an accurate analysis of the submitted manuscript, the reviewers  suggest rejection or recommend publication &ndash; which can be conditioned to  recommended changes. Each reviewer issues an opinion on a standard form and  finishes with his/her judgment, marking one out of five alternatives below,  three of which refer to possible acceptance and two to rejection.
      <p> In  conditions for acceptance: Excellent; Good, with some shortages; Good, but  needs a broad review.
      <p> No  conditions for acceptance: Needs extensive reformulation for resubmission;  Rejected for publication.
      <p> Acceptance  of the submitted manuscript can be conditioned to modifications that aim to  improve the text&rsquo;s clarity or precision. The authors will receive the full  versions of the reviewers&rsquo; opinions. The Editorial Board can further comment on  the manuscript and inform this to the authors. Manuscripts recommended for  publication but subject to modifications should be reformulated with a view to  final acceptance. The reformulated version should be returned within 30 days,  together with a letter from the authors to the Editorial Board, submitted in an  additional document, listing the changes that were made based on the criticism/suggestions  in the reviewers&rsquo; opinions, and justifying any suggestions that were not  accepted. If the authors do not forward the revised manuscript and response  letter within this deadline, the editorial process will be terminated, in any  phase of the submission process.
      <p> The Editorial Board will  assess the response letter with the justifications, the reformulated manuscript  and the Editorial Board&rsquo;s opinion on the original version. If necessary, these  documents can also be forwarded to the <em>ad  hoc </em>consultants, who will assess the reformulations in line with the  opinions issued, also assessing consistencies in the authors&rsquo; arguments. After  this analysis, it is the responsibility of the Board to judge whether the  manuscript can be published or requires further changes, or if it will be  rejected. If the Editorial Board decides that the manuscript needs further  changes, a new reformulation will be requested, following the process described  above. Manuscripts can be submitted to two reformulations at most.
      <p> If the  manuscript displays conditions for acceptance, the Editorial Board will submit  the opinions and text to a final analysis, looking for any further changes  needed. If approved, the manuscript will be forwarded for the final  standardization procedures with a view to publication. It should be clarified  that, based on the opinions issued, the Editor-in-Chief is responsible for  making the final judgment on the manuscript&rsquo;s acceptance or refusal. The  authors will be informed of this decision.
      <p>In  specific situations (inconsistent opinions, ethical issues, ambivalent judgment,  among others), the reformulated version of the manuscript can also be forwarded  to a third <em>ad hoc </em>reviewer. In this  analysis, the reviewer can reject the manuscript, suggest further changes (s)he  may find necessary or accept the reformulated version. The Editorial Board will  analyze the opinions to decide on whether or not to recommend publication.
      <p> The  approved manuscript will be forwarded for bibliographic review by the journal&rsquo;s  librarian, followed by standardization by the Editorial and Technical Team of <strong><em>Paid&eacute;ia</em></strong>,  with a view to final formal corrections. Small modifications in the text  writing/structure can be made, upon the Board&rsquo;s decision. After these  procedures, the approved manuscripts are forwarded for design. The composition  of the papers approved for publication in each journal issue is based on the  diversification of authorship per geographical region and institution, which  implies that acceptance of the manuscript is not conditioned to its immediate  publication.        
        
        PDF  files are forwarded to the librarian team for indexation and to a specialized  professional to prepare the texts in the SciELO method. The final phase  involves the distribution of print copies to authors, indexers, libraries  linked with the Brazilian Network of Psychology Libraries (ReBAP), the  editorial board and <em>ad hoc </em>consultants.  Each author of a published paper will receive a copy of the issue in which  his/her study was published. In the final issue of each journal volume, the  list of <em>ad hoc </em>consultants who  cooperated with the assessment of manuscripts in that year will be published.</td>

      <p><em><strong>Paid&eacute;ia</strong></em> fully  adopts the publication standards of the Publication Manual of the American  Psychological Association (6th edition, 2010). It is  important to observe some steps before submitting the manuscript: (1) carefully  revise the text for grammatical correction, typos and bibliographic errors,  also considering the items included in the submission; (2) check whether all  requisites of the Publication Guidelines were complied with.
      <p> When submitting online, the  manuscript should be submitted to <strong><em>Paid&eacute;ia</em></strong> in one of the following  languages: Portuguese, English or Spanish. Texts should be formatted as  follows: double lining (distance of 1 cm between lines), justified, in font Times New Roman, size  12, across the text, especting the page limit. The manuscript should be number  as from the title page, which will receive page number 1. The A4  format should be adopted, with 2.5cm margins (upper, lower, left and right) and  indentation of the first line of the paragraph: tab = 1.25cm.
      <p> The presentation of the papers has to follow a  specific order, considering:
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>1. Title page without personal data, including:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p> 1.1. Full title in  Portuguese, not exceeding 12 words;</p>
          <p> 1.2.  Full title in  English, compatible with the Portuguese version;</p>
          <p> 1.3. Full title in  Spanish, compatible with the Portuguese version;</p>
          <p> 1.4. Suggested running title in English, not exceeding 50 characters (including letters, punctuation  and spaces).</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Attention</strong>: As  the manuscript is submitted to blind review. The authors are responsible for checking that there are no elements  capable of identifying them in any  part of the text. <strong><em>Paid&eacute;ia</em></strong> is not responsible for  procedures by authors who do not comply with this guideline. The author&rsquo;s name  should be removed from the file properties, using the tool &ldquo;Properties&rdquo;, in the  file menu of MS Word, and from any other part of the submitted manuscript. No  attachments and appendices will be accepted, nor colored illustrations,  reproductions of photographs, shadowed tables or footnotes in the text.  Reproduction of any part of published works will only be permitted if  accompanied by the authors&rsquo; authorization for publication in <strong><em>Paid&eacute;ia</em></strong>.</p>
        <p> In                case of approval, papers will be published in the full                version in English (in print and online). In other words, for  publication, the authors have to provide for the translation of the manuscript  (as approved) to English and cover the costs of this translation. To guarantee  the quality and uniformity of texts translated into English, only accredited  translators are allowed to perform these translations. The Committee of  Accredited Translators comprises highly qualified professionals with proven  experience in scientific translations. </p>
        <p>No submission or article evaluation fees are due (APCs charges and submission charges).</p>
        <p><strong>2. Abstract,  in Portuguese.</strong> The  abstract limit is 150 words. In case of research reports, the abstract should  include: a short description of the research problem, purpose, relevant sample  characteristics, data collection method, results and conclusions (or final  considerations for qualitative studies). Final considerations should present  the implications or applications of the produced knowledge. For research  reports, the method should provide consistent information about the  participants, instruments and procedures used. Only the most important results,  which respond to the research purposes, should be mentioned in the abstract. No  references should be included.<br>
          The abstract has to be followed by three to five  keywords for indexation, which should accurately classify the paper, permitting  a fast recovery with similar papers in case of a bibliographic research.  Keywords have to be selected through the instrument available at: http://www.bvs-psi.org.br/  &ndash; consult: Terminologies and Psi Terminology , where the Vocabulary of Terms in  Psychology is available. <br>
          Abstracts of systematic literature reviews or  theoretical studies should included: topic addressed (in a statement),  objective, thesis or construct under analysis or study organizer, used sources  (e.g. an observation made by the author, published literature), and  conclusions.</p>
        <p><strong>3. &nbsp;<em>Abstract.</em></strong> The  abstract limit is 150 words. It should  comply with the same specifications as the Portuguese version, including the Keywords,  in accordance with the Vocabulary of Terms in Psychology.</p>
        <p><strong>4. <em>Resumen.</em></strong> The  abstract limit is 150 words. It should comply with the same specifications as the Portuguese  version, including the <em>Palabras  clave</em>, in accordance with the Vocabulary  of Terms in Psychology. </p>
        <p><strong>5. The text itself. </strong>The organization of the manuscript should be easy to recognize, signaled  by a system of titles and subtitles that reflect this pattern. The text should  start with an introduction and include the following headings: Method, Results  and Discussion. As the introduction of the manuscript is easily identified by  its place in the text, the heading Introduction is not necessary. In the  research reports, the Method section must include the following subheadings:  Participants, Instruments, Procedure (the latter subdivided into Data  collection and Data analysis) and, finally, the subheading Ethical  Considerations, in which the authors should mention the approval of the  Research Ethics Committee, the name of the institution the committee is  affiliated with and the protocol number. Authors should finish the Discussion  section with a well reasoned comment, justifying the importance of the study  findings. In this section, the authors should present the main contributions  the research offers to the knowledge area within Psychology. Besides the  implications and possible applications of the knowledge produced, authors  should also point out the limitations of the study and its consequences in  terms of prospects for future investigations.</p>
        <p>          Suggested places to include figures  and tables have to be indicated in the text. Quotations of other authors have  to be done according to APA standards,  as exemplified under section VII. Full transcriptions of a text have to be  delimited by quotation marks and reference to the author, followed by the  number of the page referred to. A literal quotation with 40 or more words has  to be presented in a single block, starting with a new line, 05 (five) spaces  from the border, in the same position as a paragraph. The font size should be  12, similar to the rest of the text. This type of citation should be avoided  Authors are fully responsible for the contents and exactness of citations. </p>
        <p><strong>6. References. </strong>The references used should be coherent with the study&rsquo;s  theoretical-methodological framework. In this sense, literature on the research  theme should be recovered, privileging scientific papers to the detriment of  other publication modes. References should be up-to-date. At least 50% should  date back to the last five years, counted from the submission date.  Non-compliance with this guideline implies return of the manuscript to the  authors. The Editor, with support from the Editorial Board and <em>ad hoc </em>reviewers, can judge special  cases that do not strictly fit into this criterion. </p>
        <p><strong>7.</strong> <strong>Figures </strong>and<strong> Tables</strong> should be inserted after the References section. The  suggested place of insertion should be indicated in the body of the text  though. The words Figure and Table in the texts should always be spelled with  the first letter in upper case, followed by the respective number they refer  to. Expressions like &ldquo;the Table above&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Figure below&rdquo; should not be  used, as locations can change during the editing process. APA standards do not  include the names Charts and Graphs, but only Tables and Figures. Figures and  Tables should be presented with their respective legends and titles, one per  page.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>7.1 Figures,</strong> including subtitles, in black and white. As the  published version cannot exceed 8.3   cm width for single figures and 17.5 cm width for complex  figures, the author should make sure that no subtitle quality is lost in case width  reduction is necessary. Reproductions of drawings will not be accepted. The  quantity of figures and tables cannot exceed five. </p>
          <p><strong>7.2 Tables,</strong> including titles and notes, should be produced in  black and white, one per page. The published table cannot exceed (17.5 x 23.7)  cm (width x length). When preparing them, the author should limit the width to  60 characters for single tables to occupy a printed column, including three  character-spaces between table columns, limiting complex tables to a 125-character  width to occupy two printed columns. The table length cannot exceed 55 lines,  including title and footnotes. For other details, especially for anomalous  cases, please refer to APA&rsquo;s manual. The quantity of figures and tables cannot  exceed five units.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> Numerical  and statistical information should be presented in compliance with the  Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association(6th edition, 2010). For  manuscripts written in Portuguese, numerical information should be standardized  in line with Carzola, Silva and Vendramini (2009) in the book <em>Publicar em Psicologia: Um enfoque para a  revista cient&iacute;fica</em>, which can be accessed free of charge at the following  electronic address:        &nbsp;<a href="http://www.ip.usp.br/portal/images/stories/biblioteca/Publicar-em-Psicologia.pdf">http://www.ip.usp.br/portal/images/stories/biblioteca/Publicar-em-Psicologia.pdf</a></p>
        <p> In  case of papers written in Portuguese, the authors should solve occasional  inconsistencies between APA standards and writing in Portuguese, in view of  general rules for writing in that language.</p>
        <p> Formatting  of the manuscript, tables, figures and other elements should strictly comply  with the APA manual. Before submitting, the authors should assess whether the  manuscript complies with the checklist displayed on pages 241-243 of the APA  manual. Non-compliance with these elements can represent a reason for the  Editorial Board to reject the manuscript. As a complementary source, authors  should access online ifnromation on the APA manual at: <a href="http://www.apastyle.org/">http://www.apastyle.org/</a></p>

        <p><strong>Exception:</strong> If the abbreviated form results in identitcal  references to two papers with different co-authors, authors&rsquo; names are  mentioned to avoid any mix-up. Hayes, S. C., Brownstein, A. J., Hass, J. R.,  &amp; Greenway, D. E. (1986) and Hayes, S. C., Brownstein, A. J., Zettle, R.  D., Rosenfarb, I., &amp; Korn, Z.

      <p> The  paper uses a reference that discusses another reference, without having fully  read the original one (e.g. Flavell&rsquo;s study, cited by Shore, 1982). This kind  of citation should be avoided and limited to specific cases, which should be  informed and justified to the editor in a separate message. In the text, the  following citation format should be used:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> Flavell (as cited by, 1982) adds that those students&hellip;</p>

      <p><strong>Citation of re-edited century-old  publication</strong></p>
      <p> Author (date of original publication / date of  consulted edition), as in Franco (1790/1946).</p>
      <p><strong>Citation of private communication</strong></p>
      <p> This type of citation should be avoided, as it does  not provide information obtained through traditional methods. If unavoidable, it  can appear in the text, but not in the References.</p>

    <td width="70%"><p>References should be arranged  according to the following general rules. Papers by a single author and the  same authors are ordered per publication year, from older to newer  publications. Single-author precede multiple-author publications if the surname  is the same. Papers in which the first author is the same but the co-authors  differ are arranged by the co-authors surnames. Publications with the same  multiple authorship are arranged per date, from the older to the newer. Papers  with the same authorship and data are displayed alphabetically by the title,  ignoring the first word if that is an article or pronoun, except when the title  itself contains an indication of order; the year is immediately followed by  lower-case letters. When repeated, the author&rsquo;s name should not be replaced by  a hyphen or other signs. The formatting of the bibliographic list should be  appropriate for review and editing, with double lining and font 12. Each  reference should be placed in a new paragraph, <em>with an indentation of half centimeter from the  left margin on the second line</em>. Carefully check the  Publication Guidelines before preparing the references. The authors are fully  responsible for the exactness of references. Below are examples of common  reference types. </p>
