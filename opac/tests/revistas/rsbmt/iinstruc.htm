			<p>The <em>Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical</em> or <em>Journal of the Brazilian Society of Tropical Medicine</em> is a multidisciplinary and open-access journal that publishes original research in all fields of tropical medicine (including epidemiology, clinical studies, pathology, and immunology) and infectious diseases. It is the official journal of the Brazilian Society of Tropical Medicine. Review articles are invited, but the Journal also publishes major articles, short communications, case reports, editorials, letters, images in infectious diseases, technical reports, and special numbers (supplements). The Journal, published in English on a bimonthly basis, has a peer-review system. Its content is freely accessible to readers and no publication fees are charged to authors.</p>

			<p>From 2016 on, the <em>Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical</em> or <em>Journal of the Brazilian Society of Tropical Medicine</em> received financial support (public funding) solely from the National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&iacute;fico e Tecnol&oacute;gico, CNPq). This financial support was essential to ensure the Journal&rsquo;s quality, including improved impact factor, increased number of citations, XML generation, and review/editing of the English style and grammar issues of all accepted manuscripts, all of which have been paid by the Journal itself.</p>

			<p>Beginning in 2017, the Journal established that, when necessary, it will request authors to pay for the professional English review and editing service of a professional English editing company for the final version of their accepted articles.</p>

			<p>Submission to the <em>Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical </em>or<em> Journal of the Brazilian Society of Tropical Medicine</em> implies that the manuscript has not previously been published (except in abstract format) and that it is not being considered for publication elsewhere.</p>

			<p>Manuscripts submitted for publication in our journal are initially evaluated by the administrative staff to ensure compliance with Journal guidelines. Those manuscripts that meet the basic requirements will then be sent to at least two reviewers for evaluation through a peer review system. The Journal editors will use the reviewers&rsquo; detailed reports to decide whether to accept a submitted paper. If there is a difference of opinion among the reviewers, the manuscript will be sent to a third reviewer to validate a final editorial decision, in accordance with the submission workflow of the Journal (available online at <a href="http://www.scielo.br/revistas/rsbmt/iinstruc.htm#005">http://www.scielo.br/revistas/rsbmt/iinstruc.htm#005</a>).</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Poor English language use in manuscripts is the major cause of delay in publication. We strongly advise authors with English as a foreign language to have their manuscripts preferably translated and edited by a professional English translation and editing company or checked by a scientist with English as a first language; a copy of the certificate should be sent to the Journal.</p>

A total of five illustrations (tables and figures) are allowed.</p>

			<p><strong>Review Articles</strong>: Review articles should present a critical review of recent trends and progress in the study of infectious diseases, rather than a mere literature review, which are usually written at the direct request of the editor.

			<p><strong>Journal&rsquo;s review policy (workflow): </strong></p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>1 &ndash; All manuscripts submitted for publication in the Journal are initially evaluated by the Journal&rsquo;s administrative staff to ensure that the text adheres to the Journal&rsquo;s rules.</p>

			<p>2 &ndash; Manuscripts that meet the standards of the journal are evaluated by the Editor, Associate Editors, or Section Editors to determine whether they fit the scope and editorial policy of the Journal. The administrative staff then sends these manuscripts to the Editor-in-Chief.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>3 &ndash; The Editor-in-Chief (or Associate/Section Editors) assigns a manuscript to reviewers.</p>

			<p>4 - Each submitted paper is sent to at least two reviewers for a double-blind peer review culminating in an evaluation and comprehensive written report. The manuscript is also sent to reviewers specializing in quantitative methods for analysis. The Editors use these reports to decide whether to accept the paper. If there is a difference of opinion among the reviewers, the manuscript will be sent to a third reviewer to help reach a final decision by the Journal&rsquo;s editorial board.</p>

			<p>5 &ndash; Reviewer comments (Free Form Review) are forwarded to the corresponding author (principal contact for editorial correspondence); the corresponding author must answer any queries made.</p>

			<p>6 &ndash; The authors must respond to the queries and return a revised version of the manuscript. The revised version is sent back to reviewers, who provide a final, reasoned report on the manuscript.</p>

			<p>7 &ndash; Reviewers&rsquo; scores of the manuscript and the authors&rsquo; responses are analyzed by the Editor, Associate Editors, or Section Editors.</p>

			<p>8 &ndash; The Editor-in-Chief makes the final decision on accepting the manuscript for publication.</p>

			<p>9 &ndash; The final editorial decision (acceptance or rejection) is sent to the authors.</p>

			<p>10 &ndash; The editorial process begins after the manuscript&rsquo;s official acceptance. Accepted manuscripts are sent for English editing and a full review.</p>

			<p>11 &ndash; The English review results and edited document are sent to the authors for analysis; the authors must state whether they accept the edited version.</p>

			<p>12 &ndash; Next, the layout process begins. The Journal will communicate closely with the corresponding author regarding figures, tables, photographs, maps, illustrations, and the article&rsquo;s general format.</p>

			<p>13 &ndash; Authors must disclose any conflicts of interest or financial support and must provide a signed copyright assignment form.</p>
