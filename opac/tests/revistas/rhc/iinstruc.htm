      <p><b>Revista do Hospital das Cl&iacute;nicas</b> publishes peer - reviewed 
        materials of interest to clinicians and researchers in medicine. Authors 
        are invited to submit manuscripts featuring original experimental investigations, 
        clinical studies, reviews, case reports, technical notes and letters to 
        the Editors. </p>
      <p>Materials submitted to the Journal may not be under simultaneous consi-deration 
        by any other publication and should not have been published previously 
        in similar form. All authors must have contributed to the study and/or 
        manuscript because all are responsible for the contents. </p>
      <p>Studies involving experimental animals must conform to the guiding principles 
        of the Declaration of Helsinki, and human subjects must have given informed 
        con-sent to the study as approved by the Committee on Ethics and Research 
        at the author&#146;s institution. </p>
      <p>Authors will be required to sign a copyright transfer form that will 
        be sent with page proofs. Manuscripts will undergo blinded review by two 
        or more reviewers. Acceptance is based upon significance of the contribution 
        to medical science, originality, validity of the method and results, and 
        interest to readers. The Editor reserves the right to edit accepted manuscripts 
        prior to publication to comply with the journal&#146;s format, remove 
        redundancies, and aid clarity and understanding without altering the meaning; 
        edi-ted manuscripts will be sent to the authors for approval. Inquiries 
        and business correspondence may be directed to the Editorial Office at 
        the address below or by telephone: 55-11-3069-6235.<br>

      <p>All materials considered for publication should be sent to:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>Prof. Dr. Mauricio Rocha e Silva<br>
          </b>Editor, Revista do Hospital das Cl&iacute;nicas da FMUSP<br>
          Rua Dr. Ov&iacute;dio Pires de Campos, 225 - 6&ordm; Andar<br>
          CEP 05403-010 - S&atilde;o Paulo - SP        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>A submission letter, signed by all authors, must accompany each manuscript. 
        Any financial or other relations that could lead to a conflict of interest 
        must be disclosed in the letter of submission. If the Editor considers 
        this conflict of interest rele--vant to the paper, a footnote will be 
        added to show the equity interest in or affiliation with the identified 
        commercial firm(s).</p>
      <p>Manuscripts should be succint. The Introduction should be enough to update 
        the reader about the previous knowledge of the subject; omit well-known 
        and previously published material; quote them as references, if necessary. 
        Results may be pre-sented in the form of text or tables; avoid redundancy 
        of information in these two forms. Focus the Discussion on the work at 
        hand, including only those references that directly relate to the subject. 
        Use generic names of drugs instead of commercial names. Spell all abbreviations 
        at the first time they appear. Avoid using abbreviations in the abstract.</p>
      <p>Articles may be submitted in English or in Portuguese. If approved for 
        publication, the authors must provide a translation of the complete text 
        to English by their own means. Manuscripts submitted in Portuguese may 
        be significantly delayed in the editorial process. Material must be typed 
        on standard (letter size) white bond paper, double-spaced throughout.</p>
      <p>Articles must contain: title page (containing title only), one structured 
        summary in English and another in Portuguese (both containing title and 
        5 key words suitable for indexing), text, acknowledgments, references, 
        tables, legends and figures. Each of these sections must begin on a new 
        page. Because the manuscripts will undergo blinded review, no author or 
        institution name should appear in the text. In a separate sheet write 
        the title of the article, full names, highest aca-de-mic degree(s) and 
        affiliations for all authors and all sources of financial support. Three 
        hard copies of the manuscript (the original and two copies) and figures, 
        as well as a diskette containing the complete text in Rich Text Format 
        (.rtf) should be forwarded to the Editor. Summary may be up to 250 words, 
        indicating Purpose, Methods, Results and Conclusions whenever possible. 
        For case reports and technical notes, the abstract should be no longer 
        than 150 words.</p>
      <p>Organize your text into sections entitled Introduction, Method, Results 
        and Discussion. Case reports and technical notes shall be published as 
        letters to the editor and require only an introduction, a description 
        of the case/technique and a discussion. Cite references (in superscript), 
        tables and figures in order of appearance using Arabic numerals. Place 
        acknowledgments at the end of the text on a separate page.</p>
      <p>References - number in the order they appear in the text; unpublished 
        material or personal communications should be noted parenthetically in 
        the text. Use the Vancouver format for Journal articles. For more than 
        6 authors, use &#147;et al.&#148;. Write the title of the article in the 
        original language whenever possible. For book chapters, quote both the 
        author of the chapter and the editor of the book. Examples:</p>
      <p><b>Book:</b> <br>
        Turner WW, Valentine RJ, Wright CB. Acute vascular insufficiency due to 
        drug injection. In: Rutherford RB. Vascular Surgery. 4th ed. Philadelphia: 
        Saunders; 1995. p. 680.</p>
      <p><b>Journal article:</b> <br>

        de car&oacute;tida. Rev Hosp Cl&iacute;n Fac Med S Paulo 1997; 52(6):291-4.</p>
      <p>Submit tables and figures in separate sheets. Figures should be sent 
        in glossy print copies. Color reproductions, may be charged to the authors, 
        at the editor&#146;s discretion. Type legends for all illustrations on 
        a separate page, explaining all abbreviations and symbols used in the 
        illustration. Previously published figures must be accompanied by written 
        permission from the publishers to reproduce.<br>
