<p><b>Submission and  Publication Policy:</b> Manuscripts are considered for review only under the  conditions that they are not under consideration elsewhere and/or have not been  previously published, except in summaries with less than 400 words. The first  author of an approved article should forward to the address <a href="mailto:rbci@sbhci.org.br">rbci@sbhci.org.br</a>,  before publication, the Copyright Transfer Agreement Form (available in: <a href="http://www.rbci.org.br">www.rbci.org.br</a>),  duly signed by him/her and by the other authors. The approved manuscripts can  only be totally or partly reproduced with written consent of the editor of  RBCI.</p>
<p><b>Areas of interest for publication: </b>RBCI  is aimed at publishing manuscripts on percutaneous intervention in cardiac  (coronary and non-coronary), peripheral and cerebrovascular diseases.  Manuscripts exploring pharmacological, pathophysiological and diagnostic  aspects related to percutaneous intervention in cardiovascular diseases are  also considered for publication.</p>
<p><b>Types of articles:</b> Among the categories of articles accepted for publication are Original  Articles, Review Articles, Case Reports, Images in Cardiovascular Intervention,  Editorials and Letters to the Editor.</p>
<p><b>Reports of peer review  procedures of the journal:</b> All papers sent to RBCI are initially submitted to editor  assessment, that will decide if manuscripts will be sent further or not for  peer review among members of the Editorial Board or invited specialists. In  case of discrepancy between the reviewers, a new opinion may be requested for  better judgment. The authors have 30 days to implement changes requested by the  reviewers and resubmit the article. Non compliance with this deadline will mean  withdrawal of the article from the review process. The initial expert's report  is produced, whenever possible, within 4 weeks and the final expert's report in  up to 12 weeks, counting from the day it was received.</p>
    <b>Target public:  </b>Professionals with interest in percutaneous intervention in cardiovascular  diseases.</td>

It is understood that the first author is responsible for following the  instructions for submission, although the other authors should be informed  about these instructions, should have participated of the manuscript  preparation and should agree with its contents. Ahead are the specific  instructions for each article category accepted for publication.</p>
    <p><b>Original Articles</b></p>
    <p>In  this category are included randomized studies, observational studies,  registries, as well as basic research with animal experimentation.</p>

  - At the end of the Summary and Abstract, between three and five descriptors  should be indicated, in accordance with the language, Portuguese (DESCRITORES)  or English (KEY-WORDS), taken from Descritores em Ci&ecirc;ncias da Sa&uacute;de (Health  Sciences Descriptors, DeCS, prepared by BIREME, available in:  <a href="http://decs.bvs.br" target="_blank">http://decs.bvs.br</a>) and/or Medical Subject Headings (MeSH, prepared by the  National Library of Medicine/NLM, available in:  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh</a>).</p>
    <p>3) Text<br>
  - The body of the manuscript should be subdivided in the following sections:  "Background", "Methods", "Discussion", "Conclusions" and "Acknowledgments"  (optional).<br>
  - Figures, tables and references should be numbered in sequence, respecting the  order of citation in the text.<br>
  - Abbreviations may be used (6 maximum), since the respective complete forms  are present in the first instance they are mentioned.<br>

Persons mentioned should send a letter authorizing the  inclusion of their name in this section (because of eventual implication in  supporting data and conclusions). It is not necessary a written consent if the  acknowledgments are made to members of the working team.</p>
    <p>4) References<br>
  - References of printed and electronic documents should be made according to  the Vancouver style, prepared by the International Committee of Medical Journal  Editors (ICMJE), updated in 2009 (available in: <a href="http://www.icmje.org" target="_blank">http://www.icmje.org</a>).<br>
