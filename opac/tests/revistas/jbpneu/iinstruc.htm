      <p>The <b><i>Jornal Brasileiro de Pneumologia</i></b> (<b>J Bras Pneumol</b>, 
        Brazilian Journal of Pulmonology) <b>ISSN-1806-3713</b>, published monthly, 
        is the official organ of the Brazilian Society of Pulmonology and Phthisiology 
        for the publication of scientific papers regarding Pulmonology and related 
        areas. 
      <p>After being approved by the Editorial Board, all articles will be evaluated 
        by qualified reviewers, and anonymity will be preserved throughout the 
        review process.</p>
      <p>Articles that fail to present merit, have significant errors in methodology 
        or are not in accordance with the editorial policy of the journal will 
        be directly rejected by the Editorial Board, with no recourse. Articles 
        may be written in Portuguese, Spanish or English. As of volume 35, the 
        costs related to the editing and English translation of articles accepted 
        for publication will be borne, in part, by the authors. In addition, authors 
        electing to publish figures in color will be charged for that service. 
        For further clarification, please contact the Journal Secretary by e-mail 
        or by telephone.</p>
      <p>The <i>Jornal Brasileiro de Pneumologia</i> upholds the World Health 
        Organization (WHO) and International Committee of Medical Journal Editors 
        (ICMJE) policies regarding the registration of clinical trials, recognizing 
        the importance of these initiatives for the registration and international, 
        open-access dissemination of information on clinical trials. Therefore, 
        as of 2007, the Journal only accepts clinical trials that have been given 
        an identification number by one of the clinical trials registries meeting 
        the criteria established by the WHO and the ICMJE. This identification 
        number must be included at the end of the abstract. </p>
      <p>Within this context, the <i>Jornal Brasileiro de Pneumologia</i> adheres 
        to the definition of a clinical trial as described by the WHO, which can 
        be summarized as &quot;any study that prospectively assigns human beings 
        to be submitted to one or more interventions with the objective of evaluation 
        the effects that those interventions have on health-related outcomes. 
        Such interventions include the administration of drugs, cells and other 
        biological products, as well as surgical procedures, radiological techniques, 
        the use of devices, behavioral therapy, changes in treatment processes, 
        preventive care, etc.</p>
      <p>The Journal adopts iThenticate system for plagiarism identification.</p>
      <p>There are no fees for submission and review articles.</p></td>

      <p>An individual may be considered an author of an article submitted for 
        publication only if having made a significant intellectual contribution 
        to its execution. It is implicit that the author has participated in at 
        least one of the following phases: 1) conception and planning of the study, 
        as well as the interpretation of the findings; 2) writing or revision 
        of all preliminary drafts, or both, as well as the final revision; and 
        3) approval of the final version. 
      <p>Simple data collection or cataloging does not constitute authorship. 
        Likewise, authorship should not be conferred upon technicians performing 
        routine tasks, referring physicians, doctors who interpret routine exams 
        or department heads who are not directly involved in the research. The 
        contributions made by such individuals may be recognized in the acknowledgements.</p>
      <p>The accuracy of all concepts presented in the manuscript is the exclusive 
        responsibility of the authors. The number of authors should be limited 
        to six, although exceptions will be made for manuscripts that are considered 
        exceptionally complex. For manuscripts with more than six authors, a letter 
        should be sent to the Journal describing the participation of each.</p>

        The instructions for submission are available at: <a

        Although all manuscripts are submitted online, they must be accompanied 
        by a Copyright Transfer Statement and Conflict of Interest Statement signed 
        by all the authors based on the models available at: <a
href="http://www.jornaldepneumologia.com.br/" target="_blank">www.jornaldepneumologia.com.br</a>. 
      <p>It is requested that the authors strictly follow the editorial guidelines 
        of the journal, particularly those regarding the maximum number of words, 
        tables and figures permitted, as well as the rules for producing the bibliography. 
        Failure to comply with the author instructions will result in the manuscript 
        being returned to the authors so that the pertinent corrections can be 
        made before it is submitted to the reviewers. Special instructions apply 
        to the preparation of Special Supplements and Guidelines, and authors 
        should consult the instructions in advance by visiting the homepage of 
        the journal. </p>
      <p>The journal reserves the right to make stylistic, grammatical and other 
        alterations to the manuscript.</p>
      <p>With the exception of units of measure, abbreviations should be used 
        sparingly and should be limited only to those that are widely accepted. 
        These terms are defined in the List of Abbreviations and Acronyms accepted 
        without definition in the Journal. Click here (<u>List of Abbreviations 
        and Acronyms</u>). All other abbreviations should be defined at their 
        first use. For example, use &quot;C-reactive protein (CRP)&quot;, and 
        use &quot;CRP&quot; thereafter. After the definition of an abbreviation, 
        the full term should not appear again. Other than those accepted without 
        definition, abbreviations should not be used in titles, and their use 
        in the abstracts of manuscripts should be avoided if possible.</p>
      <p>Whenever the authors mention any substance or uncommon piece of equipment 
        they must include the catalogue model/number, name of manufacturer, city 
        and country of origin. For example: <br>
        &quot;. . . ergometric treadmill (model ESD-01; FUNBEC, S&atilde;o Paulo, 
        Brazil) . . .&quot;</p>
      <p>In the case of products from the USA or Canada, the name of the state 
        or province should also be cited. For example:<br>
        &quot;. . . guinea pig liver tTg (T5398; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) .
