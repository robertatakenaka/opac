      <p>The&nbsp;<em>Mem&oacute;rias  do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz</em>&nbsp;is a multidisciplinary journal which  publishes original research throughout the fields of tropical medicine  (including pathology, field epidemiology and clinical studies) medical and  veterinary parasitology (including protozoology, helminthology, entomology and  malacology), and medical microbiology (virology, bacteriology and mycology). It  particularly welcomes basic and applied research in biochemistry, immunology,  molecular and cell biology, physiology, pharmacology and genetics related to  these fields. Short communications are also considered. Review articles are  invited. The journal publishes eight issues constituting one volume per year.  Occasionally papers presented at symposia or congresses are published as  supplements.</p>
      <p>
        Submitted  papers must be written in English. English of low quality is a major cause of  delay in publication and we strongly advise authors with English as a foreign  language to have their manuscripts checked by someone with English as a first  language, preferably a scientist.</p>
      <p>
        Submission  of a paper to the&nbsp;<em>Mem&oacute;rias</em>&nbsp;is understood to imply that is has  not previously been published (except in an abstract form), and that it is not  being considered for publication elsewhere. Responsibility for the accuracy of  the material in the manuscript, including bibliographic citations, lies  entirely with the authors.</p>
      <p>
        Manuscripts  will be peer-reviewed; acceptance will be based on scientific content and  presentation of the material.</p>
      <p><b>Submission of manuscripts will only be accepted when submitted electronically using the following link:</b><b> <a href="http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/mioc-scielo" target="_blank">http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/mioc-scielo</a></b></p>
      <p>
        With this  service you can submit manuscripts, you will be able to check the content of  your submission, the electronic file will be used for editorial assessment and  online refereeing, and the editorial decision on the manuscript will be  communicated to you. </p>
    <p>By using this service you will guarantee fast  and safe submission of your manuscript, and speed the assessment process.</p>
    <p>The  Mem&oacute;rias' content is freely accessible to readers and no publication fees are  charged to authors.</p></td>

      <p><strong>Papers on development  of Natural Products and Pharmacological investigation paper must meet specifics  criterias. </strong></p>
    <p>We emphasize that  papers on development of Natural Products and Pharmacological Investigation  papers must meet the following specifics criteria:</p>
    <p>1 - Any  natural extract, fraction or compound should be fully characterized and information  provided regarding origin, localization and period of the year when it was  collected - specifically, the extract under study must have been fractionated  and the active substances within the natural product identified;</p>
    <p>
      2 -  Isolation or purification techniques must be described in detail;</p>
    <p>
      3 - Authors  must state in their paper that the material under study is endotoxin free;</p>
    <p>
      4 -  Cytotoxity assays with normal cells are required;</p>
    <p>
      5 - Plant  Material (as well as other organisms) must be properly identified. The  scientific name (in italic), the author of this name and the family must be  given; it should be mentioned who identified the material. The manuscript must  include references to voucher specimens of the plants (deposited in a major  regional herbarium) or the material examined;</p>
    <p>
      6 - Papers  dealing with the biological screening of series of uncharacterized extracts of  plants or other organisms will not be considered for publication in  &quot;Mem&oacute;rias&quot;;</p>
    <p>
      7 -  Pharmacological investigations of extracts require detailed extract  characterization. Chromatographic profiling (e.g., HPLC profile with at least  major peaks identified) should be carried out, or qualitative and quantitative  information on active or typical constituents should be provided;</p>
    <p>
      8 - Purely  descriptive articles will not be considered.&nbsp;<strong>Characterization of  mechanism(s) of action</strong>&nbsp;must be provided. &quot;Mem&oacute;rias&quot; only  considers manuscripts in which conclusions are based on adequate statistics. In  each case positive controls (reference compounds) should be used and the  dose/activity dependence should be shown;</p>
    <p>
      9 - Any  studies involving human subjects should have Ethic Institutional Review Board  Approval. Protocol number should be informed;</p>
    <p>
      10 - When  working with experimental animals, reference must be made to principles of  laboratory animal care or similar regulations and to approval by the local  ethical committee;</p>
    11 - Studies involving plants from the Brazilian  Biodiversity must have authorization for access to genetic resource and, if it  is the case, also for access to traditional knowledge associated. Authorization  number must be informed.</td>

   <p><strong>ILLUSTRATIONS</strong>   
   <p><strong>figures and tables</strong> must be understandable without reference to the text.<br>
     <strong>Figures:</strong> presented in tiff format with a minimum of 300 dpi and photographs must  be sharply focused, well contrasted, and if mounted onto a plate, the figures  should be numbered consecutively with Arabic numbers. Magnification must be  indicated by a line or bar in the figure, and referenced, if necessary in the  caption (e.g., bar = 1 mm). Plates and line figures should either fit one  column (8 cm) or the full width (16.5 cm) of the page and should be shorter  than the page length to allow inclusion of the legend. Letters and numbers on  figures should be of a legible size upon reduction or printing. A colour  photograph illustrates the cover of each issue of the Journal and authors are  invited to submit illustrations with legends from their manuscript for consideration  for the cover.
   <p><strong>Tables</strong> should supplement, not duplicate, the text and  should be numbered with Roman numerals. A short descriptive title should appear  above each table, with any explanations or footnotes (identified with a, b, c,  etc.) below.</p>
   <p><strong>OTHERS FORMAT STYLE OF ARTICLES</strong></p>
   <p><strong>Technical Notes</strong>: Technical Notes  should communicate rapidly single novel techniques or original technical  advances. The entire note should occupy no more than three printed pages  including figures and/or tables (it means around 10 double-spaced typed Word  file maximum). The text must not be not divided into sections. Therefore, the  state of art must be very briefly presented; results must be rapidly presented  and discussed at a time. Complementary tables and figures may be published as  supplementary data. References must be limited to few essential ones and cited  at the end of the note, using the same format as in full papers. A brief  summary and three key words must be provided. <br>
     <strong>Short communications</strong>: should  communicate rapidly single results or techniques. They should occupy no more  than three printed pages including figures and/or tables. They should not  contain excessive references. References should be cited at the end of the  paper using the same format as in full papers. A brief summary and three key  words must be provided. <br>
     <strong>Alternative format: </strong>manuscripts may be  submitted following the &quot;Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to  Biomedical Journals&quot; produced by the International Committee of Medical  Journal Editors also known as the Vancouver Style. In this case, authors should  follow the guidelines in the fifth edition (Annals of Internal Medicine 1997;  126: 36-47, or at the website&nbsp;<a href="http://www.acponline.org/journals/resource/unifreqr/htm" target="_blank">http://www.acponline.org/journals/resource/unifreqr/htm</a>) and will be responsible for modifying the manuscript  where it differs from the instructions given here, if the manuscript is  accepted for publication.&nbsp;Authors should also follow the Uniform  Requirements for any guidelines that are omitted in these Instructions. <br>
In case of  clinical trials, it&rsquo;s mandatory to inform the registration number of the REBEC  platform. <br>
A statement  that the data/results of the manuscript are not plagiarism and have not been  published elsewhere.</p>
   <p><strong>Once a paper is accepted for publication, the  authors must provide:</strong></p>
   <ol>
     <li>an <strong>affidavit</strong>, provided by the Editorial Office,  signed by all authors. Authors from different countries or institutions may  sign in different sheets containing the same basic statement;</li>
     <li>a <strong>copyright </strong>assignment form, provided by the  Editorial Office, signed by the corresponding author;</li>
     <li><strong>Page charges:&nbsp;</strong>there will be no page charges.</li>
<li><strong>Proofs: </strong>one set of page proofs will be supplied for the author  to check for typesetting accuracy, to be returned by the stipulated date. No  changes to the original manuscript will be allowed at this stage.</li>
