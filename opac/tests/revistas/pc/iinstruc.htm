      <p>The journal Psicologia Clínica is a biannual publication of original papers on Psychology.
      From 2013 on, we will accept submissions, not only in Portuguese, but also in English, Spanish and      French. Manuscripts submitted for publication in the journal Clinical  Psychology must be original, not under review by any other journal and must follow  the Standards Publication of the <i>Publication Manual of American  Psychological Association Manual</i> (2010, 6th edition).
<p><i>Psicologia Clínica</i> is a  publication of the Department of Psychology, Catholic University of Rio de  Janeiro. Having started in 1986, has been published biannually since 2001,  resulting in a modification and modernization of the older format, which were  intended to fit our publication editorial policy implemented by CAPES in  Brazil. The journal has international scope as authors, editorial board and  scientific council, specifying the affiliation of the authors, the editorial  board and the scientific council in all issues. Its target audience is  undergraduate and postgraduate students, as well as researchers and  practitioners of psychology and related fields. The articles published are  original, unpublished and produced from original research not published in  other journals.<br>
        The journal publishes theoretical  essays, literature review, results of empirical research, professional  experience reports and reviews of recent books, in addition to having  occasionally a special section in which are published interviews with renowned  researchers and / or translations of classical texts. Although the journal is  themed, we are gradually making room for editorial articles in areas adjacent  to clinical psychology, in an effort to consider the current trend of  diversifying and opening new frontiers for researchers and clinical  professionals.            
      <p><b>To submit of an article</b></p>
      <p>1. Original manuscripts should be submitted online at  <a href="http://submission.scielo.br/index.php/pc/index" target="_blank">http://submission.scielo.br/index.php/pc/index</a>. The identified sheet should be  uploaded as a supplementary document as the accompanying letter described  below.</p>
      <p> 2. All manuscripts must be accompanied by a letter signed by all authors (please upload as a supplementary document), certifying that the article does not hurt the ethical standards of the profession, giving the copyright to the journal Clinical Psychology, stating no potential conflict of interest related to the article and assuming full responsibility for their content.</p>
<p> 3. All authors must be registered in the system and the data entered  must be completed (name, affiliation, address, etc..).</p>
      <p> 4. Authors will be notified immediately on receipt of the manuscript by  the Editorial Board.</p>
      <p><b>To submit a book review</b></p>
      <p>1. The book review - of a book published not before the last two years -  shall be typed in double space, not exceeding 80 characters for line, of 2-6  pages.</p>
      <p> 2. The heading of the book review shall be in Portuguese, English and Spanish, and be followed by all the references of the book reviewed, including the number of pages.</p>
<p> 3. All authors must be registered in the system and the data entered  must be completed (name, affiliation, address, etc..).</p>
      <p> 4. In the case of citation, the norms of citations and bibliographical  references shall be the same used for articles.</p>
      <p><b>Our procedure when receiving  a manuscript </b></p>
      <p> Received manuscripts  are initially appreciated by the Editorial Board. If they are in accordance  with the Norms and they are considered as able to be published in Psicologia  Clínica, they shall be directed for Consultants ad hoc, who are chosen among  researchers of recognized competence in the field. The  consultants will not have access to the identification of the author, and  neither the authors of the consultants. After a blind analysis of the  manuscript, the ad hoc consultants recommend its acceptance for publication  (subject to any modifications to improve clarity or accuracy of the text) or  reject it. Authors will be notified of decisions throughout the process and  informed of the date on which the accepted papers will be published or of its  rejection. At each step, the authors receive unidentified copies of the  evalutaions made by the consultants. The Editorial Board reserves the right to  make minor modifications in the textes to expedite the process of submission or  publication of manuscripts.</p>
      <p><b>Reviewing the manuscript</b></p>
      <p> The authors of  manuscripts recommended for acceptance with modifications shall inform  reformulations, highlighting the passages modified in the text. If the authors  have decided not to perform some of the suggested modifications, they should  justify this decision, left to the discretion of the Editorial Board the final  decision on publication of the article. This letter (with the identification  subtracted) and the reworked manuscript will be sent back to referees for  review. If the reformulations are satisfactory, the article is approved.  Otherwise, the article may be rejected or further modifications may be  requested.</p></td>

Washington, DC. The  submissions that are not entirely in accordance with the rules will be filed  and the authors reported.</p>
    <p> Presentation of  manuscripts should follow the following order, on separate pages (use the tool  page break):</p>
    <p><b>I.<i> Title page with author names (upload as a supplementary document)</i></b><i></i></p>
    <p>      1. Title in Portuguese, English and Spanish, not exceeding 15 words;<br>
      2. Shorter running title not exceeding 5 words;<br>
      3. Name of each author with  institutional filiation (Department, Institution, City, State, Country);<br>

    <p><b>II.<i> Title page without author names (page 1)</i></b><i></i></p>
    <p>      1. Title in Portuguese, English and Spanish not exceeding 15 words;<br>
      2. Shorter running title not exceeding 5 words.</p>
    <p><b>III.<i> Abstracts (page  2)</i></b></p>
    <p>      1. Abstract in Portuguese (150-200  words long);<br>
      2. Keywords in Portuguese (minimum of three and  maximum of five);<br>
      3. Abstract in English (150-200)  words long);<br>
      4. Keywords in English (minimum of three and maximum  of five).<br>
      5. Abstract in Spanish (150-200) words long);<br>
      6. Keywords in Spanish (minimum of three and maximum of five).</p>
<p><b>IV.<i> Body of the article (page 3 and subs.)</i></b><i></i></p>
    <p>      This part of the manuscript should begin on a new page, numbered page  three (3), with the title centered on top of it. Each subsequent page should be  numbered. Do not start a new page for each subtitle. Separate them by using a  blank line. Only the first letter of the title / subtitle and the proper names  should be capitalized. In the case of items within the same subtitle, use the  italic format to identify it.</p>
    <p> In the case of research  reports, in addition to the title page and abstracts, manuscripts should be  arranged in the following order: Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion,  and References. If needed, other subtitles such as Conclusions or Final  Considerations can be added. In some cases, Results and Discussion can be  presented together, although this procedure is not recommended as a rule.<br>
      Footnotes should be  kept at a minimum. Indispensable footnotes should be identified in the text by  Arabic numbers, and appear after the References on a separate page under the  title &ldquo;Notes&rdquo;. The inclusion of figures and tables should be indicated in the  text, and presented in Annex.</p>
    <p> Citation rules should  be observed. Attribution to authors and indication of publication dates of all  cited works should be given. All author names should be followed by the year of  publication when their works are cited for the first time in each paragraph.  Literal excerpts of a text should be typed within double quotation marks, and  demand the citation of the page from which they were copied; in the case of  extensive citations, their left margin should be larger than the rest of the  text. All citations of citations should state their original references,  although this kind of citation should be avoided, especially when the original  can be easily accessed. However, if needed, author&rsquo;s last name of the original,  date, author&rsquo;s name of the citation and publication date should be stated. Do not use ibid., Idem, op. cit ..</p>
    <p><b>V.<i> References</i></b><i></i></p>
    <p>      Do not start a new page for the References section. Do not number  references. Use double space in this section also, do not leave extra space  between citations and do not use tabs before the author' names. References  should be listed alphabetically by author's last name. Each reference should  appear as a new paragraph (without tabs) and the surnames should be in lower  case (except the first letter).</p>
    <p><b>VI.<i> Annexes</i></b></p>
    <p>      Annexes should be  presented on new pages after the references. All pages should be consecutively  numbered, with double spacing. Annexes should be prepared if they are really  essential for the understanding of the text. Authors can choose to inform  readers through a note on what instruments or other material are available and  how to get them. All annexes should be indicated in the text, and identified  with capital letters (A, B, C, etc.). Figures and  tables should be presented along with their respective captions and titles,  each one on a new page. Figures and Tables should not exceed 11,5 x 17,5 cm.  The title of a table should appear at the top of it in lower case, and should  indicate its contents. The title of a figure should appear below it, and should  follow the same specifications for tables.</p>
    <p><b>VII. <i>Quotations and references in the body of the  manuscript</i></b><i></i></p>
    <p>      Quotations up to 40 words should come in the body text, with quotes and  no italics. Quotations over 40 words should come in a new paragraph, single  spaced, font size 11 and with a decrease of 3.75 from the left margin.</p>
    <p><b>1. Multiple authorship article</b></p>
    <p> a) Article with two authors: both author names should be cited every  time the article is mentioned;<br>
      b) Article with three to five authors: all authors should be cited in  the first time the article is mentioned; from second time on only the first  author surname should be cited, and followed by &ldquo;and cols.&rdquo; and by the date, if  it is the first citation in the paragraph;<br>
      c) Article with six or more authors: only the first author surname  should be cited, and followed by &ldquo;and cols.&rdquo; and by the date. However, in the  References section, all author names should be recorded.</p>
    <p><b>2. Old and re-edited works:</b></p>
    <p> The format that should be used is &ldquo;Author (publication date of the first  edition / publication date of the employed edition): page number&rdquo;. For example,  Freud (1912/1969, p.154). If there are other quotes or references to other  texts of the same publication, differentiate with lowercase letters. For  example, Freud (1939/1969a) and so on.</p>
    <p><b>3. Quotation of quotation:</b></p>
    <p> Refers to a  citation of a work mentioned by other publication which was actually used. For  example: &ldquo;Piaget (1932, cited by Flavell, 1996)...&rdquo;. In the References section  only the publication actually used should be recorded (in the case, Flavell,  1996).</p>
