      <p><strong>I &ndash; Editorial Line and Selection Criteria</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Psico-USF</strong> is a journal that aims at promoting the discussion  on scientific production in the field of Psychology, allowing it more visibility.  It is linked to the Graduate Program in Psychology at Universidade S&atilde;o  Francisco since 1996. The purpose of the journal is to serve as a forum for the  presentation and dissemination of current research in the field of Psychology  and as a vehicle for knowledge dissemination for researchers, professionals,  and others interested in the field. Manuscripts that report studies in fields related  to Psychology will be considered for publication, including basic,  experimental, applied, naturalistic, ethnographic, historical, and theoretical  processes, policies analysis, and systematic synthesis of research, among others.  Critical reviews of books, diagnostic instruments, and software will also be  considered. In view of establishing an interchange between peers and those  interested in Psychology, it has a blind peer review and it is published quarterly.  Therefore, the contents do not reflect the position, opinion, or philosophy of the  Graduate Program or those of the University. The journal&rsquo;s copyrights belong to  Universidade S&atilde;o Francisco, and copies are allowed only to authors for  reproduction of their own material, previously authorized by the journal&rsquo;s  editor-in-chief. Transcriptions and translations are allowed, provided that  they comply with the limit of 500 words and that the source is mentioned. Texts  are published in Portuguese, Spanish, and English.</p>
      <p>This is an open access journal, which means that all content is freely  available at no charge for the users or their institutions. Users are allowed  to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search or make available the link to  the full texts of this journal&rsquo;s articles without prior permission from the  publisher or author.&nbsp;This is in line with the definition of open access by  BOAI (Budapest Open Access Initiative).</p>
      <p><strong>II &ndash;  Description of the types of collaborations accepted by the journal Psico-USF</strong></p>
      <p>Original works  related to Psychology that fall into the following categories:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Research report: investigation  based on empirical data, using scientific methodology. Limited to 20-30 pages,  including <em>resumo </em>(abstract in Portuguese),  abstract, <em>resumen </em>(abstract in  Spanish), figures, tables, and references. Subtopics required: Introduction, Methods  (Participants, Instruments, Proceedings, Data analysis), Results, Discussion,  (or Results and Discussion, together) and Final Considerations (optional). In  the case of Results and Discussion as one section, Final Considerations are mandatory.&nbsp;It  is essential that the Methodology and the Data Analysis be based in current  strategies regarding the specificities of development in the area. In the Discussion,  it is essential that the results be broadly based on the literature retrieved  for composition of the Introduction. At least 50% of the references must be up  to date, that is, up to 5 years from the date of submission.</li>
      <li>Literature Review: minimally systematic review of the literature, whose product  is a critical assessment of the selected material. Authors are expected to: (a)  clearly define a problem; (b) summarize prior investigations to inform the  reader of the state of the research; (c) identify relations, contradictions, gaps  and/or inconsistencies in the literature; and (d) suggest further research  steps to solve the identified problems. It is essential that the manuscript include  Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion (in the case of Results and  Discussion as one section, Final Considerations are mandatory); the  restrictions proposed for the survey must be justified and cover at least 10 years,  cover at least three relevant databases in the research area and include the  English language. In addition, survey procedures must be detailed and  necessarily performed by at least two independent researchers. It is also  suggested that the manuscripts present the Flow Diagram, such as the one available  for download here: <a href="http://www.prisma-statement.org/PRISMAStatement/FlowDiagram.aspx">http://www.prisma-statement.org/PRISMAStatement/FlowDiagram.aspx</a>.</li>
      <li>Systematic Review (followed or not by meta-analysis): literature review  that follow scientific methods that explicitly aim to reduce biases,  synthetizing all relevant studies to respond a given question. In this case, elements  such as search strategies (in detail), eligibility criteria, data extraction  methods, tools and criteria for quality assessment of reports, risk of bias and  publication bias (the latter, in case of meta-analysis), should be present. Furthermore,  in the case of meta-analysis, the data analysis should be accurately described.  It is essential that the manuscript contain Introduction, Methods, Results and  Discussion (in the case of Results and Discussion as one section, Final  Considerations are mandatory).</li>
      <li>Technical note: description  of instruments and original research techniques. Limited to 5 pages.</li>
      <li>Review: critical  review of recently published work (up to 3 years), advising the reader regarding  its characteristics and potential uses. Limited to 5 pages.</li>

    <p><strong>III &ndash; Editorial Norms</strong></p>
    <p>The Publication Norms of <strong>Psico-USF</strong> are based on the Publication Manual of the American  Psychological Association - APA/ 6th edition (2010) regarding the organization  and presentation of the manuscript.</p>
    <p><strong>1. Selection of articles:</strong> the journal will  assess the manuscript that falls into the categories described above, according  to the initial analysis made by the editor. The analysis criteria refer to  originality, relevance of the theme, and quality of the scientific methodology,  as well as observation of the editorial standards adopted by the journal.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Unpublished work:</strong> Work submitted for publication at Psico-USF may  not have been previously published, nor be under consideration by another  journal. The manuscripts are subject to verification for plagiarism by a tool  for plagiarism detection and verification for fraudulent data. Such detection  will occur at the end of the editorial assessment process and, regardless of  the results indicated in the opinions, in case of plagiarism, the manuscript  will be immediately rejected and filed.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Authors:</strong> All authors must declare knowledge of the  content presented in the article as well as confirm its veracity and  substantial participation in the article writing process. Authors should make  themselves available to make corrections of possible errors verified during the  evaluation process of the submitted manuscript. The content and statements  contained in the manuscripts are the authors&rsquo; sole responsibility. Authors are  responsible for ensuring that there is no information in the article that can  identify them. Ethical procedures for research with humans must be respected,  including non-identification of research participants or institutions.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Peer review:</strong> Manuscripts submitted will be reviewed by the  Editorial Board, which may request review by members of the Advisory Board or <em>ad  hoc </em>reviewers, at their  discretion, provided that there is no conflict of interests on the part of the  reviewers. The review of the article is done with due respect for confidentiality,  preserving the author(s) and the <em>ad hoc </em>reviewers  identity. The opinions are objective, critical and constructive, aiming at  better qualifying scientific information. The author(s) will receive a summary  of the reviewers&rsquo; comments, which is the editor&rsquo;s responsibility. The article can  be accepted, accepted subject to changes, or rejected. In case of acceptance subject  to changes, authors will receive notification of the suggested changes and the reformulated  work must be sent online within the established deadline. The reformulated  article will be reassessed by one of the reviewers to define whether it has  complied with the feedback. In case of rejection with explicit justification, a  resubmission is encouraged based on the recommendations of the review.</p>
    <p><strong>5. </strong><strong>Editor:</strong> The editor declares  no conflict of interest on the published or rejected articles and is  responsible for the rejection or acceptance of articles. When some error is  found, he or she will promote publications for correction and retraction.</p>
    <p><strong>6. Editorial Board</strong>: The editorial board  is committed to following the ethical aspects of publication and in case of ethical  complaint, it is responsible for investigating ethical misconduct allegations  on matters related to the journal and for issuing retractions, corrections and  clarifications. It is also committed to keep academic records and data about authors  and reviewers and to investigate fraudulent or plagiarized content.</p>
    <p><strong>7. Copyrights:</strong> The copyrights of the published articles belong  to <strong>Psico-USF</strong>. The total reproduction of the articles in other  publications or for any other purpose requires written authorization from the  editor of Psico-USF. People interested in partially reproducing the articles  published in this journal (fragments no longer than 500 words, tables, figures  and other illustrations) must have written permission from the author(s).  Manuscripts submitted containing fragments of other publications must comply  with the limits specified to guarantee originality of the submitted work. It is  recommended that the authors avoid the reproduction of figures, tables and  drawings from other publications and, if not possible, the manuscript will only  be sent for analysis if accompanied by written authorization from the copyright  owner of the original work for reproduction in Psycho-USF. Under no circumstances  will Psico-USF or the authors cited in the works published in this journal transfer  the rights thus obtained.</p>
    <p><strong>8. Open access</strong>: all articles published  by Psico-USF are freely available to read, download and share on the website www.scielo.br/pusf.  We emphasize that no fee is charged for submission, processing, and publication of the  submitted manuscripts.</p>

    <ol>
    <li>The abstract in English must  follow the same specifications as the original abstract, followed by keywords, compatible with the keywords  in the original language.</li>
    <li>It is the journal&rsquo;s practice to make a final revision of the abstract, reserving the right to  correct it, if necessary. This is a very important item of the work, as, once  published, it will become available in all the indexers of the journal.</li>
    </ol>
    <strong><li>Sheet containing Resumen, in Spanish, compatible  with the original abstract</li></strong>
    <ol>
    <li>The <em>resumen</em> must follow the same specifications as the original  abstract, followed by <em>palavras-clave</em>, compatible with the keywords in  the original language.</li>
    <li>It is the journal&rsquo;s practice to make a final revision of the <em>resumen</em>,  reserving the right to correct it, if necessary. This is a very important item  of the work, as, once published, it will become available in all the indexers  of the journal.</li>
    </ol>
    <strong><li>Text Structure</li></strong>
    <ol>
    <li>There must be <em>Titles and subtitles</em> in all categories of original paper.  The text must have an organization of easy recognition, marked by a system of  titles and subtitles reflecting this organization. In case of research reports,  the text must present: Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion, as well  as Final Considerations, when necessary. Manuscripts in other editorial  categories must present titles and subtitles according to the case.</li>
    <li><em>Footnotes</em>. Should be avoided whenever possible. However, if  there is no other alternative, they should be indicated by Arabic numerals in  the text and inserted on the footer of the page on which they are indicated.</li>
    <li><em>Figures and Tables</em>. The location suggested for insertion of  figures and tables should be indicated in the text and they should be presented  after the References, one per page. The words <em>Figures</em> and <em>Tables</em>, throughout  the text, should always be written with the first letter capitalized and should  include their respective number. The standards do not include the words <em>Charts</em> or <em>Diagrams (Quadros ou Gr&aacute;ficos)</em>, only <em>Tables</em> and <em>Figures</em>.</li>
    <li><em>Citation of</em> <em>Authors</em>. Should  be made according to the APA standards, 6th. edition, as exemplified in Section  V. All names of the authors whose works are cited must be followed by the date  of publication, the first time they are cited in each paragraph. A full  transcription of a text must be enclosed by quotation marks, and the citation  of the author must be followed by the page number quoted. A direct quotation  with 40 or more words should be displayed in a freestanding block of text, starting  on a new line, with a margin of 5 spaces, as in a new paragraph. The font size  should be 12, as in the rest of the text. Do not use bold or italics in this  section. The highlights should be underlined.</li>
    <li><strong>Psico-USF</strong> recommends  that authors review their text, observing associations between the sections and  the subheadings used. Single-sentence paragraphs should be avoided. We emphasize  that the objective(s) of the study must be clearly explained. Only the sources  consulted and mentioned in the text should appear in the references section.</li>
    </ol>
    <li><strong>Appendices:</strong> The appendices should be presented on a new page, after the references,  and numbered consecutively. They should be indicated in the text, identified by  numbers (1, 2, 3, and so on) and appropriately titled. Use appendices if they are  really necessary for the understanding of the text.</li>
    <li><strong>Figures:</strong> They should be presented with their respective legends and captions, one  per page. Captions must be displayed below the figures, always in lowercase. To  ensure quality reproduction, figures containing drawings must be submitted in  photographic quality. Do not produce graphic figures with elaborate colors or  patterns that may be mistaken for each other when editing the journal. As the  published version cannot exceed the width of 8,3 cm for simple figures and 17.5  for complex figures, the author must make sure that the legends maintain visual  quality in case reduction is necessary.</li>
    <li><strong>Tables:</strong> They should preferably be rendered in MSWord and displayed in black and white.  Headings should be placed above tables and should indicate the content in no  more than 15 words. The first letter of each word in the headings should be capitalized  and followed by lowercase letters. Do not use capital, bold or italic letters inside  the table. The table should not exceed 17.5 cm wide and 23.5 cm long.</li>
    <li><strong>Notes on the authors:</strong> Include a brief description (approximately 60 words) on the authors&rsquo; current  activities and their background, including full postal and e-mail addresses of the  corresponding author.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>V &ndash; Reference List</strong></p>
    <p>Start the reference section on a new page. Double-space must be used with  no line spaces between entries. References should be listed in alphabetical  order, by the authors&rsquo; surname, which should not be replaced by en dashes or em  dashes. References should be arranged according to the guidelines established  by the Publication Manual of the American  Psychological Association - APA/ 6th edition (2010). The examples given  indicate how to organize the citations and references of the manuscript.</p>
