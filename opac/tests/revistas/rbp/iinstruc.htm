</p><p><ul><li><b>Original articles:</b> These should describe fully, but as concisely as possible, the results of original research, containing all the relevant information for those who wish to reproduce the research or assess the results and conclusions.</li><li><b>Review articles:</b> These should be systematic reviews and should include critical assessments of literature and data sources, critically reviewing and evaluating existing knowledge on a designated topic, in addition to commenting on studies by other authors. The search strategy and selection process should be described in detail, according to PRISMA or other appropriate guidelines.</li><li><b>Brief communications:</b> Original but shorter manuscripts addressing topics of interest in the field of psychiatry, with preliminary results or results of immediate relevance.</li><li><b>Special articles:</b> Special articles address specific current topics relevant to clinical practice and are less comprehensive than review articles. These should be non-systematic reviews and should include critical assessments of literature and data sources, critically reviewing and evaluating existing knowledge on a designated topic, in addition to commenting on studies by other authors.</li><li><b>Letters to the Editor:</b> Letters can contain reports of unusual cases, comments on relevant scientific topics, critiques of editorial policy, or opinions on the contents of the journal (maximum of four authors).</li><li><b>Editorials:</b> Critical and in-depth commentary invited by the Editors or written by a person with known expertise in the topic.</li></ul></p>
<p>Title: You can copy and paste this from your manuscript, but do not delete the title from the manuscript file. Make sure there are no line breaks in the title. Titles should be concise (max. 50 words), specific, and informative. Avoid using abbreviations.</p>
<p>Abstract: You can copy and paste this from your manuscript, but do not delete the abstract from the manuscript file. If submitting a structured abstract, add a line space between each section. </p>
<p><b>Step 2: Attributes</b></p>
<p>You will be asked to list 1 to 5 keywords that describe the main topics of your manuscript. Please use MeSH terms only.</p>
<p><b>Step 3: Authors & Institutions</b></p>
<p>List all authors by full name: First Name (Given) and Last Name (Family or Surname). You will also be asked to indicate authors' institutions and a valid e-mail address for each author. Note that all communications concerning manuscript submissions and authorship forms are done through email. Please also inform an ORCID account whenever possible. Review author list and confirm authorship order.</p>
<p>Postal/mail address and telephone number for the corresponding author should be included only in the title page (see below).</p>
<p><b>Step 4: Reviewers</b></p>
<p>You will be asked to indicate 5 potential reviewers for your manuscript. These should be researchers who have a publication record, clinical or research experience in the topic of your manuscript. Inform first and last name, e-mail address and institution. Suggested reviewers should not be from the same institution or research group from authors. Also, we advise against indicating collaborators from previous publications among suggested reviewers. Editors will consider your suggestions at their discretion. If you wish, you may also oppose specific reviewers for your manuscript.</p>
<p><b>Step 5: Details & Comments</b></p>
<p>Write a cover letter to the Editors explaining the nature of your article and why the authors believe the manuscript should be published by <em>Revista Brasileira de Psiquiatria (Brazilian Journal of Psychiatry)</em>. Make sure to mention whether the authors have published or submitted any related papers from the same study elsewhere. You may choose to upload a file or write the cover letter in the designated box.</p>

<p><b>Step 7: Review & Submit</b></p>
<p>Carefully review each step of your submission. The system will point with a red "X" whether there are any incomplete parts. Once you are ready, click on the "View Proof" buttons to view the individual and/or merged HTML and PDF files created, as well as the MEDLINE proof. You will be asked to review and approve the PDF of your article files to ensure that you are satisfied with how your manuscript is displayed for editors and reviewers. Confirm that your manuscript information is complete and correct any errors. When you are satisfied that the submission is complete, click the Submit button. We will not begin the editorial review process until this final step is completed.</p>

          <p><b>Title page:</b> Page 1 should contain full title, authors' names, their departments and institutions, including the city and country of origin. Please also include a running title with a maximum of 50 characters (letters and spaces). The full name, telephone number, fax number, e-mail address and full postal address of the corresponding author should be stated.</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Page 2 should present a structured abstract (not exceeding 200 words) with the following sections: Objective, Methods, Results, and Conclusion (check table with abstract requirements for each manuscript type, above). Please indicate three to five keywords in strict accordance with <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html">Medical Subject Headings</a>. Do not include an abstract in Portuguese or any language other than English. If applicable, inform the clinical trial registration number at the end of the abstract (see below).</p>
<p><b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> <em>Revista Brasileira de Psiquiatria (Brazilian Journal of Psychiatry)</em> supports the clinical trial registration policies of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the ICMJE, recognizing the importance of such initiatives for the registration and disclosure of trial results to the international community through open access. According to this recommendation and to the BIREME/OPAS/OMS guidelines for journals indexed in the LILACS and SciELO databases, <em>Revista Brasileira de Psiquiatria (Brazilian Journal of Psychiatry)</em> will only accept for publication clinical trials that have been registered in Clinical Trials Registries that meet the WHO and ICMJE requirements. </p>
<p><b>Main text:</b> The manuscript file (main text) must be written in English, double-spaced throughout, and should contain the following items in this order: <u>title page</u>, <u>abstract</u>, <u>manuscript text</u>, <u>acknowledgment section</u>, <u>references</u>, <u>figure legends</u>, and <u>tables</u>. Use 10-, 11-, or 12-point font size. All terms or abbreviations should be spelled out at first mention in the text and also in table/figure legends. All units should be metric. Avoid Roman numerals.</p>
<p><b>Reference list:</b> Authors are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of their references and for correct in-text citation. Number references in the order they appear in the text; do not alphabetize. In text, tables, and legends, identify references with superscript Arabic numerals. References cited only in tables or figure legends should be numbered in accordance with the first citation of the table/figure in the text.</p>
<p>Please observe the style of the examples below. To include manuscripts accepted, but not published, inform the abbreviated title of the journal followed by "Forthcoming" and the expected year of publication. Papers published electronically, but not yet in print, should be identified by their DOI number. Information from manuscripts not yet accepted should be cited only in the text as personal communication. Reference accuracy is the responsibility of the authors. Journal titles should be abbreviated in accordance with Index Medicus.</p>
<p>Examples:
<ul><li><b>Journal article:</b> Coelho FM, Pinheiro RT, Silva RA, Quevedo LA, Souza LD, Castelli RD, et al. Major depressive disorder during teenage pregnancy: socio-demographic, obstetric and psychosocial correlates. Rev Bras Psiquiatr. 2013;35:51-6.<br>

<p><b>Tables:</b> Tables should be submitted preferably in Word format, but Excel files are also accepted. If using Excel, do not place tables on individual spreadsheets within the same file because only the first sheet will be converted. Whenever possible, tables should be appended to the end of the manuscript text file (after any figure legends) instead of being uploaded as separate files. All figures/tables should clarify/complement rather than repeat the text; their number should be kept to a minimum. All illustrations should be submitted on separate pages, following the order in which they appear in the text and numbered consecutively using Arabic numerals. All tables and figures should include descriptive legends, and abbreviations should be defined. Any tables or figures extracted from previously published works should be accompanied by written permission for reproduction from the current copyright holder at the time of submission.</p>
<p><b>Figures:</b> Acceptable figure file formats are AI, BMP, DOC, EMF, EPS, JPG, PDF, PPT, PSD, TIF, WMF, and XLS. Figures can be included in the manuscript, but preferably should be uploaded as separate files. If your manuscript is accepted, you may be asked to provide high-resolution, uncompressed TIFF files.</p>
<p><b>Online-only supplementary material:</b> Online-only material should be submitted in a single Word document with pages numbered consecutively. Each element included in the online-only material should be cited in the text of the main manuscript (e.g., Table S1 available as online-only supplementary material) and numbered in order of citation in the text (eg, Table S1, Table S2, Figure S1, Figure S2, Supplementary Methods). The first page of the online-only document should list the number and title of each element included in the document.</p>

      <p>The manuscript submission and editorial review process is as follows:</p>
      <p>1.	An author submits a manuscript.<br>
2.	The manuscript is verified by the editorial office and assigned to an editor.<br>
3.	The editor reviews the manuscript and makes an initial decision based on manuscript quality and editorial priorities, usually either to send the manuscript to peer reviewers or to reject the manuscript at that point so that the author can submit it to another journal. The selection of manuscripts for publication is based on their originality, relevance of the topic, methodological quality, and compliance with these instructions.	<br>
4.	All manuscripts considered for publication are peer-reviewed by anonymous external referees. For those manuscripts sent to peer reviewers, the editor makes a decision based on editorial priorities, manuscript quality, reviewer recommendations, and perhaps discussion with fellow editors. At this point, the decision is usually to request a revised manuscript, reject the manuscript, or provisionally accept the manuscript.<br>
5.	The decision letter is sent to the author.
