    <td width="70%"><p>The IBRACON Structures and Materials Journal aims to  disseminate recent developments and advances in concrete structures and  materials, and promote the development of the construction industry through  joint collaboration of researchers, engineers, designers, builders,  manufacturers and users of concrete structures and materials. The main  objective is the publication of original contributions on scientific and  technological research, development and implementation of structural concrete.  This includes, among others, articles on standards, structural design, concrete  structures, composite structures, cement, cementitious materials and their  derivatives, such as concrete and mortar, reinforcing polymeric materials, and  asphalt used in construction. Fracture mechanics, aspects of durability,  structural properties, performance in situ, construction techniques and  structural behavior of materials when used in components and structures are  also in the scope of the Journal. Access to the Journal is free of charge for  authors and readers.</p></td>
