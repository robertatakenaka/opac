      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The journal aims mainly to publish researches 
        in the Agricultural, Food, and Biological Sciences fields and Agribusiness. 
        Papers in areas such as Exact, Earth, and other sciences are also welcome, 
        as long as they are closely related to the context of agriculture.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Each manuscript is initially reviewed by 
        the Editor, or Associate Editor, responsible for its respective field 
        of knowledge, who will send an e-mail to the correspondent authors, acknowledging 
        its receipt and generating a protocol number. This editorial review process 
        can only begin if the manuscript obeys all the established norms. Otherwise, 
        papers may be returned for corrections. So, in order to make the editorial 
        process work faster, it is recommended that authors pay close attention 
        to PAT's Instructions to Authors, before submitting their manuscripts. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Papers in accordance with the Instructions 
        to Authors section will be analyzed by the Editorial Board, which will 
        decide if the editorial process will continue or not. For that, the structure 
        of the work will be examined, as well as its degree of interest to potential 
        readers and the fields of knowledge it covers. Manuscripts that do not 
        adhere to its editorial policy will be returned to authors, even before 
        going through a technical-scientific analysis. Refused papers can be re-structured 
        and submitted again. For every paper returned, the Editorial Board will 
        justify exactly why it was not accepted. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Papers approved by the Editorial Board 
        will have their scientific value assessed by two or three peer reviewers 
        specialized in the subject, here named <em>ad hoc</em> consultants or 
        referees. Authors' identities will not be revealed to peer reviewers and 
        vice versa. These referees are chosen by the Editor or the Editorial Board, 
        among recognized researchers in the specific area of each paper, preferably 
        those not affiliated with the authors' institutions. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After analyzing the manuscript, each referee 
        can choose one of the following options: <em>i</em>) Recommended with 
        mandatory changes/corrections; <em>ii</em>) Recommended; or <em>iii</em>) 
        Not recommended. In his/her report, or in the manuscript itself, the reviewer 
        has total freedom to suggest changes, corrections, omit or add text and 
        sections, to point out ambiguous, redundant, incoherent descriptions, 
        inappropriate use of terminology or to request more detailed explanations. 
        The PAT Editorial Board always encourages its reviewers to provide constructive 
        criticism, concerning the analyzed papers. Thus, reviewers are requested 
        to maintain a respectful tone in their observations, criticisms, and suggestions. 
        They are also requested, with respect to authors and their unpublished 
        scientific discoveries, to give a feedback within four weeks, or other 
        deadline accorded with the Editors.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In order to preserve credibility and, at 
        the same time, avoid any embarrassment, the PAT Editorial Board requests 
        that referees, before beginning their analysis of a manuscript, consider 
        the possibility of a conflict of interest. This may include, for example, 
        a regular research collaboration with the possible authors (e.g.: publications), 
        an adviser/advisee relationship; a commercial interest in the publication; 
        family ties; involvement in the study; or any impediment to an unbiased 
        evaluation. In this case, the referee is requested to return the manuscript 
        to the Editor immediately, expressing the impossibility of analyzing it. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The text accepted by the Editorial Board 
        also goes through language proofreading, covering spelling, grammar, and 
        style. So, in order to make the editorial process proceed faster, it is 
        strongly recommended that the authors have their texts checked before 
        submission. A well-structured, harmonious, clear, concise, cohesive, precise, 
        impersonal, and stylistically correct text is part of what PAT and its 
        authors owe their readers and, above all, Science. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The decision of accepting or not a paper 
        for publishing is based, fundamentally, in the recommendations made by 
        the peer reviewer system. Complete copies of all reports, with the referees' 
        identities omitted, will be sent to the correspondent authors. The Editorial 
        Board understands that authors have the right to know how their paper 
        was welcome by the scientific community, even during the editorial process. 
        If the manuscript is submitted to only two referees, and one is favorable 
        to publish it, while the other is not, then a third reviewer is invited 
        to analyze it. If the majority of the reports are not favorable, the paper 
        will be returned to authors, and they are generally encouraged to submit 
        it again, in an improved version. However, before restarting the process, 
        it is recommended that authors make certain their papers will go through 
        a careful revision process, paying special attention to the editorial 
        and technical suggestions. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If there is a predominance of favorable 
        reports, the decision is for publishing the paper. However, that will 
        only happen provided the editorial or technical recommendations be accepted 
        or properly justified. A manuscript is rarely accepted without recommendations 
        for improvement. Thus, it is important to authors to understand that requests 
        for changes, nearly always, can improve the quality of their work, and 
        that this kind of request is usual in high quality periodicals. For that 
        reason, they should not take referees' comments, or even editors' corrections, 
        personally. But if they disagree with any of them, they should prepare 
        a written justification, scientifically based, to be sent to the Editor, 
        along with the revised version. That will happen within the deadline agreed 
        with the editors, that is, between thirty and sixty days, according to 
        the level of adjustments to be made. Otherwise, the paper will be discarded. 
        If there is any kind of justification, it will be analyzed by editors, 
        which may send them to the respective referees. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After the analysis of the revised version, 
        if the editorial and content suggestions have been properly incorporated 
        or contested, the paper is definitely accepted for publishing and enters 
        the editorial phase. Otherwise, it will be returned to authors for a new 
        revision. Once more, the PAT Editorial Board assures authors the right 
        to disagree with the suggestions presented. However, justifications without 
        a solid technical and scientific basis will be rejected. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the journal editorial process, the Editor 
        may carry out small changes in the authors' texts to speed up the publication 
        process. However, before making them available on-line, a copy is sent 
        to authors, for proofreading. In this phase, major changes can no longer 
        be incorporated. It is, thus, recommended that authors carefully read 
        their texts, highlighting errors and corrections to be made. This revision 
        must be completed and returned to the Editor, within five working days.

      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The journal publishes Scientific and Review 
        Articles related to the development of agriculture. The submission of 
        Research Notes is not accepted and Review Articles are only published 
        at the request of the Editorial Board.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Submissions are free of charge and made only on-line, through 
        the website <a

        All authors must register on the system and express, through the correspondent 
        author, their agreement concerning the submission, editorial policy, and 
        norms for publication in the PAT journal. For that, all authors must sign 
        a document which must be submitted as a supplementary file (.pdf version) 
        by the correspondent author (if authors live in different cities, more 
        than one document can be submitted as a supplementary file by the correspondent 
        author).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The PAT Journal recommends a maximum of 
        5 (five) authors per article. For more than that, a detailed description 
        of each author's contribution must be sent to the Editorial Board (remember 
        that, sometimes, the "Acknowledgements" section is more appropriate than 
        authorship).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While submitting a manuscript, the correspondent 
        author must also attest, in the name of all authors, the originality of 
        the paper, that it is not being submitted simultaneously to other periodicals, 
        and that they are in accordance with the format required for files, as 
        well as with the copyright policies which will be applied if the manuscript 
        is published. For researches dealing  directly with animals or human beings as their main focus, a previous approval  from an Ethics in Research Committee should be presented. For field  experiments, it is necessary to present data from a minimum of two production  cycles or two years of evaluation. Moreover, the author must enter the called metadata (information 
        about the authors and the paper, such as title, abstract, key-words - 
        in Portuguese and English), and transfer the files with the manuscript 
        and supplementary files.</font></p>
      <p>Manuscripts may be written in Portuguese or English, but will only be  published in English<font size="2" face="Verdana">.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Submissions may contain up to 18 pages. 
        The text must be written using Microsoft Word for Windows (maximum size 
        of 2MB, .doc version), A-4 paper size (210 x 297 mm), with 2.5 cm margins, 
        single column, double spaced. The font should be Times New Roman, 12 points. 
        Underlining and bold characters should be avoided, and all pages must 
        be numbered. Manuscripts submitted to PAT must also obey the following 
        specifications:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">1. Scientific Articles must be organized 
        in the following order: title (20 words maximum); abstract (up to 250 
        words); key-words (three words minimum, five words maximum, separated 
        by a semicolon); title, abstract, and key-words in Portuguese; Introduction; 
        Material and Methods; Results and Discussion; Conclusions; Acknowledgements 
        (if necessary, in a single paragraph); and References. Acknowledgements and information related to the 
        title of papers, as well as the authors' names, along with their respective 
        affiliation, address and e-mail address, detailed in numbered footnotes, 
        must only be inserted in the final corrected version of the manuscript, 
        after it is definitively accepted for publishing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">2. The citations must use the "author-year" 
        system. Only the first letter of the author's last name should be capitalized, 
        and the author and year are separated by a single empty space. E.g.: (Gravena 
        1984, Zucchi 1985). The "&amp;" symbol is used for two authors, and "et 
        al." for three or more. E.g.: (Gravena &amp; Zucchi 1987, Zucchi et al. 
        1988). If the author is mentioned directly in the text, just the year 
        comes inside parenthesis. Secondary citations should be avoided, as well 
        as the following sources:&nbsp; article in a preliminary version (in press 
        or preprint) or from a serial publication that is not peer-reviewed;&nbsp;summary 
        of a paper presented in a scientific event; oral communication; information 
        from poster sessions or panel discussions at a scientific event; private 
        communications of unpublished documents; e-mails; or private sites on 
        the Internet.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">3. References must be arranged by listing 
        authors' last name in alphabetical order, according to the NBR 6023:2002 
        norm, written by the Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Brasileira de Normas T&eacute;cnicas (ABNT). 
        Italics must be used to highlight titles and periodical titles cited in 
        full.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">4. Tables and figures must be identified 
        by Arabic numerals and always be referred in the text by these numbers. 
        Tables must be drawn in black and white, using single lines, 0.5 point 
        thickness (Microsoft Word for Windows standard), and their footnotes must 
        be numbered. Terms such as "the table above" or "the figure below" must 
        not be used. Figures should be presented with a minimum resolution of 
        300 dpi. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">5. The Board of Editors recommends that 
        authors always take a look at the articles recently published by PAT (<a
  href="http://www.agro.ufg.br/pat">www.agro.ufg.br/pat</a> or <a
  href="http://www.revistas.ufg.br/index.php/pat">www.revistas.ufg.br/index.php/pat</a>), 
        in order to solve doubts about these instructions.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">6. Authors will not be paid for published 
        articles and must waive their copyright in favor of the PAT journal. On 
        the other hand, authors are solely responsible for the content of those 
        articles, even if the Editor holds the right to adjust them to the norms 
        of the journal. Authors are allowed to publish their articles simultaneously 
        in their institutional repositories, as soon as the original publication 
        at the PAT journal is mentioned. </font></p>
