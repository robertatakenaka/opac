      <p><b>Psychology &amp; Neurosciences</b> is an Open Access, peer-reviewed, 

        online journal publishing articles encompassing all intersection areas 

        between psychology and neurosciences.The journal is organized into five 

        thematic sections:<br>

        <br>

        PLASTICITY AND NEURAL DEVELOPMENT<br>

        <br>

        Devoted to publish theoretical and experimental studies concerned with 

        neural mechanisms underlying adaptability, development and plasticity, 

        specially related to its implications to assay the bidirectional relationship 

        between brain and behavior.</p>

      <p>CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGY<br>

        <br>

        This section focuses on the relation between neurological and human cognitive, 

        emotional, and behavioral function, especially from studies employing 

        neuropsychological evaluation.<br>

        <br>

        NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY<br>

        <br>

        This section focuses on clinical, pre-clinical and basic pharmacological 

        studies in human and animal models to address physiological, molecular 

        and behavioral properties of psychotropic agents. Studies primarily employing 

        pharmacological agents as research tools to investigate psychological 

        processes and its neurobiological bases are also encouraged.<br>

        <br>

        BEHAVIOR / SYSTEMS / COGNITION<br>

        <br>

        The primary aim of this section is to publish advances in general topics 

        relating to learning, memory, emotion, cognition, and other psychological 

        systems.<br>

        <br>

        PSYCHOPHYSICS AND PERCEPTION<br>

        <br>

        This section covers studies in sensory processes, perception, attention, 

        and psychophysics. Description of methods, techniques, and instrumentation 

        of research in the field are also encouraged.<br>

        <br>

        Peer Review Process<br>

        <br>

        All published articles are peer reviewed. The editors-in-chief make an 

        initial appraisal of each manuscript. If the topic and treatment meet 

        the basic guidelines within the journal's scope, the manuscript is assigned 

        to one of the section editors according to the thematic sections. They 

        will oversee the review process with the help of associate editors, which 

        may be advised by independent expert reviewers. They will ask whether 

        the manuscript is scientifically sound and coherent, how interesting it 

        is and whether the quality of the writing is acceptable. The editorial 

        decision is generally made on the basis on the reviewers views. Slight 

        modifications in the text could be directly executed by the Editorial 

        Board. Once the review process has been completed, the associate editor 

        recommends acceptance, revision, or rejection of the manuscript. The ultimate 

        responsibility for editorial decisions lies with the editors-in-chief.</p>

      <p>General Information<br>

        <br>

        Manuscripts submitted to the journal involve the tacit assurance that 

        they have not been previously published and are not currently under consideration 

        elsewhere. Manuscripts containing parts of text extracted from other publications, 

        including figures, tables and drawings, should comply with the specified 

        limits to assure originality of the article. It is the author's responsibility 

        to obtain the corresponding written permission to use material in their 

        manuscripts that is protected by Copyright Law. The Journal is not responsible 

        for statements or copyright infringements made by contributors.<br>

        A copy of the manuscript and a covering letter stating the author's intent 

        to publish in the journal should be submitted via e-mail to editors-in-chief. 

        The submitting author takes responsibility for all information during 

        submission and peer review. Manuscripts submitted under multiple authorship 

        are reviewed on the understanding that all listed authors are in accordance 

        with the submission and that the final version of the manuscript has been 

        seen and approved by all co-authors. The receipt of manuscripts is acknowledged 

        via e-mail as soon as possible. It is very important to note that only 

        a formal acknowledgment from the editorial office officially establishes 

        the date of receipt.<br>

        <br>

        Language<br>

        <br>

        Manuscripts must be written in English. We ask that non-native English 

        speakers ensure their manuscripts be submitted in grammatically correct 

        form. Only manuscripts written in clear and understandable English will 

        be considered.<br>

        <br>

        Detailed Text Formating<br>

        <br>

        The text should be submitted in MS Word (.doc) format using 12-point Times 

        New Roman or Arial. All paragraphs should be justified at the left and 

        right edges in double-line spacing with 6-point spacing before and 6-point 

        spacing after. The pages should be letter-sized or A4, with top and bottom 

        margins of at least 2.5 cm, and left and right margins of at least 3 cm. 

        The manuscripts should not exceed the number of pages according to the 

        type of contribution (1-7).<br>

        <br>

        Citation Format<br>

        <br>

        This journal adopts the American Psychology Association (APA) citation 

        format. Please refer to the Publication Manual of the American Psychological 

        Association (APA, 5th edition, 2001). Additional information may be found 

        in the Manual and on the World Wide Web at APA Style at: <a href="http://www.apastyle.org/faqs.html" target="_blank">http://www.apastyle.org/faqs.html</a>. 

        The main point in the general guidelines is that the reference list and 

        text citations should agree and be accurate. All references cited in the 

        text must appear in the reference list, and all references listed in the 

        reference list must be cited in the text. <br>

        <br>

        Reference Citation in Text<br>

        <br>

        References should be cited in text by the last name of the author(s) followed 

        by the year of publication. These citations in the text usually appear 

        in parentheses, e.g. (Hobin, Ji, &amp; Maren, 2006) unless the author's 

        name is part of the sentence, e.g., &quot;as previously reported by Hobin, 

        Ji and Maren (2006)&quot;.<br>

        Note the use of and instead &amp; in this last example. If a parenthetical 

        citation includes two or more articles, separate them by a semicolon in 

        chronological order: (Fanselow &amp; Bolles, 1979; Bolles &amp; Fanselow, 

        1982; McNaughton &amp; Gray, 2000). When two or more articles by the same 

        author(s) are cited together, the author(s) is listed just once, with 

        the year of the articles following, separated by commas: (Graeff, 2003, 

        2004). To distinguish articles by the same author(s) published in the 

        same year, append a, b, c, etc., to the date: e.g., Kandel (2005a, 2005b).<br>

        <br>

        The following are representative examples of how to cite in the text according 

        to the number of authors:<br>

        <br>

        One Author<br>

        <br>

        Use the surname (without suffixes such as Jr.) and the year of publication 

        separated by a comma in parentheses. If you have just stated the author's 

        name in the text, put the year of publication only in parentheses: It 

        has been shown that...(Gibson, 2003) Gibson (2003) showed that...<br>

        <br>

        Two Authors<br>

        <br>

        For citing a work with two authors, always cite both author names every 

        time the reference appears in text:...as previously demonstrated (Adler 

        &amp; Schwartz, 2000)<br>

        <br>

        Three to Five Authors<br>

        <br>

        If there are fewer than six authors, cite all of them the first time and 

        subsequently use the first author's name followed by &quot;et al.&quot; 

        and the year of publication:<br>

        First Entry: Di Chiara, Loddo and Tanda (2000) describe an experimental 

        procedure...<br>

        ...as reported in rats (Di Chiara, Loddo, &amp; Tanda, 2000)<br>

        Subsequent Entries: Di Chiara et al. (2000) describe an experimental procedure...<br>

        ...as reported in rats (Di Chiara et al., 2000)<br>

        Note: All names should be listed in References.<br>

        <br>

        Six or More Authors<br>

        <br>

        For work with six or more authors, cite only the first author's last name 

        followed by &quot;et al.&quot; and the year of publication:<br>

        Ventura et al. (2005) reported ... <br>

        ...as reported in human (Ventura et al., 2005)<br>

        Note: All names should be listed in References.<br>

        <br>

        Work by Association and Corporation<br>

        <br>

        The names of groups that serve as authors (corporate authors): National 

        Institute of Mental Health [NIMH], 2005)<br>

        <br>

        Personal Communications<br>

        <br>

        Should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. They are referenced in 

        the body of the text only. Include the name, type of communication, and 

        date. Example of parenthetical citation in text: Fukushima (personal communication, 

        April 24, 2003) also found this...<br>

        <br>

        Article Reported in a Secondary Source<br>

        <br>

        Example: File (as cited by Rodgers, 2001) observed a similar profile.<br>

        Note: In References, list only the secondary source.<br>

        <br>

        Citation of Old Works Reissued<br>

        <br>

        Author (date of original publication/date of edition searched):<br>

        Darwin (1872/2000).<br>

        <br>

        Special Part of the Source<br>

        <br>

        If you are including a quotation or referring to a specific part of the 

        source, cite the year of publication and the page number: &quot;Likewise, 

        electroencephalograms and functional MRI scans capture correlates of the 

        mind but those correlates are note the mind&quot; (Damasio, 1999, p. 82).<br>

        <br>

        Reference List Format<br>

        <br>

        All sources cited in the main body of the text must appear in References. 

        They should follow the general principle of arranging them in alphabetical 

        order and chronological sequence. Enter the last name of the first author, 

        followed by the first author's initial(s), and so on for each additional 

        author. Multiple entries for same author or group of authors should be 

        ordered chronologically, and multiple entries for the same year should 

        be distinguished by appending sequential lowercase letters to the year. 

        The first line of each entry is flush with the left margin, and all subsequent 

        lines are indented (7 spaces) to form a &quot;hanging indent.&quot; <br>

        <br>

        The following examples offer basic guidelines according to different reference 

        sources:<br>

        <br>

        Journal Articles<br>

        <br>

        Must include the following elements: author(s), date of publication, article 

        title, journal title, volume number, issue number (if applicable), and 

        page numbers. Capitalize only the first word of the title or subtitle, 

        and any proper names that are part of a title. Use an ampersand (&amp;) 

        instead of the word &quot;and&quot; when listing multiple authors of a 

        single work.<br>
