      <p>The proposal of  Psicologia &amp; Sociedade is to publish  original articles on themes that privilege research psychology and society, aiming at the development of Social Psychology in a  critical,  transforming and  interdisciplinary perspective.  Psicologia &amp; Sociedade publishes a) research reports, b) theoretical  studies, c) critical literature reviews,  d) book reviews, e) interviews  and f) translations. In cases of actual comproved  academic and/or scientific innovationinnovations, reports of  professional experiences (description of procedures and strategies, or case  studies) and technical notes (description of instruments and original research  techniques) are also accepted.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation Process</strong><strong> </strong><br>
The manuscript  submitted to this journal cannot be simultaneously submitted or published  elsewhere. <br>
The evaluation process is  done in three (3) steps, as described below:</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>1st evaluation stage<br>
  </strong>After submitted the  manuscripts are evaluated for suitability to the standards specified herein (Instructions  for Authors). At this stage, all the items explicited for preparation of the  manuscript and its effective submission are checked, conducted by the General  Publisher and  the Editorial Assistants. Should  an error be found in the manuscript submission, authors will be notified and  will be given the opportunity to tailor  the manuscripts.<br>
  <strong>2nd evaluation stage<br>
</strong>At this stage, the  Editorial Board will assess the relevance of the manuscript to Social  Psychology, its adequacy to the scope and the overall quality of the text.</p>
<strong>3rd  evaluation stage<br>
</strong>At this stage, the  manuscripts are accompanied by the editors of Psychology &amp; Society, who are  responsible for appointing assessors. Submissions will be forwarded to peer review, preserving the identity  of  authors and  consultants (double blind review).
<p>The reviews issued by the consultants contain justifications  that may suggest the approval for publication without modification, the  approval for publication with recommended modifications or no recommendation to  the publication of the article. The final decision on the  manuscripts, after the appraisal of the reformulated text, rests with the  members of the Editorial Board, including the possibility of requiring further  modifications. The authors will be updated on all stages of the process. The  Editorial Board reserves the right to make slight changes to the authors' text  in order to make the publication process more agile. </p>
      <p>There is no charge for articles submission.</p></td>

    <p>The editorial process<strong> will only begin if the submission of the manuscript is in accordance with the  following conditions.</strong> If not so,  the manuscript will be sent back to the  author(s) so that it can be modified and become adequate according to the  journal  guidelines for publishing manuscripts.</p>
    <p>1) <strong>Psicologia  &amp; Sociedade</strong> adopts the <strong>American  Psychology Association style guidelines</strong>, with some adaptations. Please  refer to the &ldquo;Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (6th  edition, 2010)&rdquo;. Any omission of information in the detailed guidelines that  follow implies that the APA style orientations prevail.</p>
    <p>2) The manuscripts should be submitted using Word (<strong>.doc or .docx</strong>) format and <strong>should not</strong> exceed the maximum number of pages (start page numbering on the Abstract, which  will be given the number '1') indicated for each type of manuscript (including  Abstract, Figures, Tables, Appendixes and References, besides the text itself)  according to the type of manuscript:</p>
<p><u>Research  reports, theoretical studies and critical literature reviews</u> (15-25 pages): high  quality reports on original researches, based on complete and systematic  investigations, which propose an analysis of concepts, leading to questioning  existing models and to elaborating hypotheses for future researches. Articles   that propose a theoretical approach, or that contain a review based on a  critical and opportune analysis of a broad body of research related to issues  of interest to the development of Social Psychology, will also be accepted.</p>
    <p><u>Book  Reviews</u> (3-10 pages): a critical  review of books published in Brazil  (in the last two years) or abroad (in the last five years), offering the reader  information on its characteristics, uses and potential contributions to  Social Psychology.</p>
    <p><u>Interviews</u>(15-25 pages):  interviews with authors, authorities recognized in the academic area, and other  personalities who contribute to the debate in Social Psychology. Interviews  should contain the name(s) of the interviewee(s) and interviewer(s) and an  introduction of no more than one page. We kindly ask that the authors send us  the digitalized authorization for the publication of the interview signed by  the interviewee(s). </p>
    <p><u>Translations</u> (15-25 pages):  translations of articles, essays and relevant interviews that are not yet  available in Portuguese. The papers submitted should include a title, the  name(s) of the author(s) and the name(s) of the translator(s). A digitalized  copy of the original publication used in the translation should be attached to the article,  as well as a digitalized authorization for the publication of the translated  material (signed by the editor and/or by the author). </p>
    <p><u>Professional experience  reports</u> (10-15 pages): description of procedures and strategies, or case  studies that offer relevant academic contribution.</p>
    <p>3) It is fundamental that the material<strong>does not contain any form of authorship identification</strong>, including reference to prior work of the author(s),  details about the method that may enable the  identification/localization or its origins, as well as information  related to &lsquo;Document Properties&rsquo;. </p>
    <p>Information  about previous works or methodological details that can be identified must be  concealed; instead, one can use the terms &quot;University XXX,&quot;  &quot;School XXX&quot;.<br>
      <br>
Multiple quotes  of yourself should be avoided. If unavoidable, the word &quot;Author (year of  publication)&quot; should be used in the text and in the top of the References  list &ndash; instead of being included in the alphabetical sequence &ndash; you must append  the following information: &quot;Author (year of publication) &ndash; include  reference after peer review&quot;.<br>
<br>
The ways to  remove the identification of authorship in the file properties may vary  depending on the version of Word or another text editor. On the help tool of your  text editor, search for &quot;Properties&quot; or &quot;Inspect Document&quot;  and follow the instructions to remove personal information from the document. </p>
    <p>      Author (s) that had his/her submissions accepted for  publishing will have the opportunity to include furthermore information during  the review process.</p>
<p>4) The metadata of the submission must be filled in a  correctly and complete way.</p>
    <p>5) Original manuscripts should be submitted by the author(s)  through the internet <em>SciELO Submission</em> system. </p></td>

    <td width="70%"><p><strong>1) Format guidelines</strong></p>
      <p>- The  manuscript should, be an A4 format document with  its pages numbered from the Abstract (page 1) to the References, including Tables,  Figures and Appendixes.</p>
      <p>- Font:  Times New Roman, size 12, <u>from  the beginning to the end of the manuscript</u>, including References,  Footnotes, Tables, and so forth.</p>
      <p>- Margins:  2.5 cm on all sides (top, bottom, left and right).</p>
      <p>- Spacing: <strong>double-spacing</strong> <u>throughout the manuscript</u>, including the  Title Page, Abstract, Text, References, Appendixes, and so forth.</p>
      <p>- Alignment:  left.</p>
      <p>- Indentation  of the first line of each paragraph: tab = 1.25 cm.</p>
      <p>- Page  number: top right corner at the height of the first line of each page.</p>
      <p>- Internet  addresses: all the URL addresses (internet links) that appear in the text (<a href="http://pkp.sfu.ca">http://pkp.sfu.ca</a> for example) should be activated and must guide to the  cited document.</p>
      <p>- Images must present  high quality - minimum resolution of 300 dpi, jpeg format </p>
<p><strong>2) Order of manuscript  parts</strong></p>
<p>The elements of the manuscript must be presented in  the following order: a)  un-identified title page, b)  abstract, c) main  body of text, d) notes,  e) references, f) list of acknowledgements and  funding agencies, along with the process number and (or) the Notice by which the  support was obtained and g) appendixes, tables and figures. </p>
<p><strong>A.</strong><strong><u> Un-identified Title Page</u></strong>: the Cover Sheet is not counted in the total  number of pages, but it should be integrated in the same file of the other text  elements. It should contain the <u>original title</u> (maximum 14 words) and <u>compatible titles</u> in Spanish  and English. Headings  and subheadings should not contain period.</p>
<p><strong>B. <u>Resumo, Resumen and Abstract</u>: </strong>abstracts: in Portuguese, Spanish and  English should be formatted in single paragraphs , with a<strong> maximum  of 150 words</strong> and having &ldquo;Abstract&rdquo; as the title in the first  line before the text, left-aligned. At the end  of each abstract,choose three to five keywords (in lowercaseand separated by semicolons). We suggest that the<strong> </strong>keywords used be drawn from the  terminology in Psychology BVSPsi or Thesaurus of Psycinfo.<strong></strong></p>
<p>As a standard procedure, Psicologia &amp; Sociedade  reviews the final version of the abstract written in English, reserving the  right to correct it, if necessary. This is an important item of your work,  because in case your work is published, the abstract will be available in all  the indexing databases of the journal. The abstract is not required  for the submission of book reviews, interviews or technical notes.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong><strong><u> Main body of text</u></strong>: the title of  the manuscript is not required on this section. Each subsection of the main  body of the text <strong>does not</strong> start on a new page and its  heading must be centered and have only the first letter of each word  capitalized (for example, Results, Method, Discussion, etc). The <strong>subheadings</strong> of the subsections must be in italics and the  first letter of each word capitalized (for instance, the subheadings of the  subsection Method: Participants or Data Analysis). Titles and subheadings must  not be punctuated in the end. In case of subdivisions in the text, it is  recommended to use a  maximum of three levels of intertitles, listed with numbers or letters.</p>
<p>The first letter of the words<strong> Figure,  Table, Appendix</strong> should be capitalized when written in the main body  of the text and followed by the number (for Figures and Tables) or letter (for  Appendixes) of the respectiveelement they are referring  to. The place suggested for inserting Figures and Tables should be indicated in  the text.</p>
<p><u>Underline</u>, <em>Italics</em> and <strong>bold</strong> typefaces: avoid  underlining. Use italics or underline words or expressions that should be  emphasized in the printed text, for instance, foreign words/phrases of the  English language such as <em>locus</em>, and  other words that you may want to stress. <strong>Bold</strong> typefaces should  be used only for  titles.</p>
<p><strong>Latin abbreviations:</strong> Use the following standard abbreviations in <strong>Latin only in texts put between parenthesis</strong>;  for other situations, use the English translation of the Latin terms: cf. =  compare; i.e. = that is; e.g. = for example; viz. = namely; etc. = and so  forth; vs. = versus, against. </p>
<p>C.1 <em>Citations</em></p>
<p>Always acknowledge the authors and include the date of  publication of the studies referred to in the article. All the authors&rsquo; names  whose works are cited should be followed by the publication date. All studies  cited in the text should be listed in the References section or in the Notes if unpublished.</p>
<p>In the case of  direct quotation, the page where the passage can be found in the work consulted  must also be informed. Direct quotes must be accurate, even if there are errors  in the original. If this happens and there is risk of confusing the reader, add  the word [sic], underlined and in square brackets immediately after the error.  Omission of excerpts from an original source must be indicated by ellipsis  without parentheses. The inclusion of material such as comments or observations  must be made between brackets. The emphasis in one or more words should be done  with underlined font, followed by [emphasis added]. </p>
<p><strong>Examples of citations in  the body of the manuscript</strong>:<br>
  <br>
      The examples below can help you organize your manuscript,  but certainly do not  cover all the possibilities of citation in your work. Use  the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (2010, 6th  edition) to verify the rules referent to other types of citation.</p>
      <p>C. 1.1 <em>Citation  of a works developed by multiple authors</em><br>
        <br>
      a) Work by two authors: cite both names every time the  reference occurs in text: ... Walker  and Fleck (2000) compared the social context.</p>
      <p>b) Work by three to five authors: cite all authors the first  time the reference occurs; in subsequent citations, include only the surname of  the first author followed by et al. and the year of the publication, in case it  is the first citation of the reference within a paragraph (do not italicize &ldquo;et  al.&rdquo; Remember to add a period after &quot;al&quot;). After the first  citation in a paragraph, the year may be omitted:<br>
        Wasserstein, Zappulla and Rosen (1994) found [first citation  in the text]<br>
        Wasserstein et al. (1994) found [first citation within a  paragraph]<br>
        Wasserstein et al. found [subsequent citation within the  same paragraph]</p>
      <p>c) Work by six or more authors: cite only the surname of the  first author followed by et al. and the year. However, in the References  section provide the initials and surnames of all of the authors.</p>
      <p>C.1.2. <em>Citations of  Historical or Re-edited Works</em></p>

        Use the following format: author (original date of  publication / date of publication consulted)<br>
        James (1890/1983)
      <p>C.1.3. <em>Paraphrasing or  referring to an idea contained in another work</em></p>

        It refers to citing an idea which is developed in an article   mentioned in the material consulted, without having had access to the  original text that contains the idea cited, for example, &quot;Piaget (1932,  cited by Flavell, 1996) studied...&quot;. In the list of References cite only the  work directly consulted (in this case, Flavell, 1996). 
        <p>NOTE: Incorporate quotations of <strong>less than 40 words</strong> in  text, and delimit the quotation with quotation marks.<br>
        <br>
Display a quotation of  <strong>40 or more words</strong> in a freestanding block of typewritten lines, and omit the  quotation marks. Start each of these blocks with a new line, and indent the  block 1.25 cm  from the left margin. <br>
<br>
        To introduce quotations <strong>of more than 500 words</strong> or reproduce  one or more figures, tables or other illustrations a written permission from  the copyright owner must be obtained. The permission must be addressed to the  author of the manuscript. Under no circumstances will the permissions obtained  secondarily be passed on.</p>
      <p><strong>Latin abbreviations</strong>: Use the following  standard abbreviations in Latin only in texts put between parenthesis; for  other situations, use the English translation of the Latin terms: cf. =  compare; i.e. = that is; e.g. = for example; viz. = namely; etc. = and so  forth; vs. = versus, against.</p>
      <p>Caution: Do not  use the terms apud, op. cit, id. ibidem and others. They are not part of the  APA norms. </p>
      <strong>D. <u>Notes</u></strong>:Avoid them as much as  possible. However, if there is no other alternative, they should be indicated  by using superscript arabic numerals in text and presented immediately after  the Main Body of Text. The title (Footnotes) must be centered on the first line  below the Page Header. Indent the first line of each footnote in 1.25 cm and number them  according to the respective indications in the text.
      <p><strong>E. <u>References</u>:</strong>        Start the References section on a new page, with the heading  &ldquo;References&rdquo; centered on the first line below the Page Header. Only the works  consulted and mentioned in the text must appear in this section. Continue to  use double-spacing and do not leave extra space between the citations. Works  should be listed alphabetically by the author's surname, according to the APA  style (see some example below). Use the Publication Manual of the American  Psychological Association (2010, 6th edition) to verify the norms not mentioned  here.</p>
      <p>In the case of references to <u>multiple works by the same  author</u>, use chronological order, namely, from the earlier works to the most  recent works of the author. The name of the authors should not be substituted  by dashes.</p>
      <p>Articles  presented in congress or contribution to a symposium <u>but  not published</u> should not appear in the References, just like Notes.</p>
