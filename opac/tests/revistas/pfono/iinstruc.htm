      <p>Pr&oacute;-Fono Revista de Atualiza&ccedil;&atilde;o Cient&iacute;fica 
        publishes preferably original research articles that contribute significantly 
        for the growth of knowledge in the field of the Speech, Language and Hearing 
        Science. Other categories accepted for publication are: Reviews and Systematic 
        Reviews, Case Reports, Book Reviews, Commentaries, Letters to the Editor, 
        Research Letters, Clinical Reminders, Fillers/Special Sections, Conference 
        Reports, Websites. <br>
        All of the material submitted to the Journal will be reviewed by the Editorial 
        Board.</p>
      <p>Peer review process</p>
      <p>Manuscripts should be submitted on line (www.revistaprofono.com.br) and 
        should be written in either Portuguese or English. The first analyses 
        will be done with the text in Portuguese (if the manuscript was submitted 
        in this language). If the text is approved by our reviewers and selected 
        for publication, it should be translated into English (responsibility 
        of the authors), having the maximum of 15 days to hand in the text. The 
        translated version will be reviewed by a translator named by Pr&oacute;-Fono. 
        If this version is accepted, the final version of the text will be submitted 
        to our International Editorial Board. The accepted manuscripts will be 
        published in two versions: in Portuguese as the printed version and in 
        English as the electronic version (<a href="http://www.revistaprofono.com.br/" target="_blank">www.revistaprofono.com.br</a>). 
      </p>
      <p>After the initial technical and scientific assessment, done by a technical 
        reviewer and by the Editor, and after the necessary reformulations made 
        by the authors, manuscripts will be submitted to a peer review (Associate 
        Editor, Advisory Reviewers in the specific field of knowledge, National 
        and International Advisory Reviewers of other fields of knowledge), using 
        the double blind system. Reviews will be sent to the authors within 90 
        days. Reformulations suggested by the reviewers can be accepted or contested, 
        in which case the author can appeal in writing. The reformulated version 
        will be published according to the chronological order of the finally 
        approved documents. The authors will be then informed of the probable 
        date of publication, when the dates of arrival, reformulations and final 
        approval will be registered. Authors are responsible for the origin and 
        authenticity of their work, including the use of illustrations, names, 
        people, history, text citations, references etc. Authors compromise themselves 
        to reveal any personal, commercial, political, academic or financial conflicts 
        of interest.</p>

        whenever necessary, without changing the content of the article in order 
        to improve the presentation. Terms are standardized according to Stedman

      <p>Research Papers: should include a structured abstract (Background, Aim, 
        Method, Results, Conclusion) with a maximum of 250 words. Full text should 
        contain a maximum of 2500 words; a maximum of 30 references (exclusively 
        of nationally and internationally indexed journals, 50% preferably indexed 
        in ISI); three tables or figures. For these manuscripts (of a quantitative 
        or qualitative nature), introduction should have no more than a page and 
        must be entailed to the exact content of the study. The emphases of the 
        manuscript should be on the methodology and results, with clear and well 
        determined statistical descriptions and analyses (for qualitative studies). 
        Only the necessary figures will be accepted, those which replicate data 
        already presented in statistical tables will not be accepted. Discussion 
        and Conclusion should be resumed and exclusively based on the results 
        of the study. Sections of this type of manuscript: Introduction, Method, 
        Results, Discussion, Conclusion, References. </p>
      <p>Reviews and Systematic Reviews: we are particularly interested in reviews 
        of any whole field or aspect of the Speech-Language and Hearing Sciences 
        that is of relevance to our readership. These should be authoritative 
        and identify any gaps in our knowledge or understanding. Systematic Reviews 
        must contain a brief section entitled “Search strategy and selection criteria”. 
        This should state clearly: the sources (databases, journal or book reference 
        list, etc) of the material covered, and the criteria used to include or 
        exclude studies – for example, all that was published in a certain journal 
        in the last three, four or five years. Maximum of 3000 words, maximum 
        of 30 references (exclusively of nationally and internationally indexed 
        journals, 50% preferably indexed in ISI); structured abstract with 250 
        words (Background, Aim, Conclusion), maximum of 4 tables or figures. Sections 
        of this type of manuscript: Introduction, Conclusion, References.</p>
      <p>Case Reports: clinically interesting cases should be written in a maximum

        journals, 50% preferably indexed in ISI). Case reports should be of conditions 
        that provide new insight, describe rare but modifiable disorders or present 
        new treatments and understanding. Sections of this type of manuscript: 
        Introduction, Method, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, References.</p>
      <p>Book Reviews: we encourage reviews of international books which have 
        been published in the last three years. The original should be completely 
        cited, in its original language (author(s), title, edition, publishing 
        company, city of publishing company, year, number of pages). Maximum of 
        1500 words. </p>
      <p>Commentary: commentaries include debate articles, long comments or personal 
        observations on current research or trends in the field of the Speech-Language 
        and Hearing Sciences that is likely to be of interest to our readers.

        of already concluded parts of a larger research project (e.g. a pilot 
        study). Research Letters should contain no more than two tables or figures, 
        a maximum of 1500 words and a maximum of 30 references (exclusively of 
        nationally and internationally indexed journals, 50% preferably indexed 
        in ISI). These letters do not include an abstract. Authors of full articles 
        may be invited to re-submit a shorter version of their manuscript for 
        publication in this section. </p>
      <p>Clinical Reminders: very short and simple resumes of Case Reports that

        Maximum of 900 words.</p>

        essence of papers presented by our researchers in international conferences 
        (unpublished in Brazil). The original paper should be entirely cited in 
        its original language (author(s), title, conference were the work was 
        presented, city, country). Maximum of 1000 words. </p>
