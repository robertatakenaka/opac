    <td width="70%"><p>International  Archives of Otorhinolaryngology (IAORL) is an international peer-reviewed  journal dedicated to otolaryngology&ndash;head and neck surgery, audiology, and speech  therapy.</p>
      <p> IAORL is published  every three months and supports the World Health Organization (WHO) and of the  International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) politics regarding  registration of clinical trials. Therefore from now on we will only accept for  publication articles of clinical trials that have been given a number of  identification from one of the Clinical Essay Registry validated by the  criteria established by the WHO and the ICMJE, the links to which are available  at the ICMJE (<a href="http://www.icmje.org/" target="_blank">http://www.icmje.org/</a>). The identification number should be given  at the end of the abstract.</p>
      <p> IAORL reserves the  right to exclusive publication of all accepted manuscripts. We will not  consider any manuscript previously published nor under review by another publication.  Once accepted for review, the manuscript must not be submitted elsewhere.  Transfer of copyright to IAORL is a prerequisite of publication. All authors  must sign a copyright transfer form.</p>
      <p> Authors must  disclose any financial relationship(s) at the time of submission, and any  disclosures must be updated by the authors prior to publication. Information  that could be perceived as potential conflict(s) of interest must be stated. This  information includes, but is not limited to, grants or funding, employment,  affiliations, patents, inventions, honoraria, consultancies, royalties, stock  options/ownership, or expert testimony.</p>
      <p><strong>Article Categories</strong><br>
        The journal  publishes the types of articles defined below. When submitting your manuscript,  please follow the instructions relevant to the applicable article category.</p>
      <p><strong>Original Research</strong><br>
        Original, in-depth,  clinical or basic science investigations that aim to change clinical practice  or the understanding of a disease process. Article types include, but are not  limited to, clinical trials, before-and-after studies, cohort studies, case control  studies, cross-sectional surveys, and diagnostic test assessments. Components  of original research are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>A title page</em>, including the manuscript title and all  authors&rsquo; full names, academic degrees (no more than three), institutional  affiliations, and locations. Designate one author as the corresponding author.  Also indicate where the paper was presented, if applicable. </li>
        <li><em>A structured abstract </em>of up to 250 words with the headings: Introduction,  Objective, Methods, Results, and Conclusion. </li>
        <li><em>The Manuscript body </em>should be divided as: introduction with  objective(s); method; result; discussion; conclusion; references.</li>
        <li>Manuscript length of no more than 24 pages  (exclusive of the title page and abstract).</li>
        <li>Studies involving human beings and animals  should include the approval protocol number of the respective Ethics Committee  on Research of the institution from which the research is affiliated.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Systematic Reviews (including Meta-analyses)</strong><br>
        Critical assessments  of literature and data sources on important clinical topics in  otolaryngology-head and neck surgery. Systematic reviews that reduce bias with  explicit procedures to select, appraise, and analyze studies are highly preferred  over traditional narrative reviews. The review may include a meta-analysis, or  statistical synthesis of data from separate, but similar, studies leading to a  quantitative summary of the pooled results. The components of a systematic  review are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>A title page</em>, including the manuscript title and all  authors&rsquo; full names, academic degrees, institutional affiliations, and locations.  Designate one author as the corresponding author. Also indicate where the paper  was presented, if applicable.</li>
        <li><em>A structured abstract </em>of up to 250 words with the headings: Introduction,  Objectives, Data Synthesis, and Conclusion.</li>
        <li><em>The Manuscript body </em>should be divided as: introduction; review  of literature; discussion; final comments; references.</li>
        <li><em>Manuscript length </em>of no more than 24 pages (exclusive of the  title page and abstract).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Case Reports</strong><br>
        Case Reports will no  longer be accepted for submission, starting on 2015. Submitted manuscripts  until December 2014 will be reviewed and published, if approved. </p>
      <p><strong>Update Manuscripts</strong><br>
        The manuscript is an  update that explores a particular subject, developed from current data, based  on recently published works.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>A title page</em>, including the manuscript title and all  authors&rsquo; full names, academic degrees, institutional affiliations, and  locations. Designate one author as the corresponding author. Also indicate  where the paper was presented, if applicable.</li>
        <li><em>A structured abstract </em>of up to 250 words with the headings:  Introduction, Objectives, Data Synthesis, and Conclusion.</li>
        <li><em>The Manuscript body </em>should be divided as: introduction; review  of a particular subject; discussion; final comments; references.</li>
        <li><em>Manuscript length </em>of no more than 15 pages (exclusive of the  title page and abstract).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Letters to the Editor and Opinion articles</strong><br>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="15%"></td>
    <td width="70%"><p>All manuscripts should be submitted at <a href="http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/iaorl" target="_blank">http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/iaorl</a>, which  gives access to the ScholarOne Manuscripts submission system where the submission  of the article is done by the authors and the evaluation process is done by the  reviewers of our editorial board in a blinded process where the names of the  authors are not displayed in any instance. The system will ask for your user ID  and password if you have already registered. If you have not registered, click  on the link &ldquo;Create Account&rdquo; and make your registration. In case you have  forgotten your password, click on the appropriate link and the system will generate  an automatic e-mail with the information.
      <p>The author(s) should keep a copy of all submitted  material for publication because the editor cannot be held responsible for any  lost material. <br>
        After submission, the system offers the option of  saving a copy of your manuscript in PDF format for your control.</p>
      <p> The journal strongly recommends that the authors  submit their electronic manuscripts written in Microsoft Word. In the  &ldquo;Preparing Manuscript&rdquo; step a screen that simulates the word processor will be  displayed, where it is possible to &ldquo;copy and paste&rdquo;, including tables.</p>
      <p><strong>Mandatory Author Forms</strong><br>
        Ethics and Financial Disclosure: The manuscript  will be assigned to an Editor for solicitation of peer review and editorial  evaluation ONLY after this form has been submitted by the corresponding author.</p>
      <p><strong>Patient Confidentiality</strong><br>
        For manuscripts containing photographs of a person,  submit a written release from the person or guardian, or submit a photograph  that will not reveal the person&rsquo;s identity (eye covers are inadequate to  protect patient identity). </p>
      <p><strong>Using Previously Published Material and Illustrations</strong><br>
        For manuscripts containing illustrations and/or  material reproduced from another source, permission from the copyright holder,  medical illustrator, or original publication source must be obtained and submitted  to the editorial office.</p>
      <p><strong>IRB Policy and Animal Studies</strong><br>
        For all manuscripts reporting data from studies  involving human participants, formal review and approval, or formal review and  waiver (exemption), by an appropriate institutional review board (IRB) or  ethics committee is required and should be described in the Methods section with  the full name of the reviewing entity. All clinical research requires formal  review, including case reports, case series, medical record reviews, and other  observational studies. For experiments involving animals, state the animal handling  protocol in the Methods section, including approval by an institutional board.</p>
      <p><strong>Duplicate or Redundant Submission</strong><br>
        Manuscripts are considered with the understanding  that they have not been published previously and are not under consideration by  another publication. If the author explicitly wishes the journal to consider  duplicate publication, he or she must submit the request, in writing, to the  Editor with appropriate justification.</p>
      <p><strong>Deadlines</strong><br>
        Submissions not in compliance with the following instructions  will be returned to the author by the editorial office and a corrected version  must be resubmitted within 30 days. Papers not resubmitted within that time  will be withdrawn from consideration. </p>
      <p> Revised manuscripts must follow the same  instructions and should be submitted within 30 days of the revision letter date.</p>
      <p> Accepted manuscripts sent to the publisher will be  typeset and proofs will then be sent by e-mail to the corresponding author. If  proofs are not approved and received within 2 business days, the article will  not be published.</p>
      <p> The reviewers should send their comments within 20  days.</p>
      <p><strong>English Language Assistance</strong><br>
      Appropriate use of the English language is a  requirement for publication in IAORL. Authors who wish to improve the grammar  and spelling in their articles may wish to consult a professional service. Many  companies provide substantive editing via the web. A few examples are:</p>
      <p>        <a href="http://www.journalexperts.com" target="_blank">www.journalexperts.com</a> <br>
        <a href="http://www.editage.com" target="_blank">www.editage.com</a> </p>
      Please  note that IAORL has no affiliation with these companies and use of the service  does not guarantee your manuscript will be accepted</td>
