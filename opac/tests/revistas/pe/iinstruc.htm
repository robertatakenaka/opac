      <p>To ensure that the text editorial process to be submitted&nbsp; can be &nbsp;fast and efficient, it is important&nbsp; that, before being sent to the Journal, some  steps are observed by the authors:</p>

      <ul type="disc">

        <li>Carefully review with the Standards of the       journal. From the correction of the mother tongue or another language to       the items that should compose your correspondece for submission. (see <a href="#ch">checklist</a>)</li>

      </ul>

      <ul type="disc">

        <li>Ask a peer to assess your text before you       actually submit it to the journal.</li>

        <li>Strictly follow the steps below in detail to       ensure a good&nbsp; work presentation. </li>

      </ul>

<p>All manuscripts undergo a preliminary review by the Executive Team and Advisory board to determine whether or not  they are suitable for publication. Those considered suitable are sent out to ad  hoc scientific reviewers. This stage  of&nbsp; the publishing process&nbsp; covers the preliminary assessment of the  article and then, the evaluation by consultants. </p>
<p>The Journal does not charge any submission or evaluation fee.</p>
<p>Reviewer's o pinions hold three possibilities: a) accepted in full; b)  accepted with changes; c) rejected.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Authors will be notified in any of these cases. (see flowchart) </p>

<p>To make the publication effective, it is necessary that all the changes  accomplished by the author(s), be discriminated and informed &nbsp;via online to the Scientific Editor of this  journal. After we receive the  redrafted articles by the authors , it&nbsp;  is forwarded to the evaluation of these reformulations, which is the  last stage of the process of article analysis as to its&nbsp; scientific merit. See flowchart.</p>

<p>The language revision can be made by the Executive Team and Advisory  board. When they consider it is essential&nbsp; substantial changes that may  alter the author's idea, the author will be notified and entrusted of doing  them, returning the work reformulated in the maximum period determined by the  editor. </p>

<p>The evaluation process uses the blind review system, preserving the  authors' identity and consultants.</p>

<p>Editorial  Board and executive team reserves the right to final decision about to publish  or not the manuscript.</p>

<p> All the editorial process can be followed  by the authors by electronic system with your login  and password.</p>

<p>Note:&nbsp; Only the cover sheet is not counted in the  total pages of&nbsp; the article. </p>

<p>Common types of citations </p>

<p>Authors &nbsp;citations &nbsp;should follow APA norms. Observe carefully the  citations norms. Always give credit  to authors and the dates of publication of all studies reported. All the  authors&rsquo;s names, whose works are cited,  should be followed by the date of publication, by the first time they are cited  in each paragraph.&nbsp;&nbsp; In case  of full transcription of a text of less than 40 words should be indicated by  quotation marks followed by&nbsp; page number  in parentheses. The punctuation  goes before the closing with quotes.&nbsp; Literal excerpts of 40 or more words should be presented in a block  typed&nbsp; without italics and quotation  marks, but double space, starting in a new line. An indent  should be  used at left margin, as a new paragraph.</p>

<p>A direct  citation&nbsp; should be accurate, even if  there are errors in the original text. If that happens and can occur&nbsp; the risk of confusing the reader, add the  word [sic], underlining &nbsp;and putting &nbsp;into &nbsp;brackets, just after the error. &nbsp;The  omission of part of the text from an original&nbsp;  source must be indicated by three dots (...). The inclusion of material,  such as comments or observations, should be bracketed. &nbsp;The emphasis on one or more words should be  underlined,&nbsp; followed by [our emphasis].</p>

<p>All secondary citations must inform the original reference. Avoid using  them , specially when the author can be recovered at ease.But, if it&nbsp; is essential, please: author&rsquo;s surname ,  date, author&rsquo;s name&nbsp; who made the  original quote and the date of publication of the study.</p>

<p>A  testimony or interviews citations from&nbsp;  subjects of research&nbsp; are inserted  in the body of the paragraph (less than 40 words),&nbsp; in italics and quotation marks. 40 words or  more must be in indent&nbsp; as bibliographic  citations, but in italics.</p>

<p>Before  submitting the paper, prepared according to the previous instructions, the  authors should read it again carefully and draw attention to the folowing  items: a correspondence between sections and used subtitles, works cited in the  text and listed in the references. Paragraphs of a single&nbsp; sentence must be avoided because the text  fragment.&nbsp; Objectives of the study should  be clear and explained at the beginning of the text (referring to the  literature review and the methodology). All cited authors should be listed in the  References section. Only the works which were consulted&nbsp; and&nbsp;  mentioned in the text should appear in that section.</p>

<p><em>Citation of an only  author</em></p>

<p>1. Literal citation:<br>

  The author&acute;s surname should appear in all citations, indicating year and page  of publication, according to the following example:<br>

  Eg:&quot;Although it is part of nature, from it man is distinguished by its own  laws and to map out its own destiny&quot; (Boarini, 2000, p. 6). </p>

<p>Eg: According to Boarini (2000) &quot;Although it is part of nature,  from it man is distinguished by its own laws and to map out its own  destiny&quot; (p. 6).</p>

<p>2. Conceptual citation:<br>

  The authors surnames &nbsp;should appear in  all citations, indicating only year of publication, according to the following  example:<br>

  Yamamoto (1996), entende que o per&iacute;odo entre os anos 1973-74, no Brasil,  registra um momento importante na altera&ccedil;&atilde;o de rumo da pol&iacute;tica... [author&acute;s  name should be stated, omitting the year of publication, in subsequent  citations within same paragraph]</p>

<p>Note: No matter the number of authors of the work, when a literal  citation should appear, it must include names(s) of author(s), year and page of  publication.</p>

<p><em>Citation of  multiple authors</em></p>

<p>1. Article with two authors<br>

  Surnames in a citation of multiple authors should be linked with the word  &quot;e&quot;. In presentation among parenthesis, in tables and titles of  figures, and on the references, names should be linked with &quot;&amp;&quot;.</p>

<p>Eg (authors as part of the text): To Klein and Linhares (2007) the  characteristics of the severity of neonatal health are related to&nbsp; analysis of the trajectories of the  development of premature infants.</p>

<p>Eg (authors who are not part of the text). The characteristics of the  severity of neonatal health are related to analysis of the trajectories of the  development of premature infants (Klein &amp; Linhares, 2007</p>

<p>2.  Article with three to five authors</p>

<p>In  the first time the article is mentioned, all authors surnames &nbsp;should be cited. From second time on only the  first author surname should be cited, and followed by &quot;and cols.&quot; And  by the year.</p>

<p>Eg (authors as part of the text): Environmental factors for Silva, Santos and Gon&ccedil;alves  (2006) may give different formats or shape aspects of motor behavior in  the&nbsp; infant&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p>Eg (authors who are not in the text): Environmental factors may&nbsp; give&nbsp;  different formats or shape aspects of motor behavior in the infant's  life (Silva Santos, &amp; Gill, 2006).</p>

<p>From the second time there is the quote: Silva et al. (2006) claim that  (...).</p>

<p>3. Article with six or more authors<br>

  Only the first author surname should be cited, and followed by &quot;and  cols.&quot;, and by the date, unless. However, in the References section, all  authors &nbsp;names should be stated.</p>

<p>In the References section, whatever the number of authors, all should be  listed</p>

<p><em>Citation of  citation</em></p>

<p>1. This refers to a citation of a work mentioned by other publication  which was actually used without previous reading. (e.g. a study of Flavell,  cited by Shore, 1982) It should be stated like: &quot;Flavell (cited by Shore,  1082) adds that....&quot; In the references section only the publication  actually used should be recorded (in the case Shore, 1982), using the  appropriate format.</p>

<p><em>Citation of old and  re-edited works</em></p>

<p>It should be used the &nbsp;following  format:<br>

  Author (publication date of the first edition / publication date of the  employed edition). Ex.: Franco (1790/1946).</p>

<p><em>Orientations about References</em></p>

<p>First of all start &nbsp;a new page to the References Section. Use  simple space in this section&nbsp; and double  space to separate them. The references should be cited in alphabetical  order&nbsp; using the author&rsquo;s surname. In  case of multiple studies by&nbsp; the same  author, use a cronological order, that is, from the earlier study to the most  recent one. Authors names should not be replaced by indents or dashes.</p>

<p>The second line of each reference should be indented  by 5 spaces  (in Word, format paragraph with a displacement of 0.68 cm). Review the standards of the journal carefully before preparing your  list. Note that the authors&rsquo;s &nbsp;surnames &nbsp;are placed only with the first letter in  uppercase.</p>
