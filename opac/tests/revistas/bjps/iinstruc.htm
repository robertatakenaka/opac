      <p>Manuscripts that do not  agree to the Instructions will be refused prior to peer review. <br>
Manuscripts must be  submitted in English.</p>
      <p> Submission of a manuscript  to BJPS implies that the data have not been published previously and will not  be submitted for publication elsewhere while the manuscript is under review.</p>
      <p> Co-authors should be  individuals who have contributed substantially to the content of the paper. <br>
        Manuscripts in accordance  to the “Preparing your manuscript section” will be submitted for peer review to  at least two independent, anonymous referees indicated by the Associated  Editors. Based on peer review, the Associate Editors will suggest manuscript  acceptance or not to the Editor-in-Chief, who is responsible for the final  decision.</p>
      <p> In the case revision is  suggested, the authors are asked to resubmit the manuscript incorporating the  suggestions and recommendations of the referees within 15 calendar days. If the  revised version is not received within the time specified from the date of notice,  the manuscript process will be canceled. All revisions must be accompanied with  a letter detailing the changes made to the original document and answering all  the reviewer comments, on a point-by-point basis. All alterations must be  identified in the revised manuscript.</p>
      <p> Manuscripts must have their  copyright assigned to the BJPS before submitting to the Journal.<br>
        The dates of receipt and  acceptance will be published for each article. Authors are expected to return  reviewed manuscripts to the Journal within 15 calendar days, and to return  galley proofs of accepted manuscripts within 72 hours. The total number of  &quot;late&quot; days will be added to the submission date at the time of  publication.<strong></strong></p>
      <p>        Authors are required to  suggest 4 potential reviewers with information of institutional and e-mail  address. At least 2 of the potential reviewers suggested should be from a  different country to the corresponding authors. The Editors reserve the right  to indicate these or other reviewers for manuscript evaluation.</p>
      <p><strong>Manuscript categories</strong><br>
        The  authors should state in the cover letter that the manuscript is intended to be  Full-length Original Paper, Short Communication, Review Article, Mini-review  article, Concepts and Comments and Book Reviews.<br>

      <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
        Since abstracts are published separately by Information Services, they should  contain sufficient hard data to be appreciated by the reader. The abstract  should not exceed 250 words and should be prepared in a single paragraph.<br>
        The abstract should briefly  and clearly present the objective, experimental approach, new results as  quantitative data if possible, and conclusions. It should mention the  techniques used without going into methodological detail and mention the most  important results.<br>
        Abbreviations should be  kept to a minimum and should be defined in both the Abstract and text. Please  do not include any reference citations in the abstract. If the use of a  reference is unavoidable, the full citation should be given within the  abstract.</p>
      <p>  <strong>Key Words</strong><br>
        A list of key words or  indexing terms (no more than 6) should be included avoiding generic terms.</p>
      <p>  <strong>Running title</strong> <br>
        This short title, to be  used as a page heading, should not exceed 60 letters and spaces.</p>
      <p><strong>Corresponding author</strong> <br>
      One of the authors should  be designated as the corresponding author. It is the corresponding author´s responsibility  to ensure that the author list is accurate and complete. If the article has  been submitted on behalf of a consortium, all consortium members and  affiliations should be listed in the Acknowledgments section. Provide the name  and email address of the author to whom correspondence should be sent  identified with an asterisk.</p>
      <p>  <strong>Introduction&nbsp;</strong><br>
        The Introduction should put the focus of the manuscript into a broader context  and reflects the present state-of-art of the subject. This should state briefly and clearly the  objectives of the investigation with reference to previous works. Extensive  review of the literature should be avoided and substituted for references of  recent review publications.</p>
      <p><strong>Material and Methods </strong><br>
        These should be described in sufficient detail  that the work can be reproduced. Well-established procedures and techniques require  only a citation of the original source, except when they are substantially  modified. Reports of experimental studies on humans and animals must certify  that the research received prior approval by the appropriate institutional  review Ethics Committee.</p>
      <p>  <strong>Results and Discussion:&nbsp;</strong>Results must be presented clearly and concisely  and in logical order. This section should provide  results of all of experiments required to support the conclusions of the paper.  When possible, use  figures or tables to present data rather than text. Large  datasets, including raw data, should be submitted as supplementary files; these  are published online linked to the article.<strong> </strong>Discussion should  interpret the results and assess their significance in relation to existing  knowledge. Speculation not warranted by actual data should be avoided. The  Discussion should spell out the major conclusions and interpretations of the  work including some explanation of the significance of these conclusions.</p>
      <p>  <strong>Acknowledgments&nbsp;</strong><br>
        When appropriate, briefly acknowledge technical assistance, advice and  contributions from colleagues. People who contributed to the work but do not  fit the criteria for authors should be listed in the Acknowledgments section,  along with their contributions. Donations of animals, cells, or reagents should  also be acknowledged. You must also ensure that anyone named in the  Acknowledgments agrees to being so named. Financial support for the research  and fellowships should be acknowledged in this section (agency and grant  number).</p>
      <p>  <strong>Figures</strong><br>
      Figures must be submitted in high-resolution version (600 dpi).</p>
      <p>        <strong>Preparing figure files for  submission</strong><br>
        <em>BJPS</em> encourages  authors to use figures where this will increase the clarity of an article. The  use of color figures in articles is free of charge. The following guidelines  must be observed when preparing figures. Failure to do so is likely to delay  acceptance and publication of the article.<strong></strong></p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Each figure of a manuscript should be       submitted as a single file.</li>
        <li>Figures should be numbered in the order       they are first mentioned in the text, and uploaded in this order.</li>
        <li>Figure titles and legends should be       provided in the main manuscript as a List of Figures, not in the graphic       file.</li>
        <li>The aim of the figure legend should be       to describe the key messages of the figure, but the figure should also be       discussed in the text.</li>
        <li>An enlarged version of the figure and       its full legend will often be viewed in a separate window online, and it       should be possible for a reader to understand the figure without moving       back and forth between this window and the relevant parts of the text.</li>
        <li>The legend itself should be succinct,       while still explaining all symbols and abbreviations. Avoid lengthy       descriptions of methods. Statistical information should be given as well       as the statistical tests used.</li>
        <li>Arrows or letters should be used in the       figure and explained in the legend to identify important structures.</li>
        <li>Figures with multiple panels should use       capital letters A, B, C, etc. to identify the panels.</li>
        <li>Each figure should be closely cropped to       minimize the amount of white space surrounding the illustration. Cropping       figures improves accuracy when placing the figure in combination with       other elements, when the accepted manuscript is prepared for publication. </li>
        <li>Individual figure files should not exceed       5 MB. If a suitable format is chosen, this file size is adequate for       extremely high quality figures.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Please note that it is the  responsibility of the author(s) to obtain permission from the copyright holder  to reproduce figures (or tables) that have previously been published elsewhere.  In order for all figures to be open-access, authors must have permission from  the rights holder if they wish to include images that have been published  elsewhere in non-open-access journals. Permission should be indicated in the  figure legend, and the original source included in the reference list;</p>
      <p>          <strong>Supported file type</strong><br>
          <br>
        The following file format can be accepted: TIFF (suitable for images) or  JPEG with 600 dpi, and Word file for the manuscript.</p>
      <p>  <strong>Tables</strong> </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tables must be submitted in  Word (.doc) or Excel (.xls), not as an image.</li>
        <li>Tables must be numbered  consecutively with Roman numerals in the text.</li>
        <li>Tables must have a concise  and descriptive title.</li>
        <li>All explanatory information  should be given in a footnote below the table. Footnotes should be used to  explain abbreviations and provide statistical information, including  statistical tests used.</li>
        <li>All abbreviations must be  defined in this footnote, even if they are explained in the text.</li>
        <li>Tables must be  understandable without referring to the text.</li>
        <li>Tables occupying more than  one printed page should be avoided, if possible.</li>
        <li>Vertical and diagonal lines  should not be used in tables; instead, indentation and vertical or horizontal  space should be used to group data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>References</strong> <br>
        References&nbsp;should  be prepared and listed according to Vancouver standard reference style. Entries  should be arranged in alphabetical order by author at the end of the paper. All  authors’ names should be given. Accuracy and completeness of reference data is  the responsibility of the authors. <br>
        Only  published references should be included in the reference list. Meeting  abstracts, conference talks, or papers that have been submitted but not yet  accepted should not be cited. Limited citation of unpublished work should be  included in the body of the text only. All personal communications should be  supported by a letter from the relevant authors.<br>
        References should be  cited in the text by the authors’ names, with only the first letter in capital  letter followed by the year of publication. For more than three authors, the  first has to be cited followed by the expression <em>et al. </em>(in italic). Small letters close to the year must  differentiate references of the same authors and year of publication. <br>
        Examples: <br>
        (Fujisawa, Atsumi, Kadoma, 1989)<br>
        (Aviral <em>et  a</em>l., 2009)<br>
        (Dodu, Rotari, Vazques, 2012)<br>
        (Liu <em>et  al., </em>2011a)<br>
        (Liu <em>et al.,</em> 2011b)</p>
