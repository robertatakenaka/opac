    <td width="70%"><p>The <strong><em>Revista Bioética</em></strong> was designed by the Conselho Federal  de Medicina –CFM (Federal&nbsp; Council of Medicine of&nbsp; Brazil) to foster  multidisciplinary and pluralistic discussion of issues of bioethics and medical  ethics. Its editorial line, as well as the composition and activities of the  Editorial Board, are completely independent of the plenary session of the CFM.  The authors are responsible for information in the articles, which do not  necessarily express the official position of the Council.</p>
      <p> With quarterly circulation of 10,000 copies distributed free of charge,  the journal Bioethics can also be accessed in full on the CFM site and SciELO,  in Portuguese, English and Spanish as well as in the Virtual Library.&nbsp;The press version in portuguese is  distributed free of charge to interested parties requesting, and federal  institutions of specialty health care, regional medical councils, medical  associations, research groups in ethics, bioethics and human rights, registered  in the CNPq, <em>stricto</em> and <em>lato</em> <em>sensu</em> courses in bioethics,  and the libraries of all Brazilians universities.</p>
      <p> Usually assumes the role of editor of the&nbsp;<strong><em>Revista Bioética</em></strong>&nbsp;2nd  secretary of the board of the CFM, now occupied by <strong>dr.</strong> <strong>Ferreira  Sydney</strong>. It also performs the function of&nbsp; scientific editor the adviser CFM´s presidency <strong>dra. Dora Porto</strong>. The responsible for  the executive secretariat of the journal esp. Bioethics<strong> Vanessa de Santana</strong>, and the bibliographic standards the librarians<strong> Eliane Medeiros and  Rameque Beserra, </strong>also employee of the library of the institution.  The other services essential to the production of the&nbsp;<em>Revista Bioética</em>&nbsp;are  outsourced to contractors for bidding electronic trading, and coordinated by  the editorial staff of CFM.</p>
      <p><strong>Historical</strong><br>
        <br>
        <em>Revista Bioética, </em>edited by the CFM  (Federal Council of Medicine) since 1993, is a pioneer in its specialization in  Brazil. As the first publication in the field of  bioethics in our country, the <em>Revista Bioética</em> is recognized  by scholars and researchers as the main vehicle for the dissemination of their  works. Because it was indexed in  LILACS (Literature in the Health Sciences in Latin America and the Caribbean)  database, in years that followed its establishment, consolidated itself as  streamlining media of bioethical reflection in Brazil.</p>
      <p> In recent  years the journal Bioethics published hundreds of scientific articles as well  editorials and various materials in different sections that were part of their  format, in the previous step to the journal restructuring in mid-2007. Additionally, it is important to inform  that the journal’s electronic page has recorded continuous growth since its  reformulation in June 2009.</p>
      <p> Progressive increase of works received from graduate studies, master and  doctorate levels, students and advisors in Bioethics also testify the  importance of <em>Revista Bioetica </em>for scholars and researchers. The fact  that the periodical concentrates as articles evaluators the largest amount of  experts with specific background in this field of study, among the other titles  published in Health Sciences area. It should be considered still that, as it  only publishes bioethics and medical bioethics, that is, concerning just a  fraction of the broad range of Health Sciences disciplines, approved articles  do not stay long in queue for publication in thematic issue or are presented as  “special supplement”, denomination that, to a certain measure, disqualifies the  editorial evaluation process that every article is subject in quality  scientific journal. Thus, <em>Revista Bioetica </em>fosters the indispensable  updating of topics in this field of knowledge among graduate programs emerging  in the past decade.</p>
      <p> Editors and Board members’ training in bioethics, crucial for full  comprehension of works in peers evaluation, reveals its importance level when  one thinks in the lagging that, to a certain way, “stigmatized” that it is a  field of study, still governing among those that do not dedicated themselves  exclusively to it. The flow of works toward <em>Revista Bioetica </em>denotes not  just authors’ trust related to editors, Editorial Board members’ comprehension  of their ideas, as well as the expectation to reach a reading public related  (and interested) in the kind of reflection provided by it.</p>
      <p> Finally, regarding the specificity of been a pioneer in the field, it is  crucial to point out that it is the sole publication that records the Brazilian  bioethical reflection background.</p>
      <p> Detailed analysis of edited material reflects the path of Brazilian  bioethics, revealing the progressive construction of autochthonous standards  that mark our insertion in the world scene of the discipline. In order to  reflect the state of art of our bioethics (without obviously losing the  connection with the international panorama), <em>Revista Bioetica </em>editors  and Editorial Editorial Board intend markedly, since mentioned restructuring of  the periodical in 2007, to make an updated publication, whose article express  our public interests. Thus, each edition seeks to consider their plurality,  which aggregate multiple perspectives form Health and Health Science areas, as  well as those of humanities nature (philosophical, legal, and theological),  diversity that mirrors the <em>locus </em>in which the publication inserts itself  – trans-disciplinary –, in addition to contemplate works targeted to  epistemological deepening of bioethics itself.</p>
    Its  abbreviated title is <strong>Rev. bioét.(Impr.).</strong>,  which should be used in bibliographies, footnotes and bibliographical  references and strips.</td>
