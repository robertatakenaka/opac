      <p>The <em><b><b>Revista Bio&eacute;tica</b></b></em> was  designed by the Conselho Federal de Medicina to foster multidisciplinary and  pluralistic discussion of issues of bioethics and medical ethics. Its editorial  line, as well as the composition and activities of the Editorial Board, are  completely independent of the plenary session of the CFM. The authors are  responsible for information in the articles, which do not necessarily express  the official position of the Council.</p>
      <p>To be accepted, the manuscripts need to be  previously unpublished, conceptual or documentary in nature, resulting from  research or experience in the field of bioethics or medical ethics, and  critical review related to these themes. All manuscripts will be subjected to  the scrutiny of the editors, of the Editorial Board and of ad hoc reviewers in a double-blind system, and must receive  two approval reports.</p>
      <p>Once received, the manuscript is checked regarding the size of the text  (6,000 words) and abstract (150 words), formatted and checked for originality  in the program plagiarism. At this stage the references are also verified to  make sure they are complete, correctly numbered and presented in Vancouver  style, in accordance with the editorial standards &ndash;which can be found at <a href="http://revistabioetica.cfm.org.br" target="_blank">http://revistabioetica.cfm.org.br</a> in Portuguese, English, and Spanish.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>If all these criteria are met, the manuscript goes to initial editing,  where will be regarded as to the content, suitability for the editorial line,  grammar and orthographical aspects, and given keywords in the database of  Descritores em Ci&ecirc;ncias da Sa&uacute;de &ndash; DeCS (descriptors of health sciences). If it  is not necessary to make any changes to the manuscript at this stage, the next  phase of the editorial process begins. If the need to amend or supplement in  any of these respects is identified, the manuscript will return to authors for  adjustments. Upon receipt of this initial rectified version, the phase of the ad  hoc reviewers starts. If the amount or  characteristic of the identified changes are considered significant, the  manuscript may be rejected with guidance possible resubmission by meeting the  given specifications. </p>
      <p>In this second phase the advisers and ad hoc reviewers have 15 days  after receiving the text to provide the review, which can be of approval; needs  modifications; should be reconsidered after modifications; or not approved. The  criteria considered in the assessments are: if it follows the editorial line,  the originality of the ideas presented, if it is current, clarity of text,  appropriateness of language, relevance of information, logical, conceptual and  methodological consistency. Besides these issues, the title, abstract,  indication and names of parts of the manuscript, an indication of the  objectives, methodology, presentation of results, discussion and concluding  remarks will also be subject to scrutiny. Furthermore, references are checked,  considering their adequacy and currency.</p>
      <p>The criterion for the selection of referees seeks to contemplate the  broader analytical diversity possible, in line with the interdisciplinary field  of bioethics. Each item is shipped with assessor training in specific job  (specialties Health and Biology, Law, Philosophy, Social Sciences, etc.), or to  another study that have discussed the issue (inequities in health, human  rights, abortion, dysthanasia, genetics, research ethics, etc.) and also to  take bioethicist trained <em>lato </em>or <em>stricto sensu</em> in Bioethics to evaluate  the use of ethical concepts and categories. For final approval, it might be  required to reformulate or adjust parts of the article, title or references,  following the recommendations of the review. The authors have 20 to make the  necessary changes.</p>
      <p>In any of these steps  the editors reserve the right to make normative, spelling and grammar  alterations in texts, in order to maintain the formal standard of language and  better understanding of the articles, respecting, however, the authors&rsquo; style.  If the authors decide not to publish of the manuscript, after the initial  editing, the version edited by the <em>Revista  Bio&eacute;tica</em> belongs to it and cannot be sent to another journal. The final version  of the manuscript will be submitted to the authors for approval. However, the  final spelling and grammar review end of the article, the abstracts and the  titles in English and Spanish by specialized companies, and also the final  graphic editing, will not be sent to the authors.</p>
    <p>Articles accepted for publication become property of the journal.</p></td>
