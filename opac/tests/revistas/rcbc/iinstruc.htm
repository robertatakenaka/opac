      <p>The journal of the Brazilian  College of surgeons (CBC), an official division of the CBC, is published  bimonthly in one annual volume, and proposes the dissemination of articles of  all surgical specialties, contributing to its teaching, development and  national integration.
      <p>Articles  published in the journal of the Brazilian College of surgeons follow the  uniform requirements recommended by the International Committee of Medical  Journals Editors (ICMJE &ndash; <a href="http://www.microsofttranslator.com/bv.aspx?from=pt&to=en&a=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.icmje.org%2F" target="_top">www.icmje.org</a>), and are submitted to peer review.&nbsp;The  journal of the Brazilian College of surgeons supports the policies for  registration of clinical trials of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the  ICMJE, recognizing the importance of these initiatives for the record and  international dissemination of information on clinical studies in open  access.&nbsp;Thus, it will only accept for publication the clinical research  articles that have received an identification number on a clinical trial  registry validated by the criteria established by WHO and ICMJE.&nbsp;The  identification number must be registered at the end of the abstract. The Advisory Board (in  charge of the peer-review) receives the text anonymously and decides for its publication.&nbsp;In  the event of conflict of opinions, the Director of publications will evaluate  the need for a new appraisal.&nbsp;Rejected articles are returned to authors.  Only the works within the journal&rsquo;s publication standards will be submitted to  evaluation.&nbsp;Approved articles may sustain editorial-type alterations,  provided that they do not alter the merit of the work.</td>
