The journal's goal is to publish articles that contribute to the improvement and development of the practice, research and teaching topics related to the Spine, Spinal Diseases, Orthopedics and Traumatology, Rehabilitation and related areas.</p>
      <p>Column/Columna publishes preferably original articles of international interest, not only of regional significance. The Editorial Board is formed by members national and international institutions, who work for free to improve the quality of the journal, aiming to make it attractive not only for regional/national research,  but also to the international scientific community.</p>
   <p>It is published in two versions, quarterly in 4 issues per year (March, June, September and December). Its goal is to publish articles that contribute to the improvement and development of the practice, research and teaching of Spine related topics.</p>

   <p>Peer review is one of the factors that sustain the quality of a scientific journal. The editorial board of <i>Coluna/Columna</i> is formed mostly by university professors, which allows a careful and rigorous peer review. All manuscripts, after approval by the editors, will be reviewed by two or more reviewers, anonymity being guaranteed throughout the assessment process (double-blind). Articles which do not present scientific merit and do not fit into the journal's editorial policy will be rejected with no recourse. The reviewers' comments will be returned to authors for changes in the text or by justifying its conservation. After approval by the reviewers, articles will be sent to the associate editors for final approval. Only after final approvals by reviewers and editors, manuscripts will be forwarded to publication.</p>

   <p><b>Methods:</b> it should clearly describe the selection of individuals who took part in the study (patients or laboratory animals, including controls). Identify age, gender, and other important characteristics of the individuals. The definition and relevance of race or ethnicity are ambiguous. Authors should be particularly careful when using these categories. Identify the methods, apparatus (display the name and address of manufacturer in brackets) and procedures in sufficient detail to enable the reproduction of the results by other researchers. State if the study was approved by the institution’s  Ethics Committee (the institution  with which at least one of the authors is affiliated) and provide their  respective identification number. Authors should also note if the Free and  Informed Consent Form was signed by all participants.</p>
   <p><b>Results:</b> they should be presented in a logical sequence in the text, tables and figures. There should not be repeated throughout the text all the data in the tables or illustrations, instead, it should be emphasized or summarized only important observations.</p>
