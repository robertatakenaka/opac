      <p>Acta Limnologica Brasiliensia is a journal by  the ‘Associação Brasileira de Limnologia’ (Brazilian Association of Limnology) which publishes original articles,  short notes, review articles and opinion articles aiming to contribute to the  scientific development of Limnology.</p>
      <p> The Journal covers a broad spectrum, including  any theme of the ecology of continental waters from ecosystems, such as  streams, rivers, lakes, floodplains, swamps, reservoirs and estuarine zones.  The scope of Acta Limnologica  Brasiliensiacomprises all aspects of  theoretical and applied continental aquatic ecology, management and  conservation, ecotoxicology, and pollution. Taxonomic works may also be  accepted, provided that they contain ecological and geographic distribution  information. Manuscripts submitted to the journal must be original with no  simultaneous submission to other periodicals. The authors assume the  intellectual and legal responsibility for the results and the considerations presented.</p>
      <p> Authors are entire responsible for manuscripts  and its do not reflect the opinion of the journal editors. The authors are  entirely responsible for accuracy of the information and citations. The  academic plagiarism at any level is a crime.</p>
      <p> Submitted manuscripts will first be checked  for language, presentation, and style. Scientists who use English as a foreign  language are strongly recommended to have their manuscript read by a native  English−speaking colleague.</p>
      <p> Authors should prepare their papers for  submission following the instructions given below. As long as it adheres to the  journal’s standards, each manuscript will be sent (online) to two peer reviewers  for evaluation. The journal uses the double-blind procedure. After examination  of the content of the work, the Editor in Chief sends the opinions (online) to  the author’s reformulation. After a paper has been accepted, a “proof print” of the article is sent (online) to the authors  for a final revision. </p>
      <p>There are four categories of contributions to Acta Limnologica  Brasiliensia:</p>
      <p>          <strong>1. Primary research  papers</strong> (generally comprising up to 25 printed pages (including tables, figures  and references). See below “Form and preparation of  manuscripts”.</p>
      <p>          <strong>2. Short research notes</strong>, 2-4 printed pages, presenting concise information on timely topics.  Abstract (English and Portuguese), keywords (English and Portuguese), and  references are required; the remainder is presented as continuous text.</p>
      <p>          <strong>3. Review articles</strong>. Review articles should cover subjects falling within the scope of the  journal which are of active current interest. They may be submitted or invited.</p>
    <p>          <strong>4. Opinion articles</strong>. These articles should approach academic discussion on a topic relevant  to the journal scope. The opinion articles should contain up to 3000 words and  express views on theoretical, methodological or current topics in limnology and  should be supported and justified by bibliographic elements. At the Editorial  Board criterion, the journal will publish responses or considerations of other  researchers stimulating discussion on the topics. The views expressed in the  opinion articles are full responsibility of the author (s).</p></td>

      <p>Manuscripts submitted to Acta Limnologica  Brasiliensia should be original and not being considered for publication elsewhere.  Submission should be done in a single  file by SciELO Publication System in the journal link: <a href="http://submission.scielo.br/index.php/alb/index" target="_blank">http://submission.scielo.br/index.php/alb/index</a>. Manuscripts should be  submitted in English, and an abstract in Portuguese must also be included. We  strongly recommend that authors whose native language is not English are  strongly advised to have their manuscript checked by an English-speaking  colleague prior to submission.</p>

        The following order must be used. First page:  title in English (in bold type) and Portuguese, authors’ full name (e.g., Antonio Fernando Monteiro Camargo), affiliation,  address and email address of all authors. All the authors should be identified  by a superscript number. Second page: Abstract (in English and Portuguese) and  keywords. Third and following pages: text of the article (Introduction,  Material and Methods, Results, Discussion, Acknowledgements, and References).  The following information should accompany all species cited in the text: a)  for zoology, author name and the publication date of the original description  should be given the first time that species is cited in the article; and b) for  botany, only the name of the author who made the description should be given  the first time that species is cited in the article.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Abstract</em></strong><strong></strong><br>
        The concise abstract (250-300 words) should be  structured into the following topics: aim, methods, major results, and  conclusions. The topics should be highlighted in bold. Four to five keywords  should be supplied and should be distinct from those used in the title.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Tables and Figures</em></strong><strong></strong><br>
        Tables and figures should be numbered  consecutively using Arabic numerals (Table 1, 2, 3 etc. and Figure 1, 2, 3,  etc.). In the first version, the tables and figures should be inserted in the  text as they are cited. In the final version, the tables and figures should be  inserted after the references. Figures should be in high resolution (300 DPI or  more). Photographs and figures in color can be used in the electronic version  Tables and figures must be mentioned in the text.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Units, Symbols</em></strong><strong></strong><br>
        Use the International System Units (SI),  separating the units from the value with a space, except in the case of  percentages; use abbreviations whenever possible. For compost units, use  exponentials and not forward slashes (e.g., mg.day-1 instead of  mg/day, Xmol.min-1 instead of Xmol/min). Do not add spaces to shift  to the next line if a unit does not fit on a line. </p>
      <p><strong><em>Supplemental Material</em></strong><strong></strong><br>
        Inclusion of supplemental material is  permitted in the electronic version. </p>
      <p><strong><em>References</em></strong><strong></strong><br>

        Schwarzbold (2009); (Calijuri, 2009); (Santoro  &amp; Enrich-Prast, 2010); for more three authors use “et al.”. Citations from the list of references should follow the ISO 690/2010 standard: All references cited in the text should be listed  alphabetically in uppercase letters according to the first authors.
