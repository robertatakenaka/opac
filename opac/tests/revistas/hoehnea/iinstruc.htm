      <p><strong>Hoehnea</strong> publishes original  complete articles, reviews, and scientific notes in all fields of Botany and  Mycology (anatomy, cell and molecular biology, biochemistry, ecology,  phylogeny, physiology, genetics, morphology, palynology, taxonomy) in  Portuguese, Spanish, or English. The review articles are exceptionally accepted  at the discretion of the Editorial Board and must contain a critical analysis  of the main subject and shouldn't be restricted to bibliographic compilations.  Scientific notes must present relevant technical and scientific approaches.</p>
      <p>The author has to send a  letter requesting the submission of the manuscript, containing the  identification of the authors, title,  and full address of the author for correspondence. The corresponding author can  suggest possible reviewers (with their contacts) or request that others may be  excluded. The authors should express their agreement to transfer the copyright  to the Institute of Botany and declare that the manuscript was not published,  in whole or in part, and not submitted to another journal. The submission of  the manuscript implies the author's commitment that it was not and will not be published  elsewhere, in paper or electronic format, in domestic or foreign publications.</p>
    <p>Manuscripts submitted for  review should consist of a single document in Word (.doc, .docx, or .rtf) with  tables and figures with low resolution (150 dpi) attached at the end of the  document. The submission can be done electronically to Hoehnea's email (<a href="mailto:hoehneaibt@gmail.com">hoehneaibt@gmail.com</a>). Accepted for publication, the Editor-in-Chief will request high-resolution tables and illustrations (600  dpi) separately.</p>
    <p><strong>Open Access Policy</strong> - Hoehnea is published under the Open Access model and is therefore free for anybody to read and download, and to copy and disseminate for educational and scientific purposes.</p></td>

It should  not exceed 150 words in a single paragraph. Keywords and Palavras-chave (or  Palabras clave) should be up to five words separated by comma, without period,  and in alphabetic order. Do not use words that have been used in the title.</p>
      <p><i>Text</i> -  start in a new page. Chapter titles should be written in bold, centralized, and  only the initials in capital letters, following as possible: Introduction,  Material and methods, Results, Discussion, Acknowledgments, and Literature cited. Results  and Discussion may be combined in one. Subtitles of these topics should be  written with regular font with uppercase and lowercase letters and separated  from the corresponding text with a hyphen. Use italic for scientific names.</p>
      <p><em>Abbreviations of books and the  taxon's author or authors</em> - should be according to Brummitt &amp; Powell  (1992). For taxonomic papers, in the headers of the species, abbreviations of  rare books must follow the Taxonomic Literature (TL-2) and for periodicals, the <em>Botanico-Periodicum-untianum/Supplementum</em> (B-P-H/S).</p>
      <p><em>Figures and tables</em> - must be consecutively numbered with Arabic numerals following the  order in which they are cited in the text. Do not use abbreviations when referring  to them in the text. For taxonomy papers, figures should be cited as follow:</p>
      <p><b><i>Bauhinia platypetala</i></b> Burch. <i>ex</i> Benth. <i>in</i> Mart, Fl. Bras. 15(2): 198. 1870 = <i>Bauhinia forficata</i> Link var. <i>platypetala</i> (Burch. <i>ex</i> Benth.)<br>
 Wunderlein, Ann. Missouri Bot. Gard.  60(2): 571. 1973. Tipo: BRASIL. Tocantins: Natividade, s.d., <i>G. Gardner 3118</i> (s&iacute;ntipo OFX).<br>
Figuras 7-8<b></b></p>
        <p><em>References in the text</em> - should be cited using the author-date System, with initials in  capital letters; when in the same set of citations, use chronological order; for  two authors, link names with &amp;; for more than two, mention the first,  followed by <em>et al</em>.; for papers published in the same year by the same  author or the same combination of authors, use letters following the publication  year (<em>e.g.</em>: 1994a, b); do not use  comma to separate author and publication year, rather, use it to separate  multiple citations (ex.: Dyer &amp; Lindsay 1996, Hamilton 1988); references to  unpublished results should be as follows: (Capelari, unpublished data).</p>
      <p><em>Herbarium specimens</em> - herbarium material must be cited according to the following model:  BRASIL. S&atilde;o Paulo (written with  versalete effect &#150; small caps): S&atilde;o Paulo, S&atilde;o Paulo, Parque Estadual das  Fontes do Ipiranga, collection date (e.g.: 10-IX-1900), collector name plus  collection number (herbarium acronym). Cite only the herbarium acronym when a  collector number is cited; when collector number is not provided, cite the  herbarium acronym followed by the herbarium registration number [(e.g.:  (SP250874)]. Use the abbreviation s.d. when the date is not provided.</p>
      <p><em>Numbers and units</em> - use abbreviations of measurements units whenever possible; for  composed units use exponentials instead of bars (ex.: mg day<sup>-1</sup>  instead of mg/day, &#181;g L<sup>-1</sup> instead of &#181;g/L), leaving a space between  number and unit (ex. 200 g; 50 m); do not insert spaces in coordinates (ex.:  23<sup>o</sup>46'S and 46<sup>o</sup>18'W).</p>
      <p>For approximate measure use  circa (ca. 5 cm); for a range of measures do not use circa (2-5 cm); for approximate  form use ca. (ca. 3 × 5 cm); for temperature (20 <sup>o</sup>C); for a percentage value only  (60%); variation range to percentages (30 - 50%).</p>
      <p><em>Literature cited</em> - list of the authors in bold letters and in alphabetical order,  capitalizing only the initials; citations of the same author or combination of  authors should follow chronological order for a set of references with the same  first author; work of the author alone must be cited first then the author with  one co-author, and finally the author with two or more co-authors. Full  periodical names should be used. Avoid citing dissertations and thesis; do not  cite conference abstracts, graduation monograph, or articles in press. Authors  should follow the examples:</p>

Do not insert vertical lines;  horizontal lines should be used only in headings and to close the table. Titles  should be concise and inserted in the upper part, starting with &ldquo;Table&rdquo;,  followed by Arabic numbers in the order in which they are mentioned in the  text. Avoid abbreviations (except for units) but if not possible, add its  meaning in the title.

      <p><strong>Figures </strong>- Figures or group of figures should be presented in separate pages,  identified in the back with author's name written with pencil; titles should be  listed in sequence in a separate page at the end of the manuscript. Each figure  (photograph, drawing, graph, map, or scheme) should be numbered with Arabic  numerals in the order of which they are mentioned in the text; small letters  can be used to subdivide figures (dark figure use letters with light color and the  opposite in light figures); figure numbers or letters should be placed,  whenever possible, on the low right corner (use Times New Roman font). In the  bar graphs indicate the conventions of the bars in the figure title. The  maximum length of each figure or group of figures should be 230 mm, including  the title; width can be adjusted to one or two columns (81 or 172 mm). The  originals should be prepared on the final size or be proportional to a maximum  of two times the publication size (the dimensions of the printed page are 230  mm long and 172 mm wide). Plates containing original ink drawings should be  presented on a good quality white/drawing paper. Lines and letters must be  sharp enough to allow reduction. Only good quality, black and white figures  will be accepted. Magnifications (metric system) must be indicated with scale  bars clearly shown in the left side of the figures. Use Times New Roman font in  the titles of figures and graphics. Digital figures are accepted in .tif format  with a minimum resolution of 600 dpi and must not be embedded in MS Word or  Power Point. Figures with low quality or out of proportion will not be  accepted. Manuscripts in Portuguese or Spanish should also include figure title  in English.</p>
