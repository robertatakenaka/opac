       <li>Mission:       Publishing manuscripts about cardiovascular issues, emphasizing original       manuscripts, covering epidemiology aspects, multidisciplinary studies,       evaluations of health care quality, clinical study designs and       single-center and multicenter studies, contributing to disseminating       scientific production about cardiovascular sciences.</li>

     </ul>
     <p><strong>Open Science</strong><strong> </strong></p>
     <p>The term open science  refers to a scientific practice model that is in line with the digital  evolution that proposes the availability of information in web environments, as  opposed to laboratory-confined research.<sup>1</sup><br>
      The practice of open  science involves the publication of research data, speedy editorial and  communication processes through continuous publication of manuscripts and  preprints, greater transparency in review processes and communication flows,  and the pursuit of more comprehensive systems of review of manuscripts and  journals.<sup>2,3</sup> </p>
     <p><em><strong>Preprint</strong></em><strong> </strong></p>
     <p>A preprint is a complete  scientific manuscript that the authors place in a public server. Preprints  contain complete data and methodologies. They are published on the web within  one day approximately, without peer review, and can be viewed for free by  anyone in the world, on platforms currently developed for this purpose,  allowing scientists to directly control the promotion of their work for the  scientific community around the world. In most cases, the same work published  as preprint is also submitted for peer review in a journal. Therefore,  preprints (not validated by peer review) and the publication of journals  (validated by peer review) work in parallel as a communication system for  scientific research.<sup>4,5</sup><br>
       Submitting a manuscript to a  preprint platform, such as <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peerage_of_Science" title="Peerage of Science">Peerage  of Science</a>, <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArXiv" title="ArXiv">arXiv</a>, <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLoS" title="PLoS">PLoS</a> and Nature Precedings, is not considered double  publishing. IJCS will also accept manuscripts that have been published on an  author’s personal or institutional website. Academic theses in the public  domain, according to the guidelines of the author’s academic institution, will  also be considered by IJCS. <br>
      The journal IJCS seeks to keep its platform and rules  constantly updated, in keeping with the practices of modern scientific  publication. Today, we accept preprints and open science platforms to encourage  communication among authors.</p>

    <p><strong><em>TYPES OF MANUSCRIPTS</em></strong></p>
    <p><strong>Original Article:</strong> The journal IJCS accepts all types of original  cardiovascular research, including research in humans and experimental  research. Clinical trials should follow specific recommendations. Note: Systematic analyses and meta-analyses are  considered original manuscripts, not reviews. <br>
      <strong><br>
      Review Article:</strong> The editors send out invitations  for most reviews. However, high-level studies conducted by authors or groups  with previous publications on the subject will be welcome. In this section, any  manuscripts whose main author does not have a comprehensive academic or  publication background verified by Lattes (CNPQ), PubMed or SciELO will not be  accepted. Note: Systematic analyses and meta-analyses are considered original  manuscripts, not reviews.<br>
      <strong><br>
      Viewpoint:</strong> It presents the authors’ stance  or opinion on a specific scientific theme. This stance or opinion must be  sufficiently corroborated by the literature or their personal experience. These  aspects will be the basis of the opinion being issued. <br>
      <strong><br>
      Case Report:</strong> Any cases including original  descriptions of clinical observations or representing the originality of a  given diagnosis or treatment or illustrating situations that do not occur very  often in the clinical practice, which deserve a deeper understanding and more  attention from cardiologists. <br>
      <strong><br>
      Brief Communication:</strong> Original experiences whose  relevance to the knowledge of a subject justifies the presentation of initial  data of small series, or partial data of clinical trials.<br>
      <strong><br>
      Editorial:</strong> Subjects or manuscripts  critically addressed by a subject-matter specialist. All IJCS editorials are  published upon invitation. We will not accept editorials submitted  spontaneously. <br>
      <strong><br>
      Letter to the Editor:</strong> Correspondence of scientific  content related to manuscripts published in IJCS and evaluated for publication  two months before. The authors of the original manuscript will be invited to  respond.</p></td>

<p><strong>Specific  documents and definitions for clinical trials (clinical research):</strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The International Committee of Medical Journal  Editors (ICMJE) and the World Health Organization (WHO) consider it is  important to promote a comprehensive and publicly available database of  clinical studies. The ICMJE defines a clinical study as any research project  that prospectively refers human beings for intervention or simultaneous  comparison or control groups to study the cause and effect relationship between  a medical intervention and a health outcome. Medical interventions include  medications, surgical procedures, devices, behavioral treatments, changes to  healthcare processes, and others.<br>
  For  manuscript submissions, the following is required:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>Study registration number:</strong> this must be       published at the end of the abstract. Any registration that is in keeping       with the ICMJE will be accepted. Example: <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/" target="_blank">http://clinicaltrials.gov/</a>. A complete list of       all clinical trial records can be found at <a href="http://www.who.int/ictrp/network/primary/en/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.who.int/ictrp/network/primary/en/index.html</a>.</li>
  <li>Clinical trials       should follow the <strong><em>CONSORT STATEMENT</em></strong> rules. Please visit: <a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/consort-2010">http://www.consort-statement.org/consort-2010</a>.</li>
  <li>Systematic reviews       and meta-analyses should follow the <strong>rules established by widely known       organizations</strong>, such as: PRISMA (<a href="http://www.prisma-statement.org">http://www.prisma-statement.org</a>), AMSTAR       (<a href="https://amstar.ca/">https://amstar.ca/</a>) and MOOSE (<a href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/jognn/account/MOOSE.pdf">https://www.editorialmanager.com/jognn/account/MOOSE.pdf</a>). The       latter is for observational meta-analyses only.<strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Statistic guidelines</strong></p>
<p>Proper  use of statistical methods as well as their correct description is of paramount  importance for manuscripts published in IJCS. Therefore, some general  guidelines apply to the information to be provided regarding statistical analysis  (for further details, we suggest reading the European Heart Journal&rsquo;s  statistical guidelines).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1) About the sample: Details of both the population of interest and the  procedures used to define the study sample.</p>
  <p>2) Under Methods, there must be a subtopic exclusively addressed to the  description of the statistical analysis used in the study, containing:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Presentation of continuous and/or categorical variables: continuous  variables with normal distribution should be presented as mean and standard  deviation and continuous variables with non-normal distribution should be  presented as median and interquartile range. Categorical variables should be  presented by absolute numbers and percentages, with the relevant confidence  intervals.</li>
      <li>Description of statistical methods used. If more complex statistical  methods are used, some reference literature should be provided for them;</li>
      <li>As a general rule, statistical tests should always be bilateral rather  than unilateral;</li>
      <li>The significance level adopted; and</li>
      <li>Specifications of the software used in the statistical analyses,  including its version.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>3) As for the presentation of the results from statistical analyses:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>The main results should always be described with their relevant  confidence intervals;</li>
    <li>Do not repeat in the body of the manuscript the data found in tables and  figures;</li>
    <li>Instead of presenting excessively long tables, use charts as an  alternative to make it easier for the readers to understand the contents;</li>
    <li>In tables, even if the p-value is not significant, state its value instead  of &ldquo;NS&rdquo; (e.g., p = 0.29 instead of NS).</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Word count limits</strong></p>
<p>The  electronic word count should include the title, the cover page, abstract, text,  references and figures/tables legends. </p>
