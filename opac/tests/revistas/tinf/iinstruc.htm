<p>TransInforma&ccedil;&atilde;o  (e-ISSN 2318-0889) is a specialized periodical that publishes articles that  contribute to the scientific study and development of information science,  librarianship, archivology, museology, and related areas. The journal is  published three times a year and is open to contributions from the domestic and  foreign scientific communities.</p>
<p>The  manuscripts may be refused without detailed explanations after initial analysis  by at least two editors of the Journal. Manuscripts are refused if they are  considered inappropriate or have insufficient scientific priority for  publication by the Journal.</p>

<p>To meet the criteria for internationalization, the  articles sent in English will have publishing priority. However, the authors  can submit the articles in Portuguese and after manuscript assessment, the  authors can pay to have the article translated by translators indicated by the  Journal. Send an e-mail to the Secretary of the Journal at <a href="mailto:transinfo@puc-campinas.edu.br" target="_blank">transinfo@puc-campinas.edu.br</a> to get the list of  companies and/or professionals indicated by the Journal. The authors must  attach to the translated manuscript the translation certificate provided by the  translation company and/or translator.</p>
<p>The Journal publishes articles in the following  categories:</p>
<p>- Original:  investigations based on empirical data using the scientific method that  disclose original results. They are divided into distinct sections:  introduction, methods, results, discussion and conclusion (number of words  should not exceed 5 thousand with a line spacing of 1.5, Arial font size 11 and  A4 paper size).</p>
<p>- Review(only  by invitation): critical synthesis of a theme of interest to the area based on  the analysis and interpretation of the relevant literature containing a  critical and comparative analysis of the works in the area, discussing the  methodological limitations and scope, and indicating perspectives of more  studies in the research line (number of words should not exceed 6 thousand with  a line spacing of 1.5, Arial font size 11 and A4 paper size).</p>
<p>- Essay (only by  invitation): reflection about the theme that encourages new studies (should not  exceed 5 thousand words with a line spacing of 1.5, Arial font size 11 and A4  paper size).</p>
<p>- Communication:  report of an experiment or academic study of an individual, group, community or  organization whose disclosure may contribute to better knowledge of the  information available and to the solution of technical problems in the sector  (should not exceed 5 thousand words with a line spacing of 1.5, Arial font size  11 and A4 paper size).</p>
<p>TransInforma&ccedil;&atilde;o will not assess studies that  already have been presented at events (domestic or foreign) and/or translated  into other languages in order to preserve the original character of the study.</p></td>

Authorship credit must be based on substantial  contributions, such as study conception and design, or data analysis and  interpretation. The inclusion of names of individuals who did not provide  substantial contributions is not justified. The first page of the article must  also contain the name of the institution(s) and academic titles of each author.</p>
<p>The Journal strongly recommends that all authors and coauthors have  their curricula updated in the Lattes Platform when submitting articles.</p>
<p>Manuscript assessment will only begin after the inclusion of this  information in the title page.</p>

<td width="70%"> 
<p>The original articles will be accepted for assessment as long as they  have not been submitted to any other periodical and/or published in events to  preserve the original character of the article. A submission letter must be  attached to the manuscript requesting the Journal to publish the article.</p>
<p>All manuscripts will only  begin the review process if they conform to the Guide for Authors. Otherwise,  they <strong>will be returned to the authors for amendment</strong> and inclusion of  letter or other eventually necessary documents.</p>
<p>Manuscripts with mistakes  and/or morphological or syntactic errors <strong>will be returned before they are  submitted to assessment</strong> of their merit and convenience of publication. See the item Preparation of the  manuscript.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-analysis</strong>: the Editors will assess  the manuscript based on its originality, pertinence, academic quality and  relevance to for the area  of Information Science, Library Science, Archival Science, Museology and  related areas.</p>
<p>If the manuscript is  approved in this phase, it will be sent to <em>ad hoc</em> referees selected by  the editors. Each manuscript will be sent to three referees of known competence on the theme.  One of them may be indicated by the authors. If the referees disagree, the original will be sent to  a fourth referee and so  on.</p>
<p>Manuscript assessment  relies on the double-blind review process, that is, the authors and referees  remain mutually anonymous. Therefore, the authors must do everything possible to avoid being identified in the body of  the manuscript.</p>
<p>The referees may give one  of three opinions: a) approval; b) recommend a new analysis; and c) refusal.  The author will always be informed of the referees&rsquo; opinions.<br>
  The referees&rsquo;  opinions will be analyzed by the associated editors, who will propose to the  Editor-in-Chief whether to publish the article or not. The Editor-in-Chief will  make the final decision regarding article publication (approved or rejected).</p>
<p>Refused manuscripts with possibility of reformulation may be resubmitted  as a new manuscript, starting a new assessment process.</p>
<p>Studies in which the referees request changes and the respective referee  comments will be returned to the authors for them to make the changes. The  manuscripts must return to the Journal within 30 (thirty) days at most,  respecting the time zone of the system (London time).</p>
<p><strong>Accepted  manuscripts</strong>: accepted manuscripts may return to the authors for approval of changes made during the editing  and formatting process to  adjust the manuscript to the Journal&rsquo;s style.</p>
<p><strong>Proofs</strong></p>
<p>Proofs in PDF format will be sent to the authors  for correction of the final art of the article. The proofs must return to the  Editing Center on the date provided (within 48 hours). Other changes to the  manuscript will not be accepted at this time.</p>
<p>At this time the journal  will only accept spelling corrections, substitution of one word for another,  and corrections to the numerical data in the tables and graphs. The inclusion  and/or exclusion of sentences, paragraphs, images, and references will not be  allowed. When making corrections, please follow the instructions below:</p>
<ul>
  (a) In the  PDF file using the available resources; or<br>
  (b) Write  in print on the paper margin and resubmit only the scan of pages with changes;  or<br>
  (c) Inform  the changes in a Microsoft Word document providing: page, column (left or  right), paragraph, beginning of the sentence, and respective line.
</ul>
<p>The authors must sign the terms of agreement with the  final art (text and illustrations). The models will be sent along with the  proofs.</p></td>
