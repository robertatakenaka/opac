      This Journal aim to  publish technical and scientific researches in floriculture, ornamental plants,  landscaping and landscapes. Include in landscaping are urban green areas and  urban afforestation.</p>
      <p><strong>Types of Articles:</strong><br>
        In  terms of content, works may be presented in the form of: <strong>Scientific article, Technical Article, Review Article and Articles  describing varieties and/or cultivars. Also, for each number, it is published  Editorial, being possible to publish Obituary and Book Review.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Editorial  Policies</strong><br>
        ORNAMENTAL HORTICULTURE is  coordinated by the Editor-in-Chief, who is directly assisted by the Associate  and Assistant editors. Also, for each thematic area, there are &ldquo;Area Editors&rdquo;,  that coordinate the proceeding of articles in their areas of knowledge. The  entire process of proceeding and publication is online through a submission  system and the evaluation is done by qualified professionals in double blind  review system. The journal has guidelines to the authors, which are fundamental  for the standardization and quality of publications.</p>
      <p><strong>Peer review process</strong><br>
        The  received manuscript is first analyzed by the Editor-in-chief, and checked by  its scope (areas of publication) and if is according to the Guidelines.<br>
        After  that, it is designated to the Area Editor that, after being checked, it is  indicated to at least 2 (two)&nbsp;<em>ad  docs</em>&nbsp;selected from among those registered in the submission  system of the journal. Using a form, the ad docs verify the text, write  suggestions that are forwarded to the authors through the Area Editor or  Editor-in-chief. Also, they may suggest the approval or rejection of the  manuscript. If approved, the analysis process can be repeated several times  until the text is approved. For each stage a maximum period of 30 (thirty) days  is established so that the final publication time is as short as possible.<br>
        The  journal uses the &ldquo;double blind review&rdquo; process to evaluate the papers. All the  manuscripts&nbsp;have stealthy and impartial character, and the authors as well  as the&nbsp;<em>ad hoc&nbsp;</em>Committee  do not get personal information by itself.<br>
        The  text only can be published after the approval of the Ad Docs, Area Editor,  Editor-in-chief and the authors. After approval, the text is directed to  Editing, and it is reviewed by the Layout Editor and Associate Editor,  verifying the conformity to the journal&rsquo;s guidelines.<br>
        After  been editing, the text returns to the authors for final approval and only after  the formal statement of the corresponding author, the paper is published.</p>
      <p><strong>Readers</strong></p>
The journal articles are  intended for professionals (teachers, researchers), technicians, students and  others interested in the thematic areas of article publication.<font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;        </font></td>
