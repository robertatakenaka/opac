      <p><b>Journal of Coloproctology  (JCOL)</b> Publish  articles that may contribute to the improvement and the development of the  practice, research, and teaching of coloproctology and related specialities.</p>
      <p>        As from vol. 31, n.3, issued in 2011, the <b>Journal of Coloproctology</b> has been  published in English.<br>
        Manuscripts should be submitted in Portuguese or English and  should be unedited. Submission should be exclusively to the <b>Journal of Coloproctology</b>. Simultaneous submission of full or partial  texts, figures or tables is strictly prohibited, except for abstracts or  preliminary reports published in Scientific Meeting Proceedings.</p>
      <p>        The norms are based on the format proposed by the  International Committee of Medical Journal Editors and published in the  article: Uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals,  which was updated in April 2010 and is available on the Website (<a href="http://www.icmje.org" target="_blank">http://www.icmje.org</a>).</p>
      <p><b>Journal of Coloproctology</b> supports clinical trial  registration policies by the World Health Organization - WHO and the  International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). Thus, clinical  research articles will only be accepted if they received an identification  number from one of the Clinical Essay databases, validated by the criteria set  by WHO and ICMJE, whose addresses are available at (<a href="http://www.icmje.org" target="_blank">http://www.icmje.org</a>). The identification number should be  registered at the end of the abstract.</p>
      <p>        In case of research involving human beings, the authors  should send a copy of the approval received from the Institutional Review  Board, recognized by the National Research Ethics Committee (CONEP), in  compliance with National Health Council - CNS Resolution 196/96 or an equivalent  entity in the study's country of origin.</p>
      <p><b>Authorship criteria:</b></p>
      <p>        An individual may be considered an author of an article  submitted for publication only if having made a significant intellectual  contribution to its execution. It is implicit that the author has participated  in at least one of the following phases: 1) conception and planning of the  study, as well as the interpretation of the findings; 2) writing or revision of  all preliminary drafts, or both, as well as the final revision; and 3) approval  of the final version.</p>
      <p>        Simple data collection or cataloging does not constitute  authorship. Likewise, authorship should not be conferred upon technicians  performing routine tasks, referring physicians, doctors who interpret routine  exams or department heads who are not directly involved in the research. The  contributions made by such individuals may be recognized in the  acknowledgements.</p>
      <p>        The author(s) are fully responsible for their manuscripts  and should sign and forward the <b><a href="/img/revistas/jcol/declara.pdf">Declaration  of Accountability and Copyright Transfer</a>.</b></p>
      <p><b>Manuscript categories  accepted by the Journal of Coloproctology:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Editorial:</b> manuscripts on topics of  interest to the historical moment, with repercussions for coloproctology and  related specialties.</li>
        <li><b>Original article: </b>research work with  unedited results that add value to Coloproctology and related specialities.<b></b></li>
        <li><b>Clinical Informations: </b>Case reports,  introduction of new techniques, methods and equipments.<b></b></li>
        <li><b>Review:</b> systematic review and  integrative review. <b></b></li>
        <li><b>Special article: </b>Articles not fall into  the categories above and are of interest for coloproctology and related  specialties. Will be held at the invitation of the Editorial Board.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Description of  procedures:</b></p>
    Each  manuscript submitted to the Journal is initially analyzed for compliance with  the standards presented in the Instructions to Authors, and returned in case of  non-compliance. If approved, the manuscript is forwarded for review to two  reviewers, who analyze the document based on the Analysis and Opinion  Instrument, specifically elaborated for this purpose. They also opine on the  methodological rigor of the adopted approach. In case of disagreement between  opinions, the manuscript is forwarded to a third reviewer. Anonymity is  guaranteed across the judgment process. The Editorial Board analyzes the  opinions and, if necessary, indicates the necessary changes. Manuscripts are  only forwarded for publication after the reviewers and Editorial Board's final  approval.</td>

        <li><b>Results</b>: should be presented clearly and objectively, describing  only the data found, without interpretations or comments. This section can be  easier to understand if accompanied by tables, charts and pictures. The text  should complement but not repeat what is described in the illustrations.</li>
        <li><b>Discussion:</b> should be limited to the  obtained data and achieved results, emphasizing new and important aspects  observed in the research and discussing agreements with and differences from  previously published studies.</li>
        <li><b>Conclusion:</b> should correspond to the  study goals or hypotheses, based on the results and discussion, in line with  the title, proposal and method.</li>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Systematic review:</b> broad research method,  conducted through the strict synthesis of original quantitative or qualitative  research. Aims to clearly answer a specific question relevant to coloproctology  and related specialities.
