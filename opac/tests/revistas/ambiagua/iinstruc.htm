    <td width="70%"><p>AMBIAGUA  has been publishing articles in English, Portuguese and Spanish, but it is  gradually changing to English only. It accepts submissions of unpublished  manuscripts in the interdisciplinary scientific thematic areas related to  Environmental Sciences, Water Resources, Hydrology, Hydrogeology, Environmental  and Sanitation Engineering, Forest Engineering and Forest Resources, Ecology,  Aquiculture, Oceanology and Fishing Resources, Agronomy, Agrometeorology and  Agricultural Engineering, Global Change, Fishing Engineering, Environmental  Zootechny, Geography, Geology, Remote Sensing, Geoinformation, and Spatial  Analysis related to Water or Environmental Sciences.</p>
      <p> Review  articles can be accepted if they include substantial critical analysis of  recent relevant topics.<br>
        Beginning  on January 2017, all submissions must be in English and an issue will be  published every other month.<br>
        Starting on January 2018, the journal adopted a 
      continuous publication model. </p>
      <p> Manuscripts  should be original and submitted exclusively to AMBIAGUA (Revista Ambiente  &amp; &Aacute;gua - An Interdisciplinary Journal of Applied Science).</p>
      <p> APCs  charges are required as instructed in <a href="http://www.ambi-agua.net/splash-seer/?access=fees">http://www.ambi-agua.net/splash-seer/?access=fees</a>. <br>

    <td width="15%"></td>
    <td width="70%"><p>Each  submission will be reviewed by the editor to verify whether or not its content  falls within the focus of the journal and if it was prepared in accordance with  outstanding instructions. The editor may reject the manuscript if it lacks  adherence to the instructions, inappropriate textual description, scientific  misconduct, or if the manuscript has insufficient scientific or technological  merit. From 2017, only articles with potential international interest or with  significant social importance will proceed for peer evaluation. Once this  process is completed, the editor may send the article to one or two members of  the Editorial Committee, so that they can recommend at least two peer reviewers  for further evaluation. The reviewers will be scientists who work in areas  closely related to the subject area of the manuscript and will therefore be  fully qualified to evaluate the manuscript and to recommend acceptance or  rejection. In many cases, they will suggest improvements in order to make the  manuscript acceptable for publication. The reviewers will receive the  manuscript along with instructions concerning the review procedure and an  evaluation form where they may write their comments and recommendations on the  acceptance, correction or rejection of the manuscript. The authors of the  submissions are not identified to the reviewers, or the reviewers to the  authors.</p>
      <p> The  reviewers will strictly consider all suggested criteria in the evaluation form  and will examine the quality and correctness of the manuscript.</p>
      <p> Upon  receiving the reviewers' recommendations, the editor has several options. He  may accept the article with small changes and, accordingly, return the work to  the authors with a list of the corrections to be implemented. Otherwise, he may  opt to send the edited version of the manuscript back to the reviewers of the  article. Reviewers may also ask to see the manuscript after the author's  implementation of his/her suggestions.</p>
      <p> When  the final acceptable version of the manuscript is received by the editor, he will  confirm its acceptance to all authors. Concurrently, all authors will receive  proofs to be returned electronically within 48 hours by the corresponding  author. When the corresponding author returns the final corrections, he  implicitly authorizes the publication in name of all authors and attests that  the manuscript has not been previously published.</p>
      <p> Editing  mistakes, references mentioned in the text that don't appear in the reference  list and small discrepancies between the English and Portuguese abstracts are  examples of small changes. When larger modifications are required, the editor  will return the article with a list of suggestions that the corresponding  author should implement before the manuscript may be considered. Examples of  larger modifications include data analysis using statistical proofs,  substantial revision of tables and figures, repetition of experiments, or  substantial changes in the text language.</p>
      <p> In  the case of rejection after peer revision, the editor may inform the authors  the reasons for rejection. In general, the reasons for rejection involve  inappropriate content of the article for this journal, serious violations in  the publication structure, and manuscripts without scientific or technological  merit. Immediate rejection by the Editor will be mostly based on lack of  international interest or low social impact and poor language and lack of  adherence to instructions.</p>
      <p> Manuscripts  that have been published in proceedings of symposia, conferences, etc., as well  as translated articles from foreign journals, should not be submitted.  Presentations at scientific meetings and publications of short abstracts only  do not preclude submission.</p>
      <p>The  target audience of this scientific journal is the academic community of  postgraduate courses, as well as of research institutions, especially those in  Interdisciplinary Environmental and Water Resources Science.</p></td>

    <td width="70%"><p>I  - Submitted manuscripts should be original, destined exclusively to Ambi-Agua  (Revista Ambiente &amp; Agua-An Interdisciplinary Journal of Applied Science).    
      <p> II &ndash; From January 2017, only submissions in English will be accepted.<br>
      All  submissions have to be via system, after reading carefully all instructions and  registering at:&nbsp;<a href="https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/ambiagua-scielo">https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/ambiagua-scielo</a>      
      <p>
        III  - The manuscripts directed to this journal will be evaluated by the Editorial  Committee and Peer Reviewers, according to their specialty, following the  criteria:<br>
        a)  International scientific interest;<br>
        b)  Scientific technical content;<br>
        c)  Scientific relevance;<br>
        d)  Clarity and quality of the text;<br>
      e)  Quality and adequacy of the theoretical content.
      <p> Please,  be aware that will be considered not ethical withdraw a submission before final  decision of the Editorial Committee.      
      <p> IV  - In each issue, the Editorial Committee will select, among the favorable  manuscripts, those that will be published based on the above criteria. There is  no commitment with submission sequence or time for an editorial decision. This  depends on peer reviewer&rsquo;s and author&rsquo;s response and also on the administration  tasks and limitations.      
      <p>        <strong>Formatting the Text</strong>:<br>
        The  manuscript should be submitted in text format (MS Office), not restricted by  password to allow edition. The final publication will be in pdf, epdf, html,  and xml. The manuscript should be submitted with the following characteristics:
            <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>Language</strong>:       Good English (American or British)</li>
        <li><strong>Page       size</strong>:       equivalent to the size of A4 sheet (210 x 297 mm);</li>
        <li><strong>Margins       (superior, inferior, left and right)</strong>: 2.5 cm;</li>
        <li><strong>Font       type</strong>:       Times New Roman, 12, single space among-lines, in a single column,       paragraphs are left and right aligned;</li>
        <li><strong>Manuscript       size</strong>:       most important in the evaluation is the quality and science contribution       of submission. Normally a manuscript is expected to have a maximum of 10       pages including Tables and Figures (maximum of five all together). Longer       manuscripts are accepted, however additional pages will be charged, counted       after the manuscript has been accepted for publication and layout ready.</li>
        <li>All       manuscripts should also have a Portuguese version of the title, abstract,       and keywords.</li>
        <ul type="circle">
          <li><strong>First        page</strong>:        should contain only the title of the manuscript, without the authors'        name, institutional affiliation, nor e-mail, followed by abstract and        keywords, separated by &ldquo;colon&rdquo; and a period at the end.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Tables       and Figures</strong>: should be numbered with consecutive Arabic numbers,       cited in the text just before it appears in the manuscript (first letter       in capital). Therefore, they should appear in the text just like the final       format of the published articles (please check previously published       articles). Legend of figures should appear at the bottom with first       capital letter, a space of a character, followed by order number, a period       (a dot), and space (e.g.&nbsp;<strong>Figure&nbsp;1</strong>. The dry soil &hellip; .). The       titles of Tables should appear above it and preceded by the word Table       (notice the first capital letter), a space, number order, a dot and space       of a character (e.g.&nbsp;<strong>Table 1</strong>. Concentrations of pollutants &hellip;       .). Whenever Figures and Tables have a reference source, the word       &ldquo;Source:&rdquo; should appear in the inferior part, following by the source       reference. Tables, Figures and Sources texts always finish with period (a       dot). Figures can be colored, with good resolutions (300 dpi) however,       authors should explore all possibilities to reduce the memory size of       manuscript but preserving the quality of figures<strong>.</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>You  can insert images in the article without increasing the file size, just follow  the tips below:<br>
        Use image files in JPG, PNG or GIF formats. These files usually have good  quality standards and do not consume too much disk space and memory;<br>
        To  insert the figures in the text, do not use Copy / Paste (or Ctrl + C / Ctrl +  V);<br>
        Save  the images on your computer that you want to insert into the document;<br>
        Then,  go to the menu option available for insertion of the image of your text editor  (e.g. in MSWord, select Insert / Image / From File) and locate the image you  want to insert into the document. Finally, insert the selected image in the  text.<br>
        These  tips will be useful to get the manuscript uploaded successfully.<br>
        It  is essential that tables are text format, not as a figure or image. Ensure that  they can be edited. Make sure that columns are edited as columns and not  separated by space or tab. All columns should have a title. Send an additional  copy of tables in Excel. <br>
        Figures  must have readable texts, using upper/lower case as appropriate and high  resolution. Do not use titles on top. Be sure that they allow editions.</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>Structure       of manuscripts</strong>: manuscripts in ENGLISH should       have the following sequence: TITLE in English, followed by an ABSTRACT       (followed by three keywords, in alphabetical order, that do not replicate       title&rsquo;s words or appear in the abstract); Title of the<strong>&nbsp;</strong>manuscript       in Portuguese; Abstract in Portuguese (followed by keywords, in       alphabetical order, in Portuguese); 1. INTRODUCTION (including literature       review); 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS; 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION; 4.       CONCLUSIONS; 5. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS (if it is the case, include only       acknowledgment to funding agencies, including the number of the grant);       and 6. REFERENCES (please use references of journals with high impact, do       not use symposia proceedings, thesis and dissertations, unless absolutely       essential and in limited number).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>See  the &quot;Evaluation Form&quot; (<a href="http://www.ambi-agua.net/seer/files/review_form.doc">http://www.ambi-agua.net/seer/files/review_form.doc</a>) to verify the  expected content of each section. Check articles already published to see which  texts should be in bold.<br>
          <strong>UNITS</strong> </p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>Measure       Units</strong>:       use international units with a space after the number (e.g. 10 km h-1,       not km/h, check text for consistency), except % (e.g. 10%) and degree       (e.g. oC).</li>
        <li>Check       any Greek characters and figures carefully.</li>
        <li>Spell       out numbers one through nine, except when used in units.</li>
        <li>Leave       a single space between units: g L&ndash;1, and not g.L&ndash;1,       nor gL&ndash;1.</li>
        <li>Use       the 24-h time system, with four digits for hours and minutes: 09h00;       18h30.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>Titles       (ABSTRACT, 1. INTRODUCTION, 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS, etc.)</strong>:       Use capital letters, 14, bold, aligned to the left.</li>
        <li><strong>Subtitles</strong>:       if they are necessary, they will be written with initial capital letters,       preceded of two Arabic numbers, separated and followed by a dot, 12, bold,       aligned to the left.</li>
        <li><strong>Abstract</strong>:       should contain objectives, methodology, results and conclusions, should be       composed of a sequence of sentences in a single paragraph with maximum 250       words.</li>
        <li><strong>Citations</strong>:       In the text, citations should follow the recommendations of ABNT-NBR 10520       with the following specificities:</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Author's  last name mentioned with just the first capital letter, following by the year  between parentheses, when the author is part of the text. When the author is  not part of the text, between parentheses, put the last name, following by the  year separated by comma. When there is more than one author, their last names  are separated by &ldquo;and&rdquo;. Cited references should be preferably published  recently in the SciELO base (<a href="http://www.scielo.br or www.scielo.org">www.scielo.br or www.scielo.org</a>) or in  international journals of high impact. Preferably, do not cite more than 15 references.</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>Equations</strong>:       Graphs and figures originated in MS Excel should be inserted as objects       that can be edited. The same for the Equations (use Equation editor,       preferably using MS Word 2010 or newer or use MathType) that must be inserted as object,       not as an image and numbered within (parenthesis).</li>
        <li>The authors should express the  equations in the simplest possible way. They should just include only necessary  equations so an average reader can understand the technical basis of the  manuscript. Manuscripts should not have excessive mathematical notation.</li>
        <li><strong>Important       note for English Manuscripts</strong>: All manuscripts written are       required to be submitted in English. Authors that don't have English as       first language, should have their manuscripts revised by a professional       with good English knowledge to review the text (vocabulary, grammar, and       syntax). Submissions can be rejected based on inadequacy of the text       without examination of its scientific merit.</li>
        <li><strong>Examples       on how to cite references in the text</strong>: Jones (2015),       Jones and Smith (2009) or (Jones, 2015; Jones and Smith, 2009), depending       on the construction of the sentence. More than two authors: Jones et al.       (2014) or (Jones et al., 2014). Personal Communications or not published       reference should not be included in the list of references but rather in       the text, between parentheses (Jones, personal communication, 2015).</li>
        <li><strong>List       of References</strong>: It should follow ABNT-NBR 6023       recommendations, here exemplified:</li>
