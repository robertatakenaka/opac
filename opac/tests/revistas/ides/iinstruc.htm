    <td width="70%"><p>The Journal <i>Ilha  do Desterro</i> published the following kinds of documents:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Original article: text which results  from research (bibliographic, documental, experimental …) which is preferably  concluded endorsing the theoretical and methodological bases, which presents a  theoretical reflection that deepens a theme or a new important approach for the  academic debate in the areas of English Language and Literature. The article  must present the procedures applied in the research and the results achieve -  maximum 8000 words, in-line spacing 1.5.</li>

        <li>Unpublished interviews with the  theme of the specific issue - maximum 8000 words, in-space 1.5.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Texts should be  submitted to the jornal with the following configurations: in-line spacing 1.5,  font type Times News Roman, size 12, paper format A4, with no paragraph marks.  Originals should not have page numbers. The first page should begin with the  title and, if the text is in Portuguese, its English translation. One blank  space should be left between all the section titles and the text. The heading  should be followed by the article abstract expressing, in a clear way, the main  idea of the research. If the article is in Portuguese, one English and one  Portuguese version of the abstract are required. Keywords should follow the  abstracts. They should represent the article subject and follow the language of  the abstract, i.e., abstracts in English should be followed by English  keywords, and abstracts in Portuguese should be followed by Portuguese  keywords. In both cases, they must be separated by a semicolon &ndash; maximum 5  keywords.</p>
      <p>Quotes and  citations should be written according to the stylistic pattern corresponding to  each area: articles, reviews and interviews in English of the area of  Literature should follow MLA norms; articles, reviews and interviews in English  of the area of Language should follow APA norms; reviews and interviews in  Portuguese should follow ABNT norms.</p>
      <p>The use of  notes, quotes, graphics, tables, figures, photos etc should be limited to the  minimum necessary. </p>
      <p>It is  recommended the inclusion of the name(s) of the person(s) who somehow aided  either in the collection of the data, illustrations or even in the use of  laboratory in the &ldquo;Acknowledgments&rdquo; before the References. </p>
      <p>The author  should inform the reference of all the information which is not original,  otherwise it is considered plagiarism. The jornal <em>Ilha do Desterro</em> follows the guidelines and recommendations  proposed by CNPq concerning plagiarism and self-plagiarism, which defines the  following modalities of fraud or bad conduct in publications:</p>
      <p>Fabrication or  invention of data: it is the presentation of data or results which are not  true.</p>
      <p> Falsification:  consists in the fraudulent manipulation of results obtained so that their  meaning, interpretation or reliability is modified. In this definition it is  also included the presentation of real results as if they were obtained in  conditions different from those which were actually used.</p>
      <p> Plagiarism: it  consists in the presentation by an author of results or conclusions previously  obtained by other authors as if it is his own authorship, as well as the  presentation of integral texts or part substantial of texts from other authors  without the cautions detailed in the Guidelines. </p>
      <p> One equally  commits plagiarism when uses ideas or data obtained in analysis of projects of  unpublished manuscripts which they had access as consultant, reviewer, editor  and alike.</p>
      Self-plagiarism: it  consists in the total or partial presentation of texts which were already  published by the same author, without the required reference to the previous  works. </td>
