   <p>The journalpublishes:</p>
   <ul><li>Original research articles: It refers to unpublished research works. Each manuscript should clearly state its objective or hypothesis. They must follow the usual presentation form, containing title, Running title, Abstract (maximum 250 words), Key words (three to six), Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, Acknowledgments and References. The maximum numbers of the pages are 12 (single space typed using Times New Roman font)</li>

     <li>You       must send the revision certificate for each manuscript by respectively       reviewers,</li>
     <li>We       strongly suggest a good drafted manuscript in English, we will not revise       English language and,&nbsp; it will be returned to authors if will be the       case,</li>
     <li>We       have by policy to list one good article to be revised and published in the       current number of the journal, indicated by you with agreement by our       Editorial board,</li>
     <li>Please,       send together articles one Editorial and other Acknowledgments section,</li>
     <li>BABT  has no fees either for publishing or access articles. </li>
   </ul>
   <p><strong>Aims and Scope</strong></p>
  <p>The journal's aim is to advance and disseminate knowledge in all the related areas:</p>
  <ul><li>Agriculture, Agribusiness and Biotechnology;</li>
    <li> Human and Animal Health;</li>
    <li> Biological and Applied Sciences;</li>
    <li> Food/Feed Science and Technology;</li>
    <li> Environmental Sciences;</li>
    <li> Engineering, Technology and Techniques.</li>
    </ul> 
  <p>The manuscript must be prepared in English only. We suggest that the manuscript should be reviewed before it´s submission for the first time by an English native speaker and, preferably, scientific experience in the area. Also, assistance of independent editing services can be found at</p>
  <p><u><a href="http://journalexperts.com/" target="_blank">http://journalexperts.com/</a></u></p>
  <p>All services are paid for and arranged by the author, and use of one of these services does not guarantee acceptance or preference for publication.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>THE JOURNAL DOES NOT PUBLISH:</strong></p>
  <p>- Articles with high similarity with other already published in the literature</p>
  <p>- Items that are not contemplated by the journal's scope,</p>
  <p>- Articles with outdated references. It is recommended that the author update any reference list at the time of submission.</p>
  <p>- Articles with poor writing. As the official journal of the language is English, it is recommended that the authors provide for the review by someone who masters the language and preferably be presented a statement of the auditor regarding compliance in relation to the English language.</p>
  <p>- Articles describing partial activities that are related to other research. When the authors wish to anticipate high relevance results without the work is completed, where the publication of opportunity (originality) is compromised by the time factor, we suggest using the mode &quot;letter to the editor.&quot;</p>
  <p>- Research articles specific to a local reality where the results cannot be extrapolated, generalized. In this case the Editor asks that authors seek to highlight the global application of that knowledge, even if the results are reported and apply to the specific site case.</p>
  <p>- Review articles that overlap with others already published. Any review article must necessarily deepen some thesis that has no experimental proof but has potential for research. Or consisting of a compilation of relevant data to the field but are scattered in the literature.</p>
  <p><strong>Examples of what is not:</strong></p>
  <p>- Validation of a protocol already established by international institutions,</p>
  <p>- Set of measures that demonstrate the control of a specific process, such as glucose measurements on a specific population of animals, geographical distribution of a certain animal species, a set of measures with the aim of calibration equipment, etc.</p>
  <p>- Analysis / composition of something that is already prior knowledge,</p>
  <p>- Changes in products that aim to specific applications, such as use of flavoring to make a more palatable product.</p>
  <p><strong>ERRATA (ERRATUM)</strong> </p>
  <p>An erratum applies only to cases where the journal has effectively wrong without the knowledge of the author. The author has a number of instances where errors / mistakes can and should be corrected such as author name, keywords, title, errors in the main text, etc. </p>
<p>The journal submits the final test of the revised and ready article for publication to the author of correspondence with the period of 1 (one) week for review and correction of the article. If the deadline for response expires without a return of the authors, the magazine considers that the article is approved (since the author has not spoken about the need for any changes / fixes) and therefore ready for publication.</p>
<p>Submission and publishing is&nbsp;<strong>free of charge</strong>&nbsp;and do not result in&nbsp;<strong>commercial and profitable purpose</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The manuscript submission in Brazilian Archives of Biology and Technology implies that:</strong></p>
<p>- The manuscript hasn't been partial or entirely published.&nbsp;<em>The manuscript should not be in selection process for publishing in another journal and/or another language</em>;</p>
<p>- The authors agree to transfer copyright to the journal and they are responsible for all of the subject and their legal consequences text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>
 - The submission must have been approved for all the co-authors and whenever necessary, by the authorities of the institution where the work was developed;</p>
<p>- Any study involving human subjects should have&nbsp;<em>Ethic Institutional Review Board Approval and the protocol number should be informed</em>.</p>
<p>- When working with experimental animal the regulations should be observed and the work should be approved by the local ethical committee.&nbsp;<em>The protocol number should be informed.</em></p>
<p>- Authors must ensure that the manuscript does not represent misconduct like fabrication, falsification, plagiarism or duplication of dates. In case of confirmed research misconduct, we will issue a retraction notice to correct the scientific record.&nbsp;<em>Please refer to Singapore Statement at</em>:  &nbsp;<a href="http://www.singaporestatement.org/statement.html" target="_blank">http://www.singaporestatement.org/statement.html</a></p>
<p>- The journal does not take responsibility and/or takes part in eventual lawsuits related to the published articles.</p>
<p>-The veracity of the information and of the bibliographic citations is of exclusive responsibility of the authors.</p>
<p><strong>Submission of manuscripts will only be accepted when submitted electronically using the following link:<br>
