    <td width="70%"><p><strong>Avalia&ccedil;&atilde;o: Revista  da Avalia&ccedil;&atilde;o da Educa&ccedil;&atilde;o Superior</strong>&nbsp;aims to contribute to the  development of studies and research on higher education, particularly on  institutional evaluation of higher education and issues related to perspectives  and trends in higher education and higher education and science and technology  policies. It aims to catalyze and disseminate scholarly works, which are mainly  produced in academic settings and contribute to the development of  institutional evaluation theories and practices and general debates about  higher education in Brazil and other Latin American countries. Papers are  published in the original language of the author, preferably in Portuguese,  Spanish or English. The journal is oriented to teachers and students,  particularly graduate education and neighboring areas and it is also of  interest to policy makers connected to higher education. In addition to  scholarly articles the journal also publishes reviews and documents pertinent  to its themes of interest . Papers are submitted to the evaluation of members  of the Editorial Board or ad hoc reviewers.</p>
      <p> Avalia&ccedil;&atilde;o publishes articles - not published in books, magazines or other  journals - with substantive contributions on issues relevant to its central theme.  Review essays will only be published when it is in the interest of the  Editorial Board. The reviews should be unpublished comments on recently  published books (not more than 24 months).</p>
      <p> Descriptive articles lacking a guiding question, projects or research  reports, dissertation chapters, experience reports, previously published articles,  either in hard copy or in digital formats, will <strong>not be accepted</strong>&nbsp;for  publication.</p>
      <p><strong> Evaluation and  publication criteria</strong></p>
      <p>Avalia&ccedil;&atilde;o follows strict merit criteria for  publishing papers. The evaluation process is the same for all submited  articles. After submission, papers are submited to the Editorial Board and  evaluated for their adequacy to the journal's objectives and scope, which takes  about thirty days. After that, selected papers are submitted to a second round  of evaluation, in which their conformity to publication norms (ABNT) are  checked. If there are structural problems with the paper, authors are inveted  to submit modified versions of the text. Lastly, the third stage consists of  evaluation through a blind peer review system, which may take up to five  months, depending on the influx of submissions. Publication follows the order  of received submissions, but exceptions may occur at the Board's discretion.</p>
      <p><strong>Avalia&ccedil;&atilde;o</strong> seeks, since 1996, to contribute to the  dissemination of knowledge and the debate among the university community about  studies and research on higher education. In this sense, the Editorial Board  recommends that the authors be advised of the discussions presented in papers  published by the journal in the preceding editions, referencing them when  appropriate.</p>
      <p> The journal operates  exclusively by an online submission system (SciELO), which uses the Open  Journal System as support management for scientific journals. The whole process  of submission and arbitration of papers will go through this electronic  platform.<br>
        Authors should register with  the <em>Scielo</em> system and submit their  work for consideration. <strong>Avalia&ccedil;&atilde;o</strong> reinforces that, at the time of paper  submission, all authors should be included in the metadata. After paper  submission, no author may be inserted.</p>
      <p> Furthermore, <strong>Avalia&ccedil;&atilde;o</strong> reinforces that the authors carefully review the items and see if they are  appropriate to the journal's formatting requirements and ABNT.<br>
        The authors shall send, in a  separated file, along with the main text, the following information:</p>
      <p> - Personal and academic data related to the institution, job position and  academic title.<br>
      - Mailing address, e-mail and telephone number.</p></td>

      <p>  <strong><u>Direct quotation:&nbsp;</u></strong>textual transcription of part of the literary composition of the  consulted author.</p>
      <p> The short quotation (up to 3 lines) is inserted in  the text, between quotation marks. Longer quotation (more than 3 lines) shall  be an independent paragraph, typed in single space and 2,5cm indentation from  the left margin, with the same font, size 10, without quotation marks. Text  suppression inside the quotations shall be placed between brackets (ABNT - NBR  10520/2002).</p>
      <p> The norms indicate 4cm indentation; however, we  have chosen to use 2,5cm due to the periodic page size. Every direct quotation  shall be followed by the Author's last name in capital letters, publication  year, page number, separated by commas, between parentheses.</p>

        <strong>&nbsp;</strong>&quot;The high percentage of small institutions is congruent with the  high percentage of institutions with a low degree of complexity.&quot;  (GARC&Iacute;A-GUADILLA, 2.000, p. 24).</p>
      <p>        <strong>Exemple of direct citation  with more than 3 lines</strong> <br>
        Louren&ccedil;o Luzuriaga (1980, p. 22) notifies that:<br>
        The educational  ideal is not something vague and buoyant, distant from reality, but precise and  concrete, as the reality itself. It constitutes, indeed, such intrinsic part of  our lives and of the human society as in the actions and the social  institutions, generally more decrepit and circumstantial than the human  historic ideals.</p>
      <p>  <strong><u>Indirect citation</u></strong><strong>:&nbsp;</strong>text based on the work of  the consulted author. In the indirect citations, one must indicate the author's  last name and the publication date.<br>

        <strong>The quotation period mark  shall come after the end of the statement, therefore of the parenthesis, except  in cases of quotation of up to 3 lines, inserted in the text, when it does not  end the paragraph.</strong></p>
      <p><strong><u>Footnotes</u></strong><u> </u><br>
        They shall be restricted to personal comments and  observations, destined to render explanation or to set forth considerations.  Displayed at the end of the page, also in size 10.</p>
      <p>  <strong><u>References:</u></strong><u> </u><br>
        They shall obey the ABNT, NBR 6023/2002  prescriptions. They shall be presented at the end of the text in alphabetic  order. Book titles and journals shall be presented in bold and justified and  left justified.</p>

      <p><strong>Reciprocity</strong><br>
        Authors who submit papers to the journal are committed to contribute  with referees to others papers. The Editorial Board reserves the right not to  submit to the second stage of evaluation (blind peer opinion) papers whose authors  repeatedly and without reasonable justification fail to issue opinions when  asked by the journal.</p>
      <p>  <strong> Copyright and exclusivity</strong><br>
        Submitting a paper,  the authors undertake not to send it to another journal during the evaluation  process.<br>
        Sending any contribution automatically implies full assignment of  copyright to the&nbsp;<em>Avalia&ccedil;&atilde;o</em>/RAIES.</p>
      <p><strong>Scientific Ethics</strong><br>
        Approved papers will undergo plagiarism test and  &quot;self-plagiarism&quot; or republication (publication as new material from  texts already published).</p>
