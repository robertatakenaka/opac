      <p><strong>Scope and policy</strong><br>
The Brazilian Journal of  Epidemiology aims at publishing not previously published <strong>Original Articles</strong> (maximum of 21,600 characters including spaces), including  critical <strong>reviews</strong> about a specific  subject, which contribute with the knowledge and development of Epidemiology  and related sciences. Only Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses will be  accepted; Integrative Reviews will not be accepted. </p>
      <p>It also publishes articles in the  following sections:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>Original Articles with research results</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Methodologic:</strong> Papers that analyze the different techniques used in       epidemiological studies;</li>
        <li><strong>Debate:</strong> Aims at discussing different views of the same subject, which can be       presented as a consensus/dissensus, original article followed by comments       of other authors, reproduction of round tables and other similar forms;</li>
        <li><strong>Notes and Information:</strong> previous notes of investigation papers, as well as brief reports       of new aspects of epidemiology, besides news regarding events in the       field, new books and others (maximum of 6,450 characters including spaces);</li>
        <li><strong>Letters to the Editor:</strong> comments of readers about the papers published in the Brazilian       Journal of Epidemiology (from 3,260 to 4,570 characters including spaces).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The manuscripts presented should be  exclusive addressed to the Brazilian Journal of Epidemiology; its simultaneous  presentation to another journal is not allowed. After the opinions are sent,  the authors have to sign a declaration, according to the model provided by RBE  (Declaration of Exclusivity, Declaration of Copyrights and Declaration of  Conflict of Interests). The authors are entirely responsible for the concepts  issued in any of the sections of the Journal. </p>
      <p>The Journal is in charge of the  published manuscripts, and it is forbidden to reproduce it &ndash; even if partially  &ndash; in other journals, as well as to translate it to another language without the  previous consent of the Editorial Board. Therefore, after the approval for  publication, all papers should also have a copyright transfer agreement signed  by the authors, according to the model provided by the Journal in advance. </p>
      <p>Each manuscript is analyzed by at  least two evaluators, indicated by one of the Associated Editors, who will  elaborate a final and conclusive report to be submitted to the Scientific  Editor. In the first of submission, the secretariat verifies if all of the  criteria were met, and contacts the author. The manuscript is sent for the  editors&rsquo; appreciation only if it meets all of the requirements established by  RBE.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian Journal of  Epidemiology does not charge fees for the submission of papers, nor to evaluate  or publish them. </p>
      <p><strong>Approval by the Research Ethics Committee (CEP)</strong><br>
        This requirement has been present  since RBE started being published, and we reassure it now, demanding special  reference in the texts. This demand can be dismissed in some types of studies  that use only aggregate data, without identifying the subjects, available in  databases and common in the health field. No instance is better than a CEP to  analyze the nature of the investigation proposals, according to the orientation  of the National Ethics Research Commission (CONEP/CNS/MS). The CEP that  approves the investigation must be registered in CONEP. </p>
      <p>The following Resolutions should be contemplated: </p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>196/96, reformulated by 446/11,       about Guidelines and Regulatory Rules of Research Involving Human Subjects;</li>
        <li>251/97, about Rules of Research       Involving Human Subjects for the field of Research with New Drugs, Medication,       Vaccines and Diagnostic Tests;</li>
        <li>292/99 and the Regulation of       August, 2002, concerning the special thematic field of Research       Coordinated from Foreign Countries, or with Foreign Participation, and       Research Involving the Shipping of Biological Material Abroad. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Brazilian Journal of  Epidemiology supports the policies from the World Health Organization (WHO) and  the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) to register  clinical trials, recognizing the importance of these initiatives for the  registration and international publication of information on clinical trials,  with open access. Therefore, after 2007, only the papers of clinical research  that have received an identification number in one of the Clinical Trial  Records validated by the criteria established by WHO and ICMJE were accepted  for publication; their addresses are available in the website of ICMJE. The  identification/approval number must be registered in the title page.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>The institutions that register  clinical trials according to ICMJE criteria are:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Australian New Zealand Clinical       Trials Registry (ANZCTR)</li>
        <li>ClinicalTrials.gov</li>
        <li>International Standard       Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN)</li>
        <li>Nederlands Trial Register (NTR)</li>
        <li>UMIN Clinical Trials Registry       (UMIN-CTR)</li>
        <li>WHO International Clinical Trials Registry  Platform (ICTRP)</li>

The final list must contain the numerical order of the text, ignoring  the alphabetical order of the authors. Titles of books, publishers or others  must not be abbreviated. Journal titles will be in accordance with the  abbreviations in the Medicus/Medline Index. The names of the 6 first authors  have to be included, followed by the expression et al. when there are more  authors. Personal communications, papers that have never been printed or  ongoing papers can be mentioned when absolutely necessary, but they should not  be included in the reference list; these should be presented in the text or in  a footnote. When an article is about to be published, the following must be  indicated: journal title, year and other available data, followed by the  expression &ldquo;in press&rdquo; between parenthesis.
