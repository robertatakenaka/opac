      <p><b>Cadernos de  Pesquisa</b>, is a quarterly scientific journal  that publishes academic findings that are directly or indirectly related to  education, including innovative work relating to research, essays and other  types of texts. The journal broadly addresses the field of education, contributing  to the subject of educational studies that involve matters related to gender  issues, racial relations, childhood, youth, school, work, family, social  policies in an interdisciplinary manner. The broad scope encompasses different  areas within the field of the humanities, from various theoretical and  methodological perspectives, allowing for the exchange of information and discussion  on the main issues in these fields. </p>
      <p> The journal's priority is the publication of empirical  historical and/or documentary research, in particular that which is conducted  in Brazil, although there is space for texts from abroad. It also welcomes  essays concerning theoretical and methodological contributions, and makes texts  written by recognized international authors available to the Brazilian reader,  who may cite studies in the field, translated into Portuguese or Spanish. </p>
      <p> The journal publishes texts in Portuguese and Spanish,  and makes English versions available, or, in the case of a translation, in the  original language of the article on the <a href="http://publicacoes.fcc.org.br/ojs/">SEER/ojs  platform</a>, on the SciELO  and <a href="http://educa.fcc.org.br/">Educ</a>@ site, containing articles selected by the Editorial Board for each  issue.</p>
      <p> The material must be original and with exclusive  submission to <b>Cadernos de Pesquisa</b>.  Accepted papers must not be published elsewhere for six months after its  publication in the journal. For permission to reproduce the text into another outlet,  consult <a href="mailto:cadpesq@fcc.org.br">cadpesq@fcc.org.br</a>. </p>
      <p> To submit an article <b>Cadernos de Pesquisa</b>, it is necessary to: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Register in the  system - <a href="http://publicacoes.fcc.org.br/ojs/index.php?journal=cp&page=author&op=submit&path%5B%5D=4&articleId=2936">click here to subscribe</a> (login and password are required to access the  system). </li>
        <li>Confirm that  the text is original and unpublished, and has not been submitted for  publication in another journal. </li>
        <li>Forward two  versions of the article: one for evaluation, in PDF format, with no information  that identifies authorship; and another, in Microsoft Word, with all  information. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Ideally, if the article is co-authored, all authors  should be registered in the system. However, it is possible to submit the text  with only one registered author. In both cases, the person who submits the file  must include co-authors in Step 3. Submission of Metadata &#8594; Add Author. </p>
      <p> To monitor the status of submission, access the  following: system &#8594; menu &#8594; access &#8594; login and password. </p>
      <p> Authors of published texts will receive up to three complimentary  copies of the issue in which their pieces are published. </p>
      <p>The ideas and opinions expressed in the articles published are the sole responsability of the authors. Copyright of published materials belongs to Cadernos de Pesquisa, which adopts the license Creative Commons BY-NC-type &quot;Assignment not commercial&quot;. The online version is open and free.</p>
      <p>Cadernos de Pesquisa not charge submission fees or evaluation  articles (articles processing charges - APC).</p>
      <p><strong>Plagiarism policy</strong><br>
        All manuscripts submitted to Cadernos de Pesquisa are checked by an anti-plagiarism program before being sent for assessment. The purpose of this procedure is to identify plagiarism and self-plagiarism. Plagiarism is the total or partial reproduction or copy of the intellectual work of another person without crediting the source. Self-plagiarism is the total or partial reproduction of one&rsquo;s own previous work, already published, without citing that it was used previously. To avoid characterization as self-plagiarism, the journal accepts manuscripts from (1) research reports, theses and/or dissertations and (2) papers presented at scientific events. In the first case, the author(s) should conduct a process of preparation and synthesis of the text that results in a scientific paper, according to the journal&rsquo;s standards. In the second case, the author should  invest in extending the previous version, with new data and reflections. Upon submission, there should be clear information about the original work.</p>
      <p><strong>Peer review</strong><br>
        The Editorial Board conducts a prior analysis of the original work received in order to evaluate its suitability regarding focus and scope/editorial policy of the journal;  publishing standards and minimum criteria of a scientific paper in the field of Humanities. If the papers are rejected in this first analysis, they are returned to the authors. If they pass through this initial screening, they are forwarded to specialists, who have a PhD in the field and are affiliated to institutions other than those of the authors, in order to assess their merits. The selection process of the manuscripts involves two reviewers chosen from the following: external evaluators, researchers from the Carlos Chagas Foundation and members of the Editorial Board.<br>
