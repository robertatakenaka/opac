      <p>Papers submitted to JMOe are numbered by the electronic management system and  analyzed by the editors. If they are in a proper  format, they come under revision. 
Then at least two researchers (usually, a Brazilian and a  foreigner) who are experts in the area of the paper are chosen. The electronic management system sends a link to them  with access to the paper and the  review form with a request for review.</p>
      <p>Reviewers are asked to inform, in one week, if the review will be performed 
        or not. If not, new referees are chosen and requested to review the paper. 
        At the end of the review process, if the reviews are congruent and the 
        editors agree with them, the authors are informed of the result.</p>
      <p> In the case of two different reviews, the paper is submitted to a third 
        reviewer. In case of approval, it may be asked (or not, depending on the 
        situation) a final format revision. After that, the paper is sent to publication.</p>
      <p> If the result is re-submission, authors are informed and receive the 
        feedback from the reviewers. Authors have approximately one month to re-submit 
        the revised version of the paper.</p>
      <p> The revised paper is sent to the same reviewers, in order for them to 
        check if the suggestions were accomplished and if the paper can now be 
        accepted. When the paper is rejected, the authors are informed and receive 
        the feedback from the reviewers to understand the reasons for this result.</p>
      <p>The Editors or the Associate Editors, only, contact the authors and reviewers through the electronic management system. 
        The other members of the Editorial Board help indicating reviewers, advising 
        on ethical matters, assisting in the final decision and, eventually, participating 
        as reviewers.</p>
      <p>Every two years, the Brazilian Microwave and Optoelectronics Society 
        and the Brazilian Society of Electromagnetism jointly organize the MOMAG 
        Symposium. The authors of the papers ranked best in this event are invited 
        to submit an extended version of these papers to JMOe. In this case, the 
        review process of these extended versions is conducted by guest editors 
        who follow the journal standards.</p>
      <p> The areas of interest of JMOe are: Electromagnetic Field Analysis, Computer 
        Aided Design, Microwave Technologies, Photonic Technologies, Packaging, 
        Integration and Test, Millimeter Wave &amp; Lightwave Technologies, Electromagnetic 
        Applications and other topics such as education, industrial, biological 
        and medical applications; broadband microwave and optical communication 
        systems; wireless and cellular communications, optical networks and services; 
        microwave and optical sensors.</p>
      <p> JMOe publishes scientific, original and complete papers. The journal 
        serves the national and international scientific community.</p>
      <p>Articles accepted for publication become property of the journal.</p></td>
