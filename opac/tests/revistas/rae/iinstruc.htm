      <p>The editorial line of <b>RAE-Revista de Administra&ccedil;&atilde;o de Empresas </b></p>
      <p><b>Mission<br>
        </b>The mission of <b>RAE-Revista de Administra&ccedil;&atilde;o de Empresas </b>is 
        to encourage the production and dissemination of knowledge about business 
        administration.</p>
      <p><b>Focus <br>
        RAE</b> is interested in publishing papers that are theoretical in their 
        development, empirical works and essays.</p>
      <p>We accept contributions from both Brazil and abroad in the fields of 
        business administration and related areas. We encourage a wide range of 
        approaches and views.</p>
      <p>As a journal of general interest in the business administration area 
        it covers a broad spectrum of sub-areas of knowledge, perspectives and 
        issues. </p>
      <p><b>RAEs</b> main readers are academics - professors, researchers and 
        students </p>
      <p><b>Submission<br>
        </b>Articles  must be sent to the Editorial Office by Internet through ScholarOne, an online submission and paper 
        management system which we operate in partnership with SciELO: <a href="http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/rae-scielo">http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/rae-scielo</a>.<i></i></p>
      <p>Articles can be submitted in Portuguese, English or Spanish,        observing the correct format, text positioning and style, as well as        the standardization norms specific to the section the work falls        into. It is essential to carefully read the <a href="http://rae.fgv.br/manual-rae">RAE-publications        Guidelines</a>, especially the <a href="http://rae.fgv.br/manual-rae/artigos">Format</a> and <a href="http://rae.fgv.br/manual-rae/autor">Author</a> sections, for an 
      efficient preparation of the article. <br>
      The articles published in RAE are bilingual: Portuguese/English or        Spanish/English. After approval, it is the authors' responsibility to        provide the English version when the text is submitted in      Portuguese or Spanish.</p>
      <p>        Authors can only submit one article at a time (this rule also        applies to calls for papers), i.e., during the time an article is being        evaluated, its authors cannot submit another one, whether as the        main author or a co-author. If the article is rejected in one of the        steps of the process, the authors may submit the same article,        provided it has been returned in the &quot;reject &amp; resubmit&quot; status, or      submit a new article.</p>
      <p><b>Originality and exclusivity <br>
        </b>Papers submitted for publication in <b>RAE-Revista de Administra&ccedil;&atilde;o 
        de Empresas </b>must be original, hitherto unpublished and not being considered 
        by any other publication.</p>
      <p><b>Review<br>
        </b>Articles submitted to the <b>RAE</b> first pass through a preliminary 
        triage in terms of format (to see whether they conform to 
        expected norms and formats) and then pass through a system<br>
        that detects similarities. They are then evaluated in a three step        process:<br>
        <br>
        <b>Desk review conducted by the Editor-in- Chief</b>, who examines        whether the work fits into the journal's general scope and        whether it has potential for publication;<br>
        <br>
        <b>A preliminary evaluation by a member of the Scientific        Editorial Board</b>, who seeks to identify the article's contribution        to its specialty; the consistency of its scientific methodology and        the sample used; as well as its relevance and whether its        bibliography is up to date. In this step, the scientific editor        decides whether the article should be rejected or should continue        on to the next step in the process; and<br>
        <br>
        <b>The double blind review:</b> coordinated by a member of the        Scientific Editorial Board from the article's specialty, consists of        the interaction between the authors of the paper and two<br>
        specialists who in evaluating the work make comments and        suggestions to improve it. Usually the scientific editors and the        Editor-in- Chief add editorial advice to the reviewers' suggestions        to improve the article for publication. This step involves 
        continuing reassessments and gathering resources to improve the        article.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Preparation for publication<br>
        </b>Once approved, the article is submitted for editing and language 
        revision. The Editorial Board submits the final version for authors' 
        approval and any updates, such as institutional affiliation.<br>
        <br>
      From 1 January 2018, if an article is submitted in Portuguese or        Spanish and approved, the authors are responsible for providing      its translation into English, thus ensuring its bilingual publication.</p>
