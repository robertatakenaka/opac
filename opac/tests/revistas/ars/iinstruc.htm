      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The editorial policy of ARS gives priority to printing mainly original and unpublished content. As a result, in 80% of the cases articles and visual essays specifically developed for the publication arise from recent academic and artistic researches. In parallel, the journal is also committed to regularly conveying fundamental texts from History and Theory of Art and Art Criticism which have been released long ago, in an attempt to recover research references significant to undergraduate and graduate students.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As an academic enterprise developed in an art school, the journal is attentive to the debate on intellectual formation in two ways, not only in regard to the development of students who aim to become artists, professors, educators or theoreticians but also to the development of an instance for creation and criticism that contributes to engendering autonomous perspectives within the globalized setting of contemporary culture.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The journal's editorial aim consists of 1) promoting brazilian artistic and cultural production; 2) granting the privileged debate and exchange of ideas enabled by the academic sphere to artists, art professors and researches in early or consolidated careers stages, who act in Brazil or abroad; 3) establishing a critical and renewing mutual debate with academic, artistic and cultural fields, as a means of building a constructive presence of the University in Brazilian's society; 4) pursuing and encouraging academical excellence in artistic, cultural and scientific research; 5) promoting exchanges between visual arts and other realms of cultural and scientific production; 6) developing the emerging Brazilian readership in the sphere of cultural and artistic knowledge.</font></p>
