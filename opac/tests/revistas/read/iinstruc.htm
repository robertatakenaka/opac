      <p>REAd is open to all  topics relating to management of organizations. REAd sporadically publishes  thematic special issues in English, electronically, and also in hard copy.</p>
      <p>        Manuscripts should only  be submitted in electronic form, via e-mail: read@ea.ufrgs.br. REAd subjects  the manuscripts received to a peer review process. They are then given a code  and referred for pre-assessment. After which they are sent to reviewers,  without the authors and institutions being identified (blind review). The  authors&rsquo; names will be revealed only when the article or case is published.  REAd adopts a continuous flow policy, so that an author may send a manuscript  at any time. Deadlines for the submission of manuscripts are only applied in  the case of the special editions. See also "Evaluation Mechanisms".</p>
      <p><b>Assessment Criteria:</b></p>
