    </b>The Brazilian Journal of Geology  (BJG) is a quarterly journal published by the Brazilian Geological Society with an electronic open access version  that provides an in-ternacional medium for the publication of original  scientific work of broad interest concerned with all aspects of the earth sciences  in Brazil, South  America, and Antarctica,  in-cluding oceanic regions  adjacent to these regions. The BJG  publishes papers with a regional appeal and more than local significance in the  fields of mineralogy, petrology,  geochemistry, paleontology,  sedimentology, stratigraphy, structural geology, tectonics, neotectonics, geophysics  applied to geology, volcanology,  metallogeny and mineral deposits,  marine geology, glaciology, paleoclimatology, geochronology, biostratigraphy, engineering geology, hydrogeology, geological hazards  and remote sensing, providing a  niche for interdisciplinary work on regional geology and Earth history.
      <p> The BJG publishes articles  (including review articles), rapid communications, articles with accelerated  review processes, editorials, and discussions (brief, objective and concise comments  on recent papers  published in BJG with  replies by authors).</p>
      <p> Manuscripts must be written in  English. Companion papers will not be accepted. </p>
      <p><b>ETHICS IN PUBLISHING<br>
      </b>The BJG follows the Code of Good  Scientific Practice published by the S&atilde;o Paulo State Research Foundation &ndash; FAPESP, see <a href="http://www.fapesp.br/boaspraticas/FAPESP-Code_of_Good_Scientific_Practice_2014.pdf">http://www.fapesp.br/boaspraticas/FAPESP-Code_of_Good_Scientific_Practice_2014.pdf.</a></p>
      <p><b>FUNDING SOURCES </b>
        <br>
      Authors should identify the  sources of financial support for the research and/or preparation of the article  and briefly describe the role of sponsor(s), if any, in study design; in the collection, analysis and  interpretation of data; in the writing of the report; and in the decision to  submit the article for publication. </p>
      <p><b>COPYRIGHT AND OPEN ACCESS<br>
      </b>Upon acceptance of an article,  authors will be asked to complete a &ldquo;BJG publishing agreement&rdquo; transferring the copyright to the Brazilian Geological Society. </p>
      <p> The BJG is an open access journal which means that all  articles will be freely available to the wider public and that reuse will be permitted. </p>
      <p><b>CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS </b>
        <br>
      All authors are requested  to disclose any actual or potential  conflict of interest including any financial, personal or other relationships  with other people or organizations that  could inappropriately influence, or be perceived to influence,  their work. </p>
      <b>SUBMISSION  DECLARATION AND VERIFICATION </b>
      <p>Submission of an article implies  that the work described has not been published previously (except in the form  of an abstract or as part of a published lecture or academic thesis), that it is not under consideration for  publication elsewhere, that its publication is approved by all authors&nbsp; as well as tacitly or explicitly by the  responsible authorities where the work was carried out, and that, if accepted,  it will not be published elsewhere in the same form,&nbsp; in English or in any other language,  including electronically, without  the written consent of the copyright-holder. Authors should verify the  originality of the article by checking for plagiarism with any available software. <br>
        In addition, the corresponding  author must state that: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The  article has not been partitioned and that its con- tents are fully and  independently understandable; </li>
        <li>The article,  edited in Microsoft  Word, A4 format, does not exceed 12,000 words; </li>
        <li>Each  illustration or table is being sent in a separate file (.tif for figures); </li>
        <li>No  text or illustration file exceeds  10 Mb; </li>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="15%"></td>
    <td width="70%"><strong>Use of word processing software<br>
    </strong>Regardless of the file format of  the original submission, at revision you must provide us with an editable file  of the entire article. Keep the layout of the text as simple as possible. Most  formatting codes will be removed and replaced on processing the article. The  electronic text should be prepared in a way very similar to that of  conventional manuscripts.
      <p> To avoid errors you are strongly advised to use the &lsquo;spell-check&rsquo;  and &lsquo;grammar-check&rsquo; functions of  your word processor. </p>
      <b>Article structure<br>
      </b>There are no strict formatting  requirements, but all manuscripts must  contain the essential elements&nbsp; needed to  convey your manuscript, for example, Abstract, Keywords, Introduction,  Materials and&nbsp; Methods,&nbsp; Results, Conclusions, References, Artwork and  Tables with Captions.
      <p> Divide the article into clearly defined and numbered sections. Subsections  should be numbered 1.1 (then 1.1.1, 1.1.2, ...), 1.2, etc. (the abstract is not included in section numbering). Use this numbering  also for internal cross-referencing: do not  just refer to &lsquo;the text&rsquo;.  Any subsection may be given a brief  heading. Each heading  should appear on its own separate &nbsp;line. </p>
      <p><b>Introduction<br>
      </b>State the objectives of the work  and provide an adequate background, avoiding a detailed literature survey or a  summary of the results. </p>
      <p><b>Material  and methods </b>
        <br>
      Provide sufficient detail to allow the work to  be re- produced.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Methods&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; already&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  published&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;be indicated by a reference. Only relevant modifications should be described. </p>
      <p><b>Theory/calculation<br>
      </b>A Theory section should extend,  not repeat, the back- ground to the article already  dealt with in the Introduction and lay the foundation for  further work. In contrast, a Calculation section represents a practical  development from a theoretical basis. </p>
      <p><b>Results </b>
        <br>
      Results should be clear and concise. </p>
      <p><b>Discussion <br>
      </b>This should explore the significance of the results  of the work, not repeat them. A combined  Results and Discussion section is often appropriate. Avoid extensive citations and discussion  of published literature. </p>
      <p><b>Conclusions<br>
      </b>The main conclusions of the study  may be presented in a short Conclusions section, which may stand alone or form  a subsection of a Discussion or Results and Discussion section. </p>
      <p><b>Appendices <br>
      </b>If there is more&nbsp; than&nbsp; one&nbsp; appendix,&nbsp; they&nbsp; should be identified  as A, B, etc. Formulae and equations in appendices should be given separate  numbering: Eq. (A.1), Eq. (A.2), etc.; in a subsequent appendix, Eq. (B.1) and  so on. This also applies to tables and figures: Table A.1; Fig. A.1, etc. </p>
      <p><b>Essential  title page information </b>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Title. </strong>Concise,  informative, and interesting. Titles are often used in information-retrieval  systems. Avoid abbreviations and  formulae where possible.</p>
      <p>          <strong>Author </strong><strong>names and  affiliations. </strong>Please clearly indicate  the given name(s) and family name(s) of each author and check that all names are accurately  spelled. Present the authors&rsquo; affiliation addresses  (where the actual work was done) below  the names. Indicate all  affiliations with a lower-case superscript number  immediately after the  author&rsquo;s name  and in front of the  appropriate address. Provide the full  postal address of each affiliation, including the country  name and, if available, the e-mail address  of each author.</p>
      <p>          <strong>Corresponding author. </strong>Clearly indicate who will handle correspondence at all stages of  refereeing, publication, and post-publication. Ensure that the e-mail address  is given and that contact details  are kept up to date by the corresponding author.</p>
      <p><strong>Present/permanent </strong><strong>address. </strong>If an author has  moved since the work described in the article was  done, or was visiting  at the time, a &lsquo;Present address&rsquo; (or &lsquo;Permanent  address&rsquo;) may be indicated as  a&nbsp; footnote to that author&rsquo;s name.  The address at which the author  actually did the work must be retained as the  main, affiliation address. Superscript  Arabic numerals are used for  such footnotes. </p>
      <p><b>Abstract<br>
      </b>A concise and factual abstract is required. The abstract  should state briefly the purpose  of the research, the principal  results and major conclusions. An abstract is often presented separately from  the article, so it must be  able to stand alone. For this  reason, References should be  avoided, but if essential,  then cite the author(s) and  year(s). Also, non-standard  or uncommon abbreviations should be avoided, but if essential they must be defined  at their first mention in the abstract itself. </p>
      <p><b>Keywords </b>
        <br>
      Immediately after the abstract,  provide a maximum&nbsp;&nbsp; of 6 keywords, using  American spelling and avoiding general and plural terms and multiple concepts  (avoid, for example, &lsquo;and&rsquo;, &lsquo;of &rsquo;). Be sparing with abbreviations: only  abbreviations firmly established in the field may be eligible. These keywords  will be used for indexing purposes. </p>
      <p><b>Abbreviations <br>
      </b>Define  abbreviations that  are not standard in this  field in a footnote to be placed on the first page of  the article. Such abbreviations that are unavoidable in the abstract  must be de- fined at their first mention there, as well as in the footnote. Ensure consistency of abbreviations throughout the article. </p>
      <p><b>Acknowledgements<br>
      </b>Collate acknowledgements in a  separate section at the end of the article before the references and do not,  there- fore, include them on the title page, as a footnote to the title or otherwise. List here those  individuals who provided help during the research (e.g., providing language  help, writing assistance or proof reading the article, etc.), as well as institutions and funding  agencies. </p>
      <p><b>Units<br>
      </b>Follow internationally accepted  rules and conventions: use the international system of units (SI). If other units are  mentioned, please give their equivalent in SI. </p>
      <p><b>Math  formulae </b>
        <br>
      Please submit math  equations as editable text and not as images. Present  simple formulae in line with normal text where possible and use the solidus  (/) instead of a horizontal line for  small fractional terms, e.g., X/Y. In  principle, variables are to be presented  in italics. Powers of e are often  more conveniently denoted by exp. Number consecutively  any equations that have to be displayed separately from the text (if referred to explicitly in  the text). </p>
      <b>Electronic artwork</b>
      <p><strong>General points</strong> </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure you use uniform lettering and sizing of your  original artwork. </li>
        <li>Preferred  fonts: Arial (or Helvetica), Times New Roman (or Times), Symbol, Courier. </li>
        <li>Number the illustrations according to their sequence  in the text. </li>
        <li>Use a logical naming convention for your artwork  files. </li>
        <li>For Word submissions only, you may provide figures, their captions, and tables within a single file at the revision stage. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Formats</strong> <br>
        Regardless of the application  used, when your electronic artwork is finalized, please &lsquo;save as&rsquo; or convert the images  to one of the following formats (note the resolution requirements for line drawings,  halftones, and line/halftone combinations given below): </p>
      <ul>
        <li>EPS  (or PDF): Vector drawings. Embed the  font or save the text as &lsquo;graphics&rsquo;. </li>
        <li>TIFF  (or JPG): Color or grayscale photographs (half- tones): always use a minimum of  300 dpi. </li>
        <li>TIFF  (or JPG): Bitmapped line drawings: use a mini- mum of 1000 dpi. </li>
        <li>TIFF (or JPG): Combined bitmapped line/half-tone (color or grayscale) images: a minimum of 500 dpi is required. <strong>Please do not:</strong> </li>
        <li>Supply files  that are optimized for screen use (e.g., GIF, BMP, PICT,  WPG); the resolution is too low. </li>
        <li>Supply files that are  too low in resolution. </li>
        <li>Submit  graphics that are disproportionately large for the content. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Color artwork<br>
      </b>Please make sure that artwork  files are in an acceptable format &mdash;  TIFF (or JPEG), EPS (or PDF), or MS Office files &mdash; and with the correct  resolution. If, together with your  accepted article, you submit usable color figures, the- se will appear in color online. </p>
      <p><b>Figure captions </b>
        <br>
      Ensure that each  illustration has a caption. A caption should comprise a brief title (not on the  figure itself ) and a description of  the illustration. Keep text in the illustrations to a minimum,  but be sure to explain  all symbols and abbreviations used. </p>
      <p><b>Tables<br>
      </b>Please submit tables as editable  text and not as images. Tables can be  placed either next to the relevant text in the article, or on separate page(s)  at the end. Number tables consecutively in accordance with their appearance in  the text and place any table  notes below the table body. Be spa-  ring in the use of tables and ensure that the data presented in them do not duplicate  results described elsewhere  in the article. Please avoid  using vertical rules. </p>
      <p><b>Citation  in text </b>
        <br>
      Please ensure that every reference cited in the text is also  present in the reference list (and vice versa). Any references cited  in the abstract must be given in full. Unpublished results and personal  communications are not recommended in the reference list,  but may be mentioned in the text. If these references are included in  the reference list they should follow the standard reference style of the  journal and should include a substitution of the publication date with either  &lsquo;Unpublished results&rsquo; or &lsquo;Personal communication&rsquo;. Citation of a reference as &lsquo;in press&rsquo; implies that the  item has been accepted for publication. </p>
      <p><b>Web references<br>
      </b>As a minimum, the full URL should  be given and the date when the reference was last accessed. Any further in-  formation, if known (DOI, author names, dates, reference to a source  publication, etc.), should also be given. Web references can be listed separately  (e.g., after the reference list) under a different heading  if desired, or can be included  in the reference list. </p>
      <p><b>Reference formatting</b><br>
      There are no strict requirements  on reference format- ting at submission. References can be in any style or format  as long as the style is consistent. Where applicable, name(s) of author(s), journal title/book  title, chapter title/article title,  year of publication, volume number/book chapter and the pagination must be present. Use of DOI is highly  encouraged. The reference style used by the journal will be applied to the accepted  article by SCIELO  at the proof stage. Note  that missing data will be highlighted at proof  stage for the author to correct. </p>
      <p><strong>Reference style</strong><b><br>
        </b>All publications  cited in the text should be presented in a list of references following the  text of the manuscript. In the text  refer to the author&rsquo;s name (without initials) and year of publication&nbsp; (e.g.&nbsp;  &ldquo;Since&nbsp; Almeida&nbsp; (1986)&nbsp; has shown that...&rdquo; or &ldquo;This is in&nbsp; agreement&nbsp;  with&nbsp; results obtained later  (Trompette 1994; Heilbron and Machado 2003).&rdquo; <br>
        For three or more authors use the first author followed by &ldquo;et al.&rdquo;, in the text.  The list of references should be arranged alphabetically by authors&rsquo; names. The  manuscript should be carefully checked to ensure that the spelling of authors&rsquo; names  and dates are exactly the same in the text as  in the reference list. <br>
        References should be given in the following form:      </p>

      <p><b>Articles  with accelerated review process </b>
        <br>
      An accelerated review process  may be requested for  complete original studies, for which urgency of publication is  adequately justified. At the discretion of the editors, these can be programmed for the first  available edition.  They must follow the same format described  for original articles. </p>
      <p><b>Editorials <br>
      </b>Editorials should cover some  aspect of the broad spectrum of the Geological Sciences. They will be  authored&nbsp; by the editors of BJG, by  people linked to the Brazilian Geological Society or by industry personalities.  These documents will not be submitted to peer review and will be published at  the discretion of the editors. </p>
      <p><b>Review articles </b> <br>
      Review articles  should cover relevant  topics of Geology.  These articles may be requested by the editors, but recognized experts  may spontaneously submit review articles&nbsp;  in their field of expertise. In this case, potential authors should  contact the editors to ascertain their interest prior to submitting the article</p>
