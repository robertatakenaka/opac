      <p><strong>Urbe </strong>accepts scientific articles with theoretical and  empirical studies of issues related to urban management but also to the broader  field of urban studies, promoting an interdisciplinary debate on urban  management using research outcomes as well as theoretical and empirical  discussions from diverse thematic areas.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>EDITORIAL POLICY</strong></p>
      <p>a) Papers must be submitted through our online system,  available at <strong><a href="http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/urbe-scielo" target="_blank">http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/urbe-scielo</a></strong>. We will not  accept submissions by e-mail.</p>
      <p>b) Articles are firstly analyzed by editors and, if  they follow the norms for publication and are considered aligned to the  thematic areas of interest, they follow a double-blind reviewing process in  which the identity of both the reviewer and author are concealed from both  parties.</p>
      <p>c) Referees will assess papers according journal&rsquo;s  norms, considering four possible results:<br>
        (1) accepted without revisions;<br>
        (2) conditional acceptance;<br>
        (3) re-submission; and<br>
        (4) rejected.</p>
      <p>d) The editors and referees reserve the right to  suggest changes and amendments to the originals, in order to keep the quality  of the publication, respecting, however, the style and the opinions of the  authors. Statements, opinions and concepts expressed in the articles are  authors&rsquo; entire responsibility.</p>
      <p>e) The submission of the paper to urbe implicate the  acceptance, by the author, of the norms expressed herein, as well as in the  authorization for their publication.</p>
      <p>f) The papers are published under Creative Commons  License, attribution-type BY, that allows &quot;others distribute, remix,  tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you  for the original creation&quot; (Creative Commons, 2013).</p>

      <p><strong>ETHICS, MALPRACTICE, AND PLAGIARISM DETECTION</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Urbe</strong> praises for the integrity of knowledge building,  in agreement with ethical standards that are expected to be followed by all  involved parties throughout the editorial process: authors, editors, reviewers  and publishers. The journal utilizes tools for detecting plagiarism, under the  responsibility of Editora Champagnat.</p>
      <p>We  believe that academic peer-reviewed journals must have a serious commitment  with transparency in the processes involved in selecting and publishing  research papers, as well as with the assurance that what is published is  accurate, trustworthy, and produced according to ethical standards of the  scientific community. This must be pursued by all parties mentioned above at  all stages of the publication process, and at <strong>urbe</strong>, we are dedicated to achieve this level of commitment. For  this, we follow the industry associations, such as the Committee on Publication  Ethics (COPE), based in the UK, that provide guidelines for best practices in scholarly  publishing.

When several papers by the same author  are cited in the same entry, separate the years by commas [e.g., Rabelo, 2000,  2001a, 2001b, 2003]; and when several papers of different authors are cited in  the same entry, separate each citation with a semicolon [e.g., (Rabelo, 1993;  Tadmor &amp; Gogos, 1979; Assis et al., 2014)].<br>
        <u>- Direct citation:</u> The phrase  should appear within quotation marks, indicating the page from where it was  taken immediately after the citation [e.g., As Ferrara wrote (2003, p. 37)  &quot;thinking is based on the construction of language&quot;...].

        <u>- Citation of verbal information:</u> When literal, it should appear within quotation marks and indicate, in  parentheses, the expression &ldquo;verbal information&rdquo;, mentioning the date [e.g.,  According to Jo&atilde;o Silva (verbal information; October 10, 2005)...].</p>
