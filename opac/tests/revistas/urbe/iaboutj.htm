  <td width="70%"><p><strong>Urbe</strong> praises for the integrity of the knowledge  building, in  agreement with ethical standards that are expected  to be  followed by all involved parties throughout the editorial  process:  authors, editors, reviewers and publishers. The journal utilizes tools for  detecting plagiarism, under the responsibility of Editora Champagnat.</p>
    <p> We believe  that academic peer-reviewed journals must have a serious commitment with  transparency in the processes involved in selecting and publishing research  papers, as well as with the assurance that what is published is accurate,  trustworthy, and produced according to ethical standards of the scientific  community. This must be pursued by all parties mentioned above at all stages of  the publication process, and at <strong>urbe</strong>, we are dedicated to achieve this  level of commitment. For this, we follow the industry associations, such as the  Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), based in the UK, that provides  guidelines for best practices in scholarly publishing. At <strong>urbe</strong>,  responsibilities and procedures must meet the following standards.</p>
    <p><strong>1. Editors:</strong> <br>
      - have  complete responsibility and authority to reject/accept an article;<br>
      - must  preserve anonymity of reviewers;<br>
      - must have  no conflict of interest with respect to articles/authors/sponsors they manage  during the editorial process, and must handle all submissions equally,  independently of external sponsorship and support;<br>
      - must be  vigilant and committed to preserve internationally recognized standards of  ethics in scholarly publishing;<br>
      - have to  investigate any claims of error or malpractice, giving voice to all parties  involved;<br>
      - must  react as quickly as possible to malpractice and plagiarism &ndash; correcting,  retracting and apologizing &ndash; in order to preserve the integrity of the people  and institutions affected.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Authors:</strong> <br>
      - have to  assert that the article in submission is not under consideration or accepted  for publication elsewhere;<br>
      - must  confirm that all authors have actively participated in the discussions  presented in the article;<br>
      - must  confirm that all authors have revised and approved the submitted version of the  manuscript;<br>
      - have to  respond to requests and demands by the editorial team in the peer- review  process;<br>
      - have to  respond to enquires in case of any suspicion of errors and malpractice, and be  prepared to correct, retract and apologize if found guilty of unethical  behavior (such as plagiarism and fraudulent data);<br>
      - must  notify the editorial team if a significant error in their paper is found; <br>
      - have to  declare any potential conflicts of interest.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Reviewers:</strong> <br>
      - must not  disclosure any information about the paper outside the editorial team and the  processes of peer-review, and must not retain any copy of the article under review;<br>
      - must  agree in supporting the peer-review process as objectively and timely as  possible, in order to assure high quality of the published material;<br>
      - must be  clear about and declare any possible conflict of interest with respect to  articles/authors/sponsors;<br>
      - have to  inform the editorial team of any published or submitted content that is  substantially similar to that under review.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Publisher:</strong> <br>
      - Editora  Champagnat must ensure that good practice is maintained to the standards  outlined above;<br>
      - have to  assist the editorial team safeguarding the ethical standards of this  publication;<br>
      - must be  vigilant against any malpractice and committed to take the necessary measures  of correcting, retracting and apologizing in cases where errors and breaches  are identified.</p>
    <p><strong>5. Actions following malpractice:</strong> <br>
      - unethical  behavior may be identified and brought to the attention of the editorial team  and publisher at any time, by anyone;<br>
      -  sufficient evidence must be provided in order for an investigation to be  initiated;<br>
      - editors  and publisher can initiate an investigation at any time, but must avoid  spreading allegations before confirming errors and malpractices;<br>
      - all  parties involved in an alleged malpractice must be informed about the steps of  an investigation and possible consequences;<br>
      - all  parties should be given the opportunity to respond to any allegations; <br>
    - in cases where a  misconduct is found, outcomes include the following options, that can be  cumulative depending on the seriousness of the situation: (a) informing the  parties where there appears to be a misunderstanding; (b) a formal letter to  the parties explaining the errors and warning for future malpractice; (c)  formal retraction of a paper from the journal with appropriate apologies to  people or institutions affected; (d) reporting the case and outcome to possible  higher authorities (including sponsors and the authors&rsquo; empolyers) for further  investigation and action.</p></td>
