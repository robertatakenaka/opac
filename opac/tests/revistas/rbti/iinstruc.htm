      <p>Revista  Brasileira de Terapia Intensiva (RBTI), ISSN 0103-507X, is the scientific  journal of the Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o de Medicina Intensiva Brasileira (AMIB) and Sociedade  Portuguesa de Cuidados Intensivos quarterly issued scientific journal. It aims to publish relevant research  involving acutely ill patients health care improvement, providing discussion,  distribution and promotion of evidence-based information to intensive care  professionals. It publishes research, review, comments, case report articles  and letters to the Editor, involving all areas of knowledge related to  intensive care of the critically ill patient.</p>
      <p>RBTI  endorses the recommendations from International Committee of Medical Journal  Editors - Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical  Journals, updated in April 2010, available in <a href="http://www.icmje.org/urm_main.html" target="_blank">http://www.icmje.org/urm_main.html.</a></p>
    <p>Any contribution submitted to RBTI must be original and the manuscript, or parts of it, must not be under consideration by any other journal. Also, authors should not submit the same manuscript in different languages to different journals. Authors should declare any potentially overlapping publications on submission for editor assessment and evaluation. We submit manuscripts to plagiarism detection tools in order to detect any duplication, overlapping publication or misconduct, and whenever any of these situations is detected, the Editor should contact the authors ant its institution. If editor detects such situation, authors should expect prompt rejection of the submitted manuscript. If the editor was not aware of the situation previously to acceptance of the manuscript, then it will be retracted in a further edition of the Journal.</p>

      <p>The manuscripts can be submitted  either in English, Portuguese or Spanish. RBTI is published in a Portuguese  printed version and a Portuguese and English electronic version. 
      <p> No  fee for evaluation or publication of the manuscripts will be charged to the  authors.       
    <p> The journal will translate the  articles submitted in Portuguese (or Spanish) and the translation costs will be  covered by the journal. Articles submitted in English will be translated by the  journal into Portuguese, with no expenses to the authors. All articles must be  electronically submitted at: <a href="http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/rbti-scielo" target="_blank">http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/rbti-scielo</a>     
    <p><strong>Authors should submit to the journal:</strong>    
    <p><em><strong>Cover letter</strong></em><em><strong> </strong></em><strong>-</strong> It should contain a declaration  stating that the article is original, has not been or is not being submitted  for publication in another journal. Authors should also state that the study  was approved by the Research Ethics Committee (REC) of the institution where  the study was conducted (or a reference REC), mentioning the number of  registration and, if appropriate, a statement that informed consent was  obtained or exempted by the REC. If required, during the peer review process,  authors might be asked to send a copy of REC approval. <br>
        <br>
        <em><strong>Declaration of Conflict of Interest</strong></em><strong>- </strong>Authors should download the appropriate form,  (available from:  http://www.rbti.org.br/imagebank/pdf/Disclosure_of_Potential_Conflits.pdf) and,  after signature of the authors, upload it during the submission process. This  declaration, according to resolution of the Federal Medical Council No.  1595/2000, prohibits scientific paper to promote or advertise any commercial  products or equipment. 
    <p><em><strong>Funding </strong></em><strong><em>-</em></strong> Information of possible sources of funding for  research will be required during the submission process as well as in the title  page of the manuscript<strong>.</strong><br>
        <br>
        <em><strong>Copyright transfer</strong></em><em><strong>and publication  authorization </strong></em><strong><em>-</em></strong>After  acceptance, a authorization signed by all authors to publish and a copyright  transfer to the journal should be sent to Journal office (available from:  http://www.rbti.org.br/imagebank/pdf/authors_responsability_and_copyright_transfer.pdf). <br>
        <br>
        <em><strong>Patient's information</strong></em><strong><em> -</em></strong> For all manuscripts that include information or clinical photographs in which  patients can be individually identified, a writing consent signed by each  patient or his family should be sent.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Peer review process </strong><br>
      All manuscripts submitted to RBTI  are subject to rigorous review. The initial submissions are reviewed by  internal staff to ensure adherence to <em>RBTI </em>policies, including ethical  requirements for human and animal experimentation. After this initial  evaluation, the article can be send back to the authors for adequacy. <br>
      Afterwards, the submitted  manuscripts will be evaluated checked by the Editor. Manuscripts without merit,  bearing significant methodology errors, or not fitting the journals editorial  policy will be rejected, without a formal peer review process. Our average  turn-around time for this immediate rejection is one week. <br>
      After the Editor-in-chiefs (or a  designated editor) approval, the articles will be forwarded to two or more  reviewers. They will always be from institutions different from the one the  manuscript is from, being the anonymous condition kept during the entire  editorial process. Our average turn-around time for the first answer to the  authors is 30 days although a longer time might be required. After evaluation,  the editors will choose between the following decisions: accept, minor  revision, major revision, rejected and resubmit or reject. RBTI's acceptance  rate is approximately 30%. In the past 12 months, the median time from  submission to first decision for all articles was 28 days. <br>
      After receiving the reviewers  opinion, the authors should submit the revised version within 60 days including  the suggested changes together with a point-to-point answer to each reviewer.  Authors may contact RBTI (rbti.artigos@amib.org.br) if they require an  extension. If not submitted within 6 months, the manuscript will be removed  from the data base and an eventual resubmission will follow the initial  submissions track. Upon resubmission, the editors may choose to send the  manuscript back to external reviewers, or may render a decision based on  personal expertise.</p>
    <p>The opinions expressed in the  articles, including reviewer-requested changes, will be the only authors  responsibility. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Ethics</strong><br>
      When reporting experiments on human subjects, authors should indicate whether  the procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the  responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national, if  applicable) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000. When  reporting experiments on animals, authors should be asked to indicate whether  the institutional and national guide for the care and use of laboratory animals  was followed. In any either clinical or experimental, human or animal studies  these information should be placed in the section Methods.<br>
      Revista Brasileira de Terapia  Intensiva ethical statements can be found in our website (http://www.rbti.org.br/eticas.asp).</p>
