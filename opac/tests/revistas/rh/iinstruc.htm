    <p><strong>Revista de Hist&oacute;ria</strong> (RH) publishes articles, reviews and critical editions of sources and documents, related preferably to THE SUBJECT OF History, but also to other similar subjects, such as Anthropology, Sociology, and Archaeology.</p>
    <p>The contributions must be original, unpublished and written in Portuguese or, in special cases, in Spanish.</p>
    <p>The reviews must be of books published in Brazil during the previous two years, counted from the date of submission of the review, or, if published abroad, during the previous four years, counted the same way. Each contributor can submit only one manuscript for review at a time, that is, between the onset of the submission and the final publication. Further, there must also be a two-year interval for the same contributor to publish another text in RH. In case the text is withdrawn after the beginning of the evaluation process, the author must also wait for two years before submitting another manuscript. </p>
    <p>Once the texts are accepted for publication, Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo, Faculdade de Filosofia, Letras e Ci&ecirc;ncias Humanas, Departamento de Hist&oacute;ria become the owners of copyrights and publishing rights of them.  The views presented in the contributions published by Revista de Hist&oacute;ria are under the exclusive responsibility of their respective authors. </p>
    <p>The authors who have their contribution published will receive by mail three RH copies in which their text is published.</p>
    <p>Since that meet formal specifications, the proposed contributions (articles, reviews, and critical editions of sources and documents) they will be submitted to an initial screening, carried out by the Executive Editors.</p>
    <p>After the first screening, the texts enter the review process, when they are subjected by two ad hoc reviewers (experts in the field or issues concerned with minimal doctor title) designated by the Executive Editors process, thus ensuring the evaluative system of double blind.</p>
    <p>Subsequently, the opinions and text are assessed jointly by the Executive Editors meeting. When there are conflicting opinions, a third ad hoc referee will be sought. This assessment will result in approval or disapproval of the texts, as well as the request to the author to do revisions that respond in part or in full to the criticisms and suggestions of the referees. If this request for reformulation occurs, the author will have 30 days to submit a new version of the text, which will be re-evaluated, both by the Executive Editors and by referees who suggested changes.</p>
    <p>The Journal adopts Similarity Check system for identifying plagiarism.</p></td>
