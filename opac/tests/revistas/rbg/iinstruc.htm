      <p>The <b>Revista Brasileira de Geofísica</b> (<b>RBGf - Brazilian Journal 
        of Geophysics</b>) is published four times a year by the <a
  href="http://www.sbgf.org.br/">Sociedade Brasileira de Geofísica</a> (SBGf - 
        <a
  href="http://www.sbgf.org.br/english">Brazilian Geophysical Society</a>). Its 
        main objective is the diffusion at national and international levels, 
        especially in the Iberian language countries, of technical and original 
        articles in the areas of Solid Earth Geophysics, Space Geophysics and 
        Applied Geophysics. </p>
      <p>The journal also publishes works in areas such as Atmospheric Sciences, 
        Oceanography, Geodesy, Tectonophysics among other related fields.</p>
      <p>In addition to full scientific articles and short communications, the 
        <b>RBGf</b> publishes the <b>Boletim Sísmico Brasileiro</b> and the <b>Boletim 
        Geomagnético do Observatório Nacional</b>, as well as a variety of other 
        articles related to Geophysics: analyses, syntheses, debates, reviews, 
        translations, abstracts of theses and dissertations, news, correspondences, 
        etc.</p>
      <p>Editorial work is fulfilled by the Editorial Board, Division Associate 
        Editors, <a

      <p>1. It will only be accepted for publication in the <b>Revista Brasileira 
        de Geofísica</b> (<b>RBGf - Brazilian Journal of Geophysics</b>) original 
        geophysical papers and correlated areas, not previously published, or 
        in publishing process. However, it will be permitted re-publications of 
        papers of recognized scientific value. 
      <p>2. The papers shall be written in Portuguese, English or Spanish. In 
        any case, one abstract in English and another in Portuguese or Spanish 
        must be included along with the correspondent titles and keywords.</p>
      <p>3. All submitted manuscripts shall be sent in four full copies (double 
        space) to the Brazilian Geophysical Society at the address below.</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Avenida Rio Branco, # 156 room 2509<br>
          Rio de Janeiro – RJ<br>
          Zip Code: 20040-003<br>
          Brazil </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>4. The papers shall be prepared in a style that the first page contains 
        the title of the paper, the author's full name, the author's institution(s) 
        and mailing address. The second page shall include the English and the 
        Portuguese abstracts and the contents of the paper specified in items, 
        as well as the number of included figures and tables. Manuscripts should 
        be submitted in MS-Word or in LaTeX, using the article style.</p>
      <p>5. The keywords must consist of three to five terms separated by comma 
        and should not repeat words already used in the title. Capital letters 
        should be used only when orthographic rules require.</p>
      <p>6. Tables and figures shall be appended at the end of the text preceded 
        by a sheet containing the respective captions. Do not insert captions 
        on the figures nor in the tables. Inside the main text the spaces where 
        the figures and the tables should be inserted shall be indicated. The 
        figure and table captions should be written in the original language.</p>
      <p>7. Footnotes shall be placed at the bottom of the page where they will 
        be indicated.</p>
      <p>8. Figures will be printed in maximum dimensions of 18cm x 24cm. Hence, 
        the originals shall be prepared considering possible reductions, in such 
        a case that the details, symbols and letters do not vanish after the reduction. 
        Authors should consider that the size of characters after reduction cannot 
        be less than 1mm. Figures that do not follow the standards of the journal 
        will be returned to authors for review.</p>
      <p>9. Figures shall be presented in digital files or opaque paper or good 
        quality white paper, or in white-and-black photographs. Figures shall 
        be presented in digital archives (CD-ROM), in high resolution (300 dpi). 
        Exceptionally color photographs will be accepted.</p>
      <p>10. Subtitles should be positioned on the left margin and should be formatted 
        as below:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><br>
          <b>INTRODUCTION<br>
          METHODOLOGY<br>
          Theoretical Revision</b></p>
        <p><b>Laboratory Measurements</b></p>
        <p><b>RESULTS</b></p>
        <p><b>DISCUSSION<br>
          CONCLUSION<br>
          APENDIX<br>
          ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS<br>
          REFERENCES<br>
          </b><b>NOTES ABOUT THE AUTHORS</b></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>11. Tables must be auto-explicative and not too very long. The density 
        of information on the tables should take into account possible reductions.</p>
      <p>12. Authors shall supply clear instructions about the composition of 
        symbols in formulas and equations. Equations shall be sequentially numbered 
        in parenthesis right-justified on the line. Inside the main text they 
        must be referred to as &quot;Eq.(1)&quot;, &quot;Eqs.(2) and (3)&quot; 
        etc.</p>
      <p>13. Use International Measurement System Units whenever possible.</p>
      <p>14. Bibliographic References shall be alphabetically ordered by the surname 
        of the first author. When several references of the same author exist 
        they should firstly be referenced by the number of authors (in case of 
        same number of authors, alphabetical order prevails) and then by the date 
        of the paper in ascendent order. Examples:</p>
