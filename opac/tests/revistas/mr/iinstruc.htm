      <p><b>Language and style</b>: All submissions should be <u>in English</u>, 
        double spaced and typed on an A4 (209 x 296 mm) paper, with Times New 
        Roman font-size 12, and with ample (~2.5 cm) top, bottom and left-hand 
        margins. In general, the typescript for articles should follow the conventional 
        form: title, authors' names and complete affiliations, abstract, introduction, 
        literature review, experimental, simulation or calculation procedures, 
        results and discussion, conclusions, acknowledgments, references, tables, 
        figure captions, and figures. 
      <p><u>Letters</u> are restricted to reports of <u>unusual urgency, significance 
        or interest</u>, and should be limited to 1000 words or the equivalent. 
        A statement from the authors as to why the manuscript meets these criteria 
        will be helpful to the Editor. Letters will not be accepted if, in the 
        opinion of the Editor, the principal content has previously been released 
        or publicized in any other published medium. In estimating the length 
        of a Note, an average sized figure is counted as 100 words and separate 
        formulae and lines of a table are counted as 8 words per line, including 
        headings and horizontal rulings. The title, authors' names, and literature 
        references are not counted. 
      <p><b>Title</b>: This should be brief and convey the contents of the paper. 
      <p><b>Abstract</b>: An Abstract in English must be included. It should be 
        short, not more than 150 words for an Article and 50 words for Letters, 
        and should contain numerical and factual data only. 
      <p><b>Keywords</b>: The authors should indicate a minimum of three keywords. 
      <p><b>Illustrations</b>: All necessary illustrations should be   submitted with at least 300 dots per inch (600 dpi recommended). Graphs   and diagrams should be consecutively numbered in Arabic numerals in the   order in which they appear in the text. The submitted illustrations will   be reduced and directly reproduced in the published paper, so authors   should take particular care to ensure that all lettering of an   illustration (particularly the smallest ones) are clearly legible.   Figures should be sent in .jpg/jpeg, .tif, .png, etc file format. Images in .doc or .pdf files are   compressed and this makes them lose resolution, which is why it is so   important that they are sent in separate files. Complex or multi-panel   figures (namely with (a) and (b)) should be sent in one file instead of   separated (<a href="http://www.scielo.br/img/revistas/mr/v19n2//1516-1439-mr-1980-5373-MR-2015-0387-gf05.jpg" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=pt-BR&q=http://www.scielo.br/img/revistas/mr/v19n2//1516-1439-mr-1980-5373-MR-2015-0387-gf05.jpg&source=gmail&ust=1489587917647000&usg=AFQjCNEUBmQEYgDoTUposdI3IrdzoUieLg">example</a>).</p>
      <p><b>Tables</b>: Each table should be typed or printed on a separate sheet, 
        and should have a caption in addition to its sequence number.</p>
      <p><b>Photographs</b>: Photographs should be submitted with at least 300 
        dots per inch (600 dpi recommended), high contrast and positive. When 
        necessary, the scale should be drawn on the photograph itself, and not 
        below. Color photographs may be published at additional cost. 
      <p><b>Captions for figures</b>: These should give sufficient information 
        to make the illustration comprehensible. 
      <p><b>Bibliography</b>: The references should be in accordance with the standard Vancouver (see examples below). Reference numbers in the text should be typed as superscripts without parentheses. The literature cited should be printed 
        on a separate page (double-spaced), and should be listed in the order 
      in which it appears in the text.</p>

      <p><strong>Peer Review</strong>: The articles will be evaluated by at least two reviewers, Brazilian or foreign researchers, of proven scientific reputation, invited by the editors according to their field of knowledge. After corrections and reassessment, articles will be accepted if they have two favourable opinions, and are rejected when they receive two unfavourable opinions. In specific cases, the editor may decide to accept or reject an article based on only one opinion if it is well founded.</p>
      <p><b>Function of Referees</b>: The Editor seeks the advice of experts in 
        the research areas of the submitted manuscripts. Referees should estimate 
        the <u>originality, soundness and scientific value</u> of the work, together 
        with some basis for their opinion. They should also indicate whether the 
        writing is clear and concise. Improperly used space merely restricts the 
        amount of useful material which can be published. The Editor, who accepts 
        full responsibility for decisions about manuscripts, may not always follow 
        the recommendations from the referees. Papers which are not accepted by 
        the Editor will be returned to the authors, and there will be no communication 
      about them with the editors of other journals.</p>
<p><b>General Considerations</b>: Authors should present their materials 
        with the utmost conciseness and clarity. Extensive reviews of the literature 
        cannot be accepted, however, the <u>state-of-art</u> on the specific subject 
        covered by the article must be clearly stated. Well-known procedures should 
        either be designated by name or literature references. Notes acknowledging 
        technical assistance for the research or indicating presentation at a 
        meeting should be brief. The name of the author to whom inquiries about 
        the paper may be addressed should be marked with an asterisk. The authors' 
        official titles should not be included. The submitting author must provide  an ORCID ID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID, <a href="http://orcid.org/" target="_blank">http://orcid.org/</a>)  at the time of submission by entering it in the user profile in the submission  system. We strongly encourage coauthors to do the same. Introductions should contain only 
        enough background material to show <u>why the work was done and why it 
        is worth publishing</u>. This information should also be addressed in 
        the cover letter sent to the editor.</p>
      <p>Experimental results are of lasting value and should be clearly and logically 
        presented in a separate section. Results and discussions should be sequential. 
        The addition of a final section at the end of the paper, which briefly 
        summarizes the main conclusions of the work, is recommended.<br>
      </p>
      <p><b>General Instructions</b>: Contributions will only be considered for 
        publication when submitted in our online submission website located at <a href="https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/mr-scielo" target="_blank">https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/mr-scielo</a>. 
        File types accepted for submission: .doc and .docx to manuscripts and .jpg/jpeg, .tiff and .png to images. The first page should contain the title and authors' 
        names and addresses, the title, the abstract and the keywords. The text 
        should start on the second page. All pages of the manuscript should be 
        numbered consecutively, including references and notes, tables, figure 
        captions and figures, which should be presented in this sequence. The 
        submission should also include the original graphs, drawings of apparatus, 
        and structural formulae. The authors should indicate in the text itself 
        or in marginal notes in the typescript where the tables and figures are 
        to be inserted.</p>
      <p>The attention of contributors is particularly directed to the requirement 
        that all nomenclature should be consistent, clear, unambiguous, and conform 
        to the rules of nomenclature established by the International Union of 
        Pure and Applied Chemistry, the International Union of Biochemistry, the 
        Abstracts Service (see Index Guide to Chemical Abstracts, 1987), the Nomenclature 
        Committee of the American Chemical Society, or other appropriate bodies.</p>
      <p><b>Galley Proofs and Reprints</b>: Galley proofs are provided for the 
        correction of printing errors. The correction of proofs should not be 
        used for improvement in the language or substance of the paper. The cost 
        of changes considered to be excessive will be charged to the author(s). 
        If changes in the conclusions are necessary due to work done or published 
        since the manuscript was prepared, it is preferable that a brief Note 
        Added in Proof be prepared. Corrected galley proofs should be returned 
        promptly, preferably within 48 hours by e-mail or as instructed by the 
        desktop publishing company. Since page charges have been eliminated, authors 
        are not entitled to free reprints. A reprint order form is sent to the 
        corresponding author if requested to.</p>
      <p><b>Desktop Publication</b>: <strong>Materials Research Ibero-american Journal of Materials</strong> is published by 
        a desktop publishing process. Authors are requested to prepare their papers 
        using word processors. After being accepted for publication, the final 
        corrected version should be sent by e-mail or as instructed by the editorial 
        board.</p>
