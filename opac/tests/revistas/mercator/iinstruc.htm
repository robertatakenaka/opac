    <td width="70%"><p>MERCATOR has as target audience researchers of physiography and human geography, as well as related sciences.</p>
      <p>The double-blind evaluation process is the one implemented on MERCATOR. To ensure the integrity of the double-blind evaluation, the authors, as well as reviewers, must take all possible measures to not reveal their identities in the evaluation process. This requires that authors, editors and evaluators (liable to send documents to the system, as part of the evaluation process) take some precautions with the text and the properties of the document.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The authors of the document must remove from the text their names, replacing with &ldquo;Author&rdquo; and the year in references and footnotes, instead of author names, article title, etc.</li>
        <li>In Microsoft Office documents, the identification of the author must be removed from the properties of the document (in the File menu &gt; Properties), starting at File, in the main menu, and clicking in sequence: File &gt; Save as&hellip; &gt; Tools (or Options on Mac) &gt; Security &gt; Remove personal information from this file on save &gt; OK &gt; Save.</li>
        <li>In PDF files, the names of the authors must be removed from the properties as well, in File on the main menu of Acrobat Reader.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In accordance to the method in focus, each article presented to the journal for publishing, will be evaluated by at least two scientific advisors, or if the thematic imposes the participation of ad hoc consultants (external evaluators), upon which the Editorial Board will accept, reject or even request changes.</p>
      <p>In case of conflicting opinions, it will be referred to a third appraiser or external evaluator who shall resolve the doubts about the property or impropriety of the publication of the article, taking into account only its academic quality.<br>
        The cited evaluators will base its analysis on a form available on the platform addressing the terms below:</p>
      <p>I. The title of the article is appropriate and represents the smallest summary of its contents?</p>
      <p>II. Suitable summaries describe the objective, indicate theoretical referential, methods, main results and conclusions?</p>
      <p>III. Content evaluation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Relevance of the article to the scientific field;</li>
        <li>Originality of the article;</li>
        <li>Property and quality of the methodology used;</li>
        <li>Representation, consistency and theoretical articulation and methodology for data analysis;</li>
        <li>Foundation and consistency of findings;</li>
        <li>Quality of writing and organization of text;</li>
        <li>Scientific rigor and obedience to the ABNT rules;</li>
        <li>Relevance, quality and clarity of the figures and tables.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After evaluation of the terms above the manuscript will receive, based on the assessments, the following recommendations: accept, mandatory corrections, resubmit for review, send to another journal or reject.</p>
      <p>The editor will inform each of the writers on the state of the manuscript and, if accepted and having fulfilled the requests made by the reviewers and the editors, initiate the process of publishing the work aiming to publish it on the platform.</p>
      <p>In the meantime it becomes essential the involvement of the author in meeting the demands related to the formatting of the article, with greater emphasis related to the graphical quality of the material related to additional documents (pictures, tables and graphs).</p>
      <p>In order to improve the quality of the graphic elements and clarity of figures, our responsible for the layout of the journal will thoroughly evaluate the documents and can suggest changes, additions, complements, reformatting and deleting material not suited to the demands of MERCATOR. Failure to meet the demands will justify the archiving of the submission on our platform.</p>
      <p>There are no fees for submission and review articles.</p>
