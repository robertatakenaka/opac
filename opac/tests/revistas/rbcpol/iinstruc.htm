      <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Revista Brasileira de  Ci&ecirc;ncia Pol&iacute;tica</strong>&nbsp;publishes original articles related to politics from varying theoretical and  methodological perspectives. The journal is  particularly interested in publishing methodologically rigorous work.</p>
      <p> The journal  publishes articles that are positively evaluated by peers and the editorial  committee. Papers submited must be original work and should not be under review  at any other journal.</p>
      <p>The <strong>Revista Brasileira de Ci&ecirc;ncia Pol&iacute;tica</strong> adopts a double-brlind  review process. The journal takes a decision about publication based on at least two  peer reviews. The review process takes about 4 months on average.</p>
      <p>Articles  submitted to the <strong>Revista Brasileira de  Ci&ecirc;ncia Pol&iacute;tica </strong>are evaluated according to their relevance for the field  of political science, the extent to which they are inovative, methodologically  rigorous and clearly written.</p>
      <p>The <strong>Revista Brasileira de Ci&ecirc;ncia Pol&iacute;tica </strong>also  publishes reviews of books published in the last 36 months. Book reviews are  evaluated by the editorial committee based on two criteria: (i) the book review  falls within the scope of interest of the journal; and (ii) is judged relevant  to the discipline of political science. The book review editor is free to  request external peer evaluations if desired.</p>
    <p>Finally, note that both articles and book  reviews are either &ldquo;accepted for publication&rdquo;, &ldquo;invited to be revised and  resubmitted&rdquo;, or &ldquo;rejected.&rdquo; When rejected, articles and book reviews cannot be  resubmitted again.</p></td>

      <p>The <strong>Revista Brasileira de Ci&ecirc;ncia Pol&iacute;tica</strong> is committed to the norms defined by the  Committee for Integrity in Scientific Activity of Brazilian National Council  for Scientific and Technological Development (Comiss&atilde;o de Integridade na  Atividade Cient&iacute;fica do Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&iacute;fico e  Tecnol&oacute;gico &ndash; CNPq, <a href="http://www.cnpq.br/web/guest/diretrizes">http://www.cnpq.br/web/guest/diretrizes</a>) and is also guided by the directions for ethics in publication of the  Committee on Publication Ethics &ndash; COPE (<a href="http://publicationethics.org/" target="_blank">http://publicationethics.org/</a>).</p>
      <p>Guided by those sets of norms and directions, the editors have been  acting to prevent malpractices and anti-ethical behavior in the publishing of  articles, with special attention to prevent plagiarism, as it follows:<br>
  &nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>1. Publication and  authorship:</strong></p>
      <p>When authors submit their articles, they have to declare that their  content is original, that it has not been published or submitted to any other  publication, in any language. <br>
        All articles contain a list of references as well as institutions and  agencies that have financially supported research.<br>
        Norms related to plagiarism and fraudulent data are clearly announced  and authors have to declare their knowledge when submitting their paper.  Editors are permanently committed to avoid publication of plagiarism and  fraudulent data. Reviewers are also informed about national and international  rules, so that they act in concert with editors to avoid plagiarism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>2. Author&rsquo;s  responsibilities:</strong></p>
      <p>Authors  are academic researchers, engaged in serious and systematic work in their  specific fields and subfields. <br>
        Authors  signing the articles have, all of them, significantly contributed to the  research. <br>
        It is  author&rsquo;s responsibility to guarantee that all information and data in the  article that is being submitted is authentic. They have to state that all  information is authentic when submitting the article. <br>
        They  also have to point clearly institutions and research projects within which  their work has been developed, as well as the organizations that have conceded  financial support to their research.<br>
        It is author&rsquo;s responsibility to inform the editors in case they find  out any mistakes, incorrect data or misleading information. When submitting the  article, they agree to inform and correct any mistakes.<br>
        Authors are committed to work as reviewers for other articles in their  subfield of knowledge.&nbsp; </p>
      <p><strong>3. Peer  review and responsibility for the reviewers:</strong><br>
        Reviewers have a clear guide, received concomitantly to the article to  be reviewed, of the topics to be evaluated in any article and the pattern of  quality to be guaranteed. This guide keeps reviews objective and comparable. <br>
        Reviews evaluate relevance, correctness, originality, actuality of  discussions and references, adequacy to the field of knowledge, the rigor of methodology adopted and patterns of  quality of the publication.<br>
        When accepting to review an article, reviewers state that they have no  conflict of interests with respect to authors and research.<br>
      Reviews are strictly confidential.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Editorial  responsibilities:</strong><br>
        Editors analyze all articles received and have responsibility and  authority to reject or accept articles, based on referees. <br>
        Editors have responsibility to select reviewers appropriately,  considering the themes of the articles and the production and respectability of  academics considered as reviewers.<br>
        Editors have responsibility to guarantee patterns of quality accorded.<br>
        Editors have responsibility to prevent mal-practices and anti-ethical  behavior, specially plagiarism and fraudulent data.<br>
        Editors have responsibility to correct eventual mistakes, publishing  corrections or retraction.<br>
      Editors have responsibility to preserve permanently the anonymity of  reviewers as well as the anonymity of the authors of the articles under review. </p>
      <p><strong>5. Publishing  ethics issues</strong><strong> </strong><br>
        Clear guides concerning publishing ethics are  stated and accessible, so that authors and reviewers have knowledge of them:  articles have to be authentic and no fraudulent data or plagiarism is accepted. <br>
        Correction and quality are permanently  safeguarded, with a clear compromise to clarify, retract and correct any  mistakes by authors or resulting from editing process.</p>
      <p>Editorial board is permanently guided by these  statements, so that the conduct of editors safeguards publishing ethics</p>
