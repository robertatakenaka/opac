    <p>The  <strong>Bras. Political Sci. Rev</strong>.welcomes  submissions of articles, ongoing research notes and review essays from  political scientists and researchers from related disciplines. The scope of the  journal is broad as it accepts submissions representing the entire range of  political science research &ndash; theoretical or empirical, cross-national or  focused on a single-country, quantitative or qualitative. All articles are  subject to a blind peer review process.</p>
    <p>The BPSR  adopts an interval of 2 years for publishing two original works of the same  author in the same category - articles, research notes and review essays. This  rule does not apply to book reviews.</p>
    <p>Each  publication type is considered separately. This means for instance that  publishing an original article does not affect the possibility of its author to  publish a research note or a review essay within a two-years' time.</p>
This rule is applicable to all authors of an  original work, be them either the main author or the co-authors.</td>

      <p>Manuscripts  must be written in English, except for Brazilian authors, who may submit  originals in Portuguese.</p>
      <p>Manuscript  Formatting:</p>
      <p>The  following specifications must be used:</p>
      <p>Page  setup to standard A4 paper</p>
      <p>1.5  left and right margins</p>
      <p>1.5 line spacing </p>
      <p>Times New Roman font, 12 point </p>
      <p>BPSR adopts a norm adapted  from Chicago Humanities. Manuscripts should be arranged as follows:</p>
      TITLE PAGE: The title of the article should appear on  a separate, first page, containing the name(s) of the author(s), institutional  affiliation, e-mail address, and a full postal address of the author to whom  proofs and other correspondence should be sent. The title page should also  indicate the date the manuscript was submitted.
      <p>ABSTRACT PAGE: The abstract  should not exceed 250 words; this page should also provide 5 (five)  keywords.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>MAIN TEXT: Pages should be numbered consecutively from  1 and positioned at the upper right corner of the page. The manuscript text  should not exceed 35 pages, or approximately 10 thousand words. Research notes  and review essays should not exceed 10 pages or approximately 2.5 thousand  words. </p>
      <p>All headings should be  aligned along the left margin and be typewritten with capital initials; they should  not be underlined. </p>
      <p>All paragraphs must start at the left margin with  capital initials; they must be  left-justified and must not contain any marks or tabs (justifications). The  location of tables, graphs and figures should&nbsp;  be clearly indicated in the text and numbered sequentially altogether  (e.g., Table 1, Graph 2, Figure 3, Table 4, and so on).</p>
      <p>Titles of books and articles  appearing in the body of the text should be italicized. Titles should not be  abbreviated, except in the case of frequent reference. <br>
NOTES: Notes should be placed  at the end of the text and numbered consecutively. Notes are to be kept to a  minimum, limited to essential matters.&nbsp; <br>
REFERENCES: In the main text,  tables, graphs or figures references should follow scientific international  notation, e.g.: (FIGUEIREDO, 9999); or (FIGUEIREDO, 999:99). </p>
      <p>A reference list must be included at the end of the  manuscript, starting on a separate page, unnumbered, and in alphabetical order.  They must include all authors referred to in the text, tables, graphs or  figures, following the criteria:</p>
      <p>Books:&nbsp; FIGUEIREDO, Marcus. (9999), The life in  Saturn. Rio de Janeiro: Editora Saturno.<br>

      <p>TABLES: Each table must be on  a separate sheet(s) and should have a short descriptive heading; they must be  typed in Times New Roman, 12 point size, 1.5 spaces, as in the article&rsquo;s main  body. Notes and sources must be placed bellow the tables, using Times New  Roman, 10 point size. We recommend the use of Microsoft Word&rsquo; Table Function or  Excel. <br>
GRAPHS: Each graph must be on  separate sheet(s) and should have a short descriptive heading. We recommend the  use of Excel or similar and suggest that the sheets with the figures used to  create the graphs be also submitted. Notes and sources must be placed bellow  the graphs, using Times New Roman 10 point size. </p>
      <p>FIGURES AND ILLUSTRATIONS: Each Figure must be on  separate sheet(s). Originals should be submitted in photo-like format. Legends,  titles, notes and sources must be part of the figure sheet(s).</p>
      <p>PROOFS: The corresponding  author will receive proofs by email and, at this state, will be able to check  the manuscript and make corrections when appropriate.&nbsp; <br>
COPYRIGHT ASSIGNMENT FORM:  Authors are required to assign copyright of their articles to the Brazilian  Political Science Association. Copyright assignment is a condition of  publication.</p>
