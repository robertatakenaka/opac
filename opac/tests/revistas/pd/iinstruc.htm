    <TD width="70%"><P>Authors  should type in the &quot;Comments to the Editor&quot; a cover letter presenting  the work and explaining the main contribution to the Weed Science. The letter  should indicate that the work was not submitted for publication elsewhere.</P>
      <P> Articles  and reviews should not exceed 25 pages (A4 paper with margins of 3 cm, font  Times New Roman size 12, pages and lines numbered sequentially), including  tables and figures. The Research Notes should not exceed 12 pages, including  tables and figures.</P>
      <P> The text  should be typed into the Word (Microsoft) program and 1.5 spacing. The main  divisions of the text (Introduction, Methods, and Results and Discussion)  should be in uppercase and bold, and centered on the page. Scientific notes do  not have divisions.</P>
      <P> The title  of the manuscript must reflect the content of the work and should not have  subtitles, abbreviations, formulas and symbols. The scientific name must be  indicated in the title only if the species is unknown.</P>
      <P> The names of the author and co-authors should be included in the Submission  System in the same order they appear in the final work. Please, do not indicate  the authorship of the work in the text of the manuscript.</P>
      <P> The abstract must have the goal of the research clearly and concisely, the  methods briefly and the most relevant results and conclusions and not should contain  references. The text should not exceed 250 words with short sentences with  complete connection with each other. The title and abstract in Portuguese  should be faithful versions of the text in English.</P>
      <P> The key  words in English and Portuguese should not repeat title words and should  include the scientific name of species. Words must be separated by a comma and  begin with small letters, including the first term. The authors should present  from 3 to 6 terms, considering that a term may be composed of two or more  words.</P>
      <P> The Introduction should have one to two pages, include the rationale for  conducting the work, placing the importance of the scientific problem. The  information contained in the Introduction should be sufficient to establish the  hypothesis of the research. The scientific hypothesis must be written. The authors should cite recent studies published in  scientific journals, but the citation of classical works is accepted. It is prohibited to quote bulletins or technical  circulars. In the last  paragraph of the Introduction, the authors must submit a scientific hypothesis  and the objective of the study, the same as the summary.</P>
      <P> Material and Methods should present a description of the experimental  conditions and methods used so that there is enough information to repeat the  work. Formulas, expressions, or mathematical equations should be initiated to  the left of the page. Include references to statistical analysis and report  about the transformation of the data. Indication of statistical significance  should be as follows: p &lt;0.01 or p&gt; 0.05 (&quot;p&quot; in lower case).</P>
      <P> In Results and Discussion, the authors should present the research results and  discuss them in order to relate the variables examined to the objectives of the  study. The mere  comparison of results with the data presented by other authors did not  characterize the discussion of them. The authors should avoid excessive  speculation and the data should not be presented both in tables and figures.</P>
      <P> There  will be no extra chapter for Conclusions, but the authors may finish the  chapter &quot;Results and Discussion&quot; with a summarized conclusion.</P>
      <P> Only the  strictly necessary references for the understanding of the article should be  cited, we recommend around 25 references to articles and scientific notes. The  list of references should begin on a new page.</P>

      <P> The  author citations in the text should be in small caps, followed by year of  publication. For two authors, use &quot;and&quot;. Having more than two  authors, cite the last name first, followed by et al. More than one article of  the same authors, in the same year, must be indicated with small letters: Silva  et al. (2008a, b). Personal communications, or unpublished reports should be  cited in footnotes. They should not appear in References. The citation of  papers published in scientific events should be avoided.</P>
      <P> References  are normalized according to the models bellow and should be in alphabetical  order and chronological order of the year; having two or more authors, separate  them by semicolons; the titles of journals should be spelled out and include  only the works cited in the text, tables and / or figures, as follows:</P>

      <p>When absolutely necessary to the understanding of the work, tables and  figures should be shown in the text. The table or figure and its respective  caption should be self-explanatory. The titles of tables and figures should be  clear and complete and include the name (common or scientific) of the species  and the dependent variables. Figures should appear at the end of the text. We  considered figures: graphs, drawings, maps and photographs used to illustrate  the text. Authors should avoid colors in the figures, except for photographs.  For composite figures, each graph should be marked with the inscription  &quot;(a, b, c...)&quot; in  lowercase.<br>
      Tables and figures should be placed after the listing of references. The  numbers in the tables should be aligned with the comma in the column. Figures  and tables must be accompanied by its caption, with the units following the  International System of Units and positioned at the top of the columns in the  tables. The magnitudes, in case of compound units, should be separated by space  and an indication of the denominators must be rated in superscript. Examples: (µmol m-2 s-1),  [mg (g MS)-1].</p>
      <p>  <strong>IMPORTANT  RECOMMENDATIONS:</strong> <br>
        - Not to mention the lab, department, center or university where the  research was conducted.<br>
        - In the online submission of work, the names of the author and co-authors must  be entered into the System in the same order they appear in the final work. Do  not indicate the authorship of the work in the text of the manuscript. <strong>Manuscripts</strong><strong> with more than six (</strong><strong>6</strong><strong>) authors  will be rejected.</strong><strong><br>
              </strong>- Failure to standards will require the return of work.</p>
