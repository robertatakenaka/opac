 <td width="70%"><p>The Brazilian Journal of  Physical Therapy (BJPT) publishes original research articles, reviews, and  brief communications on topics related to the professional activity of physical  therapy and rehabilitation, including clinical, basic or applied studies on the  assessment, prevention, and treatment of movement disorders. Our Editorial  Board is committed to disseminating quality scientific investigations from many  areas of expertise.</p>
   <p> The BJPT follows the principles of publication ethics  included in the code of conduct of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE).</p>
   <p> All submissions will be screened for  plagiarism using IThenticate software. <br>
     Open Access Policy - The BJPT is  published under the Open Access model, therefore its articles are free to read,  download, copy, and disseminate, provided it is for educational purposes.</p>
   <p> Authors will not be charged any fees for the editorial processing and  publication of accepted articles.</p>
   <p> The BJPT accepts the following types of study, which must be directly  related to the journal's scope and expertise areas:</p>
   <p> a) Experimental studies:  studies that investigate the effect(s) of one or more interventions on outcomes  directly related to the BJPT's scope and expertise areas.</p>
   <p> The World Health Organization  defines a clinical trial as &ldquo;any research study that prospectively allocates  human participants or groups of humans to one or more health-related  interventions to evaluate the effect(s) on health outcome(s)&rdquo;. Clinical trials  include single-case experimental studies, case series, nonrandomized clinical  trials, and randomized clinical trials. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)  must follow the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials)  recommendations, which are available at: <a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/consort-statement/overview0/" target="_blank">http://www.consort-statement.org/consort-statement/overview0/</a>.</p>
   <p> The CONSORT checklist and  Statement Flow Diagram, available at <a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/consort-statement/flow-diagram">http://www.consort-statement.org/consort-statement/flow-diagram</a>, must be completed and submitted with the  manuscript.</p>
   <p> Clinical trials must  provide registration that satisfies the requirements of the International  Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), e.g. ttp://clinicaltrials.gov/  and/or http://www.anzctr.org.au. The complete list of all clinical trial  registries can be found at: <a href="http://www.who.int/ictrp/network/primary/en/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.who.int/ictrp/network/primary/en/index.html</a><u> </u><br>
       <u>We  suggest that all authors register clinical trials prospectively via the website  www.clinicaltrials.gov</u></p>
   <p>
     b) <strong>Observational  studies: </strong>studies that investigate the relationship(s) between variables of  interest related to the BJPT's scope and expertise areas without direct  manipulation (e.g. intervention). Observational studies include cross-sectional  studies, cohort studies, and case-control studies.</p>
   <p> c) <strong>Qualitative studies: </strong>studies  that focus on understanding needs, motivations, and human behavior. The object  of a qualitative study is guided by in-depth analysis of a topic, including  opinions, attitudes, motivations, and behavioral patterns without  quantification. Qualitative studies include documentary and ethnographic  analysis.</p>
   <p> d) <strong>Systematic reviews: </strong>studies  that analyze and/or synthesize the literature on a topic related to the scope  and expertise areas of the BJPT. Systematic reviews that include meta-analysis  will have priority over other systematic reviews. Those that have an  insufficient number of articles or articles with low quality in the Methods  section and do not include an assertive and valid conclusion about the topic  will not be considered for peer-review analysis. The authors must follow the  Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)  checklist to format their systematic reviews. The checklist is available at <a href="http://www.prisma-statement.org/PRISMAStatement/Default.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.prisma-statement.org/PRISMAStatement/Default.aspx</a> and must be filled in and submitted with the  manuscript. Potential authors are encouraged to read the paper Mancini MC,  Cardoso JR, Sampaio RF, Costa LCM, Cabral CMN, Costa LOP. Tutorial for writing  systematic reviews for the Brazilian Journal of Physical Therapy (BJPT). Braz J  Phys Ther. 2014 Nov-Dec; 18(6):471-480. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/bjpt-rbf.2014.0077" target="_blank">http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/bjpt-rbf.2014.0077</a>.</p>
   <p> e) <strong>Studies on the  translation and cross-cultural adaptation of questionnaires or assessment  tools:</strong> studies that aim to translate into and/or cross-culturally adapt  foreign questionnaires to a language other than that of the original version of  existing assessment instruments. The authors must use the checklist (<a href="/img/revistas/rbfis/checklistEN.pdf">Appendix</a>) to format this type of paper and adhere to  the other recommendations of the BJPT. The answers to the checklist must be  submitted with the manuscript. At the time of submission, the authors must also  include written permission from the authors of the original instrument that was  translated and/or cross-culturally adapted.</p>
   <p> f) <strong>Methodological studies</strong>: studies centered on the development and/or  evaluation of clinimetric properties and characteristics of assessment  instruments. The authors are encouraged to use the Guidelines for Reporting  Reliability and Agreement Studies (GRRAS) to format methodological papers, in  addition to following BJPT instructions. <br>
     Important: Studies that  report electromyographic results must follow the Standards for Reporting EMG  Data recommended by ISEK (International Society of Electrophysiology and  Kinesiology), available at <a href="http://www.isek-online.org/standards_emg.html" target="_blank">http://www.isek.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Standards-for-Reporting-EMG-Data.pdf</a>.</p>
   <p> g) <strong>Clinical trial protocols</strong>: The BJPT welcomes the publication of  clinical trial protocols. We only accept trial protocols that are substantially  funded, have ethics approval, and have been prospectively registered. Authors  should use the SPIRIT statement while formatting the manuscript (<a href="http://www.spirit-statement.org">http://www.spirit-statement.org</a>).</p>
   <p> h) <strong>Short communications: </strong>The BJPT will publish one short communication per issue (up to six a year)  in a format similar to that of the original articles, containing 1200 words and  up to two figures, one table, and ten references.<br>
     The following types of  study will be considered as low priority for publication:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>narrative  reviews;</li>
     <li>case studies.</li>
   </ul>
   <p><strong><u>Ethical  and legal aspects</u></strong> <br>
     Submitting a manuscript to  the BJPT implies that the paper has not been submitted simultaneously to  another journal. The papers published in the BJPT are free access and  distributed under the terms of Creative Commons Attribution, Non-Commercial  License (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.pt_BR" target="_blank">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed</a>), which allows free non-commercial use,  distribution, and reproduction into any means, as long as the original format  is maintained. The reproduction of part of a manuscript, even partially,  including translation to another language, requires prior authorization from the  editor.</p>
   <p> The authors must cite the  corresponding credits. Ideas, data or phrases from other authors without the  appropriate citations and with hints of plagiarism will be subject to penalties  according to the COPE code of conduct.</p>
   <p> If part of the material has  been presented in a preliminary format (at a symposium, conference, etc.), the  reference of the presentation must be cited as a footnote in the title page.</p>
   <p> The use of patient  initials, names or hospital registration numbers must be avoided. Patients must  not be identified in photographs, except with their express written consent  attached to the original article at the time of submission.</p>
   <p> Studies in humans must be  in agreement with COPE ethical standards and must be approved by the  institution&rsquo;s ethics committee.</p>
   <p> Animal experiments must  comply with international guidelines (such as those of the Committee for  Research and Ethical Issues of the International Association for the Study of  Pain, published in Pain, 16:109110, 1983).</p>
   <p> The BJPT reserves the right  not to publish manuscripts that do not adhere to the legal and ethical rules  for human and animal research.</p>
   <p>  <strong><u>Authorship  criteria</u></strong> <br>
     The BJPT accepts  submissions of manuscripts with up to six (6) authors. The BJPT&rsquo;s authorship  policy follows ICMJE requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical  Journals (<a href="http://www.icmje.org/" target="_blank">www.icmje.org</a>), which state that &ldquo;authorship credit should  be based on 1) substantial contributions to conception and design, acquisition  of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; 2) drafting the article or  revising it critically for important intellectual content; and 3) final  approval of the version to be published.&rdquo; Conditions 1, 2, and 3 should all be  met simultaneously. Grant acquisition, data collection, and/or general  supervision of a research group do not justify authorship and must be  recognized in the acknowledgements.</p>
   <p> In exceptional cases, the  editors may consider a request for submission of a manuscript with more than  six (6) authors. The criteria for analysis include the type of study, potential  for citation, quality, and methodological complexity, among other things. In  these exceptional cases, each author&rsquo;s contribution must be described at the  end of the text, after the Acknowledgements and right before the References as  recommended by the ICMJE and the Guidelines for Integrity of Scientific  Activity widely publicized by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&iacute;fico e  Tecnol&oacute;gico (CNPq) (<a href="http://www.cnpq.br/web/guest/diretrizes" target="_blank">http://www.cnpq.br/web/guest/diretrizes</a>).</p>

 <td width="70%"><p><strong>Original  manuscripts </strong> <br>
The official language of the  BJPT is English. The BJPT accepts the submission of manuscripts with up to  3,500 words (excluding title page, abstract, references, tables, figures, and  legends). The information contained in appendices will be included in the total  number of words allowed.
   <p> The manuscript must include  a title and identification page, abstract, and keywords before the body of the  manuscript. References, tables, figures, and appendices should be inserted at  the end of the manuscript.
   <p><strong>Title and  identification page</strong> <br>
     The title of the manuscript  must not exceed 25 words and must include as much information about the study  as possible. Ideally, the terms used in the title should not appear in the list  of keywords. The identification page must also contain the following details: 
   <p> Full title and short title  of up to 45 characters to be used as a legend on the printed pages; 
   <p> Authors: author&rsquo;s first and  last name in capital letters without title followed by a superscript number  (exponent) identifying the institutional affiliation (department, institution,  city, state, country). For more than one author, separate using commas; 
   
   <p> Corresponding author: name,  full address, email, and telephone number of the corresponding author who is  authorized to approve editorial revisions and provide additional information if  needed.   
   <p> Keywords: up to six  indexing terms or keywords in Portuguese and English.
   <p>  <strong>Abstract</strong> <br>
     The abstract must be  concise, not exceeding 250 words in a single paragraph in English, and must be  inserted immediately after the title page. Do not include references, footnotes  or undefined abbreviations in the abstract. It must be written in a structured  format.
   <p><strong>Bullet  points </strong> <br>
     On a separate page, the  manuscript must identify three to five phrases that capture the essence of the  topic under investigation and the main conclusions of the paper. Each bullet  point must be written in a summarized fashion and provide the main contributions  of the study to the current literature, as well as the clinical implications  (i.e., how the results can influence clinical practice or scientific research  in the area of physical therapy and rehabilitation). These points must be  presented in a text box in the beginning of the article, after the abstract.  Each bullet point must have no more than 80 characters (with spaces).
   <p><strong>Introduction</strong> <br>
     This part of the manuscript  should describe and define the topic under investigation, explain the  relationships with to other studies in the same field, justify the need for the  study, and specify the objective(s) of the study and hypotheses, if applicable.
   <p><strong>Methods</strong> <br>
     This section consists in  describing the methodological design of the study and presenting a clear and detailed  report of the study participants and data collection procedures,  transformation/reduction, and analysis in order to allow reproducibility of the  study. For clinical trials, the participant selection and allocation process  must be organized in a flowchart containing the number of participants in each  phase as well as their main characteristics (see model of CONSORT flow  diagram).
   <p> Whenever relevant to the  type of study, the author should include the calculation that adequately  justifies the sample size for investigation of the intervention effects. All of  the information needed to estimate and justify the sample size used in the  study must be clearly stated.
   <p> The authors must describe  the dependent and independent variables; whether the parametric assumptions  were met; specify the software used in the data analysis and the level of  significance; and specify the statistical tests and their purpose.
   <p><strong>Results</strong> <br>
     The results should be  presented briefly and concisely. Pertinent results must be reported with the  use of text and/or tables and/or figures. Data included in tables and figures  must not be duplicated in the text. <br>
     The results must be  summarized into self-explanatory graphs or tables using measures of central  tendency and variability (e.g. mean (SD) instead of mean&plusmn;SD); must include  measures of magnitude of effect (e.g. effect size) and/or indicators of the  precision of the estimates (e.g. confidence intervals); must report the power  of the non-significant statistical tests.
   
   <p><strong>Discussion</strong> <br>
     The purpose of the  discussion is to interpret the results and to relate them to existing and  available knowledge, especially the knowledge already presented in the  Introduction. Be cautious when emphasizing recent findings. The data presented  in the Methods and/or in the Results sections should not be repeated. Study  limitations, implications, and clinical application to the areas of physical  therapy and rehabilitation sciences must be described.
   <p><strong>References</strong> <br>
     The recommended number of  references is 30, except for systematic reviews of the literature. Avoid  references that are not available internationally, such as theses and  dissertations, unpublished results and articles, and personal communication.  References should be organized in numerical order of first appearance in the  text, following the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to  Biomedical Journals prepared by the ICMJE.
   <p> Journal titles should be  written in abbreviated form, according to the List of Journals of Index  Medicus. Citations should be included in the text as superscript (exponent)  numbers without dates. The accuracy of the references appearing in the  manuscript and their correct citation in the text are the responsibility of the  author(s).<br>
     Examples: <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html" target="_blank">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html</a>.
   <p>  <strong>Tables,  Figures, and Appendices</strong> <br>
     An overall total of five  (5) tables and figures is allowed. Appendices must be included in the number of  words allowed in the manuscript. In the case of previously published tables,  figures, and appendices, the authors must provide a signed permission from the  author or editor at the time of submission.
   <p> For articles submitted in  Portuguese, the English version of the tables, figures, and appendices and  their respective legends must be attached in the system as a supplementary  document.
   <p> -Tables: these must include  only indispensable data and must not be excessively long (maximum allowed: one  A4 page with double spacing). They should be numbered consecutively using  Arabic numerals and should be inserted at the end of the text. Small tables  that can be described in the text are not recommended. Simple results are best  presented in a phrase rather than a table.
   <p> - Figures: these must be  cited and numbered consecutively using Arabic numerals in the order in which  they appear in the text. The information in the figures must not repeat data  described in tables or in the text. The title and legend(s) should explain the  tables and figures without the need to refer to the text. All legends must be  double-spaced, and all symbols and abbreviations must be defined. Use uppercase  letters (A, B, C, etc.) to identify the individual parts of multiple figures.
   <p> Whenever possible, all  symbols should be placed in the legends. However, symbols identifying curves in  a graph can be included in the body of the figure, provided this does not  hinder the analysis of the data. Figures in color will only be published in the  online version. With regard to the final artwork, all figures must be in high  resolution or in its original version. Low-quality figures will not be accepted  and may result in delays in the process of review and publication.
   <p> - Acknowledgements: these  must include statements of important contributions specifying their nature. The  authors are responsible for  obtaining the authorization of individuals/institutions named in the  acknowledgements. 
   <p> Authors are strongly encouraged &nbsp;to use EQUATOR network checklists that are  specific for their research design (for example, CONSORT statement for clinical  trials, PRISMA statement for systematic reviews or STROBE statement for  observational studies).

The criteria used  for the initial analysis of the area editor include: originality, pertinence,  clinical relevance, and methodology. The manuscripts that do not have merit or  do not conform to the editorial policies will be rejected in the pre-analysis  phase, regardless of the adequacy of the text and methodological quality.  Therefore, the manuscript may be rejected based solely on the recommendation of  the area editor without the need for further review, in which case, the  decision is not subject to appeal. The manuscripts selected for pre-analysis  will be submitted to review by specialists, who will work independently. The  reviewers will remain anonymous to the authors, and the authors will not be  identified to the reviewers. The editors will coordinate the exchange between  authors and reviewers and will make the final decision on which articles will  be published based on the recommendations of the reviewers and area editors. If  accepted for publication, the articles may be subject to minor changes that  will not affect the author's style. If an article is rejected, the authors will  receive a justification letter from the editor. After publication or at the end  of the review process, all documentation regarding the review process will be  destroyed.</p></td>
