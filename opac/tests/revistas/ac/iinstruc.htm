    <td width="70%"><p>Original and unpublished scientific articles  are accepted for publication.  Articles  must be based on research, related to the area of knowledge called Technology  for the Built Environment, which covers conceptual design, design, production,  operation, maintenance, demolition and recycling or reuse of buildings and  their immediate surroundings.</p>
      <p>We do not accept texts that contain a simple bibliographic review,  without the research method or approach being original. If part of the results  presented have already been disclosed, the design of the text and its main  conclusions must be original and unpublished.</p>
<p><strong>Ethics and Plagiarism  Policy</strong></p>
      <p>Only original and unpublished articles, which must be based on research,  are accepted for publication. Your article is first evaluated by the  editor-in-chief to analyse the relevance of the subject and if it follows  the editorial guidelines of the journal. If  accepted in this step, your article will be checked concerning information  about the authorship of the article in the text and file, so as to ensure  double blind evaluation regarding the originality of the text to avoid  publishing articles that harm the ethics of academic production.<br>
        Still  concerning ethics, it is essential that the authors observe the following  requirements:</p>
      <p>- only authors  who contributed significantly to the content and production of the article should  be listed as authors. Recognition of advisory contributions can be made in the  acknowledgments section at the end of the article;<br>
        - authors  should make sure that all the sources used to write the article are duly cited,  ensuring the originality of the text not practising plagiarism and  self-plagiarism. The journal uses specific software to check the submitted  papers for plagiarised content (Plagiarisma.net and Plagium).</p>
      <p><strong>Article  Processing Charges and submission fees</strong><br>
        No fees are charged to submit and evaluate articles.<br>
        <br>
However, upon completion of the peer review process, accepted articles  will be proofread, carried out by professionals accredited by the journal.  Proofreading services will be charged directly to the authors by the accredited  professionals. </p>
<p><strong>Peer  review</strong>&nbsp;<strong> </strong><br>
Articles submitted to the Ambiente Construído journal are evaluated  using a double blind peer review system. It is the editor´s responsibility to  check the relevance of the subject and if the author has followed the editorial  guidelines of the journal. If your article   is accepted at this stage, your article is sent to at least three  reviewers bearing no indication of the authorship. In order to ensure a  standard in this evaluation process, the editorial staff has prepared a form  including recommendations that guide the reviewers to prepare their report on  your article. After the reviewers have done this, the editor sends you your  article, according to the recommendations given by the peers without  identifying them. </p>      The editorial board  of the journal Ambiente Constru&iacute;do recommends that the peer reviewers&rsquo;  assessments take the following items into consideration: organization and structure  of the paper, text quality, technical and scientific quality of the study,  relevance of the theme and originality of the subject and consistency of the  results presented.&nbsp; With regards to the  structure, reviewers are asked to consider the logical structure of the paper,  which must include a theoretical background, a description of the research methods  and presentation and discussion of the results. As to the text, reviewers will  check for clarity and also spelling and grammatical quality. Assessment of the  technical and scientific quality involves an analysis of the correct employment  of concepts, depth of the content, scientific rigour of the investigation and citations  of fundamental, internationally acknowledged references as well as clear  contributions to scientific knowledge. As to the relevance, the work must be  connected with significant issues related to the built environment technology.  With respect to originality, reviewers must evaluate the uniqueness of the  contribution, in addition to the innovation potential of the work. The journal  also allows reviewers to add criteria that may contribute to improve the  quality of the publication.</td>

      <p>Articles submitted to Ambiente Constru&iacute;do cannot have been previously 

        published, must be original, and be the result of research work. The maximum 

        size is 7000 words. Articles that contain only literature review should 

        not be accepted, unless they an original research method or approach. 

        In case parts of the results have been published somewhere else, the conception 

        of the article and its main conclusions should be necessarily original.</p>

      <p>The structure of the article should have:</p>

      <p><b>Title</b>: the title of the article should be brief and sufficiently 

        specific and descriptive, and should include some key-words that are representative 

        of the content of the text. (maximum 15 words)</p>

      <p><b>Indication of authorship</b>: no information identifying the authors 

        should be included in the paper. The identification of the authors should 

        be made in the appropriate fields available at SEER (<a

  href="http://www.seer.ufrgs.br/ambienteconstruido" target="_blank">www.seer.ufrgs.br/ambienteconstruido</a>). 

        The name of each author should be included in full in that system, without 

        abbreviation. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b>: an abstract of between 100 and 200 words should be included 

        at the beginning, in the language used for writing the article. A translation 

        of the abstract into English should be made, if the article is not written 

        in that language, or into Portuguese, if the article is written in English. 

        The abstract should present clearly the aim of the paper, a short description 

        of the research work, and the main results achieved. </p>

      <p><b>Keywords</b>: after the abstract, between three and six keywords, 

        which help in the identification of the main topics discussed in the article, 

        must be included.</p>

      <p><b>Article</b>: the text should have an introduction section, with the 

        aim of informing the reader about the theme to be discussed, including 

        the results of relevant previous research. A brief literature review 

        must be presented, including key references on which the research work 

        was found. A substantial part of the article should be for describing the  development of the research and discussing the results obtained. The  description, although brief, should be clear, enabling the reader to fully  understand the procedure adopted, or to have access to it by references cited.  The research method should be presented in detail, including the outline or  strategies used, as well as clearly specified data collection and analysis  tools.<br>
An item containing conclusive comments is considered essential, highlighting  the main aspects of the research and their contributions to the existing  knowledge. </p>
<p><b>References</b>: all references of publications directly or indirectly 

        cited in the text should be included. Those references must be formatted 

        according to the NBR 6023:2002 standard, and listed in alphabetic order. 

      </p>

      <p><b><i>Apud</i></b>: articles that are cited as <i>apud</i> must have 

        a complete reference as a footnote in the same page that it is cited. 

      </p>

      <p>After the assessment of the referees, if the paper is accepted, the following 

        steps are carried out:</p>

      <p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Language revision (carried out by a 

        specialist);</p>

      <p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Format and standardization (carried 

        out by a librarian);</p>

      <p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall revision by one of the editors-in-chief;</p>

      <p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Final revision by authors.</p>

      <p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inclusion of the final version of the 

        paper in SEER, in <i>pdf</i>.</p>
      <p><strong>Check list</strong></p>
      <p>        As part of the submission process, authors are required to verify the  compliance of the submission with respect to all of the items listed below.  Submissions that do not comply with the standards will be returned to the  authors:</p>
