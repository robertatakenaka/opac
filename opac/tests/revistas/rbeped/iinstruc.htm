  &ndash; empirical researches must present the  research procedures, criteria for constituting the sample or for selecting the  subject population, data collection methods, construction and data analysis.<br>
  &ndash; theoretical researches must show  original elaboration about a relevant topic or issue to the educational field.</p>
   <p>&bull; <em>Experience  Reports</em> &ndash; articles theoretically grounded, based on pedagogical  intervention projects in the educational context or continuing education of  teaching professionals.</p>
   <p>&bull; <em>Reviews </em>&ndash; critical analysis of books or films released in the last three years  related to education. The reviews must present a title, the book reference or  technical details, information about the authors of the reviewed work, the  abstract or summary, as well as an analytical position of the reviewer on how  the work contributes to the educational area.</p>

   <p>Articles and  reviews must be submitted exclusively through the Electronic Editorial System  of Journals (Sistema Eletr&ocirc;nico de Editora&ccedil;&atilde;o de Revistas &ndash; Seer). Instructions  are available at: <a href="http://www.rbep.inep.gov.br" target="_blank">http://www.rbep.inep.gov.br</a></p>
   <p>Articles must contain  between 28.000 and 42.000 characters (with spaces) and can be submitted at all  times of the year. The journal accepts the submission of articles in English,  Portuguese or Spanish.</p>
   <p>Articles are previously evaluated by the Executive Editorial  Board to verify the compliance with the conditions specified in the &ldquo;General  Guidelines for the Presentation of Articles&rdquo;. Fulfilled these conditions, articles are then assessed by <em>ad hoc</em> consultants of recognized  competence in specific areas, from different regions and institutions. After,  at least, two <em>ad hoc</em> consultants&rsquo;  analyses, the recommendations of the consultants are sent to the Scientific  Editorial Board, which is responsible for the final assessment. Articles are  submitted to the Scientific Editorial Board without the authors&rsquo; identification,  to ensure impartiality in the evaluation.</p>
   <p>The recommendations involve three types of  judgment:</p>
   <p> &bull; Accepted &ndash; the article is scheduled for  publication.<br>
  &bull; Accepted with modifications &ndash; the author  is required to make adjustments or revisions in the article, by sending a new  version for final evaluation.<br>
  &bull; Rejected &ndash; the article is not accepted.</p>
   <p>The Scientific  Editorial Board of RBEP is responsible for the final opinion in relation to the  approval of articles.</p>
   <p>The acceptance of the  article automatically implies the transference of copyright to Inep, in  relation to the work.</p></td>
