      <p>The Revista Brasileira de Educação Física e Esporte is a publication 
        of the School of Physical Education and Sport of the Universidade de Sao 
        Paulo, and aims to publish research which contributes to the advancement 
        of knowledge about human movement related to physical education, sports 
        and related areas. </p>
      
      <p>This standardization is intended to give researchers and reviewers greater 
        flexibility in the submission process, review and publication of scientific 
        articles. Please, notice that: </p>
      
      <p>1. Will consider for publication original research under the condition 
        that unique contributions to this journal, ie, that have not been, and 
        will not be published elsewhere. </p>
      <p>2. The submission of papers will be made only by means of uploading the 
        web site. However, prior to submission, authors should go through a checklist 
        verifying that all listed procedures were performed before the final submission. 
      </p>
      <p>3. Articles will be evaluated in two instances. In the first instance 
        the director of RBEFE check the format, general aspects of writing and 
        consistency of work. The board may either refuse the article in the first 
        instance, if the work does not meet the quality standards of RBEFE, or 
        request changes before accepting the submission. After submission, the 
        article will be sent to two experts in the process of double blind. If 
        there are conflicting opinions director RBEFE reserves the right to choose 
        a tie for third reviewer or to decide on the acceptance or denial of the 
        article. </p>
      <p>4. At the time of submission the authors may request both two preferred 
        reviewers and two non-preferred possible reviewers. However, the final 
        decision on the choice of reviewers will be up to the editor of the Journal.</p>
      <p>5. The submission of articles to the reviewers should also be done electronically. 
        However, the reviewer should always acknowledge receipt of files in electronic 
        format. </p>
      <p>6. The reviewers should receive a form containing the main points that 
        should be evaluated in the review process. </p>
      <p>7. Reviewers will receive e-mails a week before the deadline for the 
        submission of the review. </p>
      <p>8. An archive of End Note is available online for the formatting of references. 
      </p>
      <p>9. The following types of articles may be submitted to RBEFE: </p>
      
      <p>- Original articles in the areas: </p>
      <p>1) Biomechanics of human movement</p>
      <p>2) Pedagogy of human movement</p>
      <p>3) Studies in Sport</p>
      <p>4) Sociology of Physical Education and Sport</p>
      
      <p>- Short reviews in areas 1, 2 and 3. However, Short Reviews are written 
        by guest authors, or experts of renowned academic ability. </p>
      <p>Each volume of RBEF will have only two (2) short reviews. The publication 
        of these will be in accordance with the date of submission. The standards 
        for review will be equal to the original articles, but the sections of 
        materials and methods, results and discussion should be exchanged by the 
        literature review. </p>
      
      <p>10. From the time of receipt of suggestions from our reviewers, the authors 
        will have a maximum of 60 days to make the suggested changes. If the return 
        of the article happens after that period, the article will be considered 
        as a new submission, and not as an article in the review process. </p>
      <p>11. Articles may be sent in three languages: Portuguese, English and 
        Spanish. </p>
      <p>12. The authors are responsible for the content and writing of articles. 
        Any errors are the sole responsibility of the same. </p>
      <ol start=1 type=1>
        <li>13. During the review process authors should include in the header 
          item code and revision number (e.g.  05_ago-57 Revision 1).</li>

      <p>
        <b>Instructions for writing the sections of the work</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>Abstract:</b> It should contain no more than three hundred words, and 
        should not be structured (separating and highlighting, purposes, methods, 
        results and conclusion). The keywords should not be contained in the title 
        and should be at most 5. </p>
      <p><b>Introduction</b>: This section should develop the research hypothesis 
        both accurately and carefully, leading to the purpose of the work. Clearly 
        state the research hypothesis and purpose of the work at the end of the 
        introduction. Its feature should not be a chapter, so the literature review 
        must be made in the discussion at the time of the explanations and comparisons 
        of the findings. The introduction must have no more than 7 concise paragraphs 
        and not have sub-titles.</p>
      <p><b>Methods</b>: It is desirable that the authors begin this section with 
        a generic explanation of the research design and, if possible, include 
        a figure describing the design. The authors are encouraged to follow a 
        structure of sub-topics presented below. </p>
      <p>1. Participants: The sample characteristics should be defined and the 
        conditions for controlling the main intervening variables described. Moreover, 
        if the study involves humans, descriptive characteristics of the participants, 
        which are not dependent variables, must be presented in the text (not 
        include these data in tables). It is mandatory to explicit approval of 
        the research protocol by the local ethics committee and that participants 
        signed an informed consent before participation. </p>
      <p>2. Procedures: All instruments and procedures used to collect data should 
        be described in sufficient detail for reproduction purposes. If the study 
        contains training protocols, or stimulation, a clear distinction must 
        be made between the procedures for testing and training.</p>
      <p>3. Statistical analysis: The authors should clearly describe the dependent 
        variables and statistical tests. Factors and levels should also be described 
        when appropriate. It is important to include the level of significance 
        and measures of reproducibility of the tests. </p>
      <p><b>Results</b>: The authors should only describe the results that meet 
        the purposes of the work. Additional data that are not related to the 
        research problem should be disregarded. Make sure that figures and / or 
        tables are cited in the text and that there is no duplication of information 
        between tables and figures. It is advisable that the authors also show 
        effect sizes to assist in the discussion of the results. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Discussion</b>: This section should begin with a paragraph repeating 
        the purposes of the study and reporting the main findings. Then, the results 
        should be discussed in light of existing literature in an attempt to explain 
        their research hypotheses and compare the findings with those of other 
        studies. Do not include obvious statements like &quot;more research is 
        needed ...&quot;. </p>

        The socio-cultural area also has the possibility to develop articles that 
        aim to answer a specific question, but without the collection of empirical 
        data. These works are referred to as essays and may be published in RBEF. 
        The format of these items is different from that presented for original 
        articles, but it should be able to demonstrate clearly the main aspects 
        of work. First, the authors should clearly state the essay thesis. Second, 
        authors must develop content relevant to support their thesis. Finally, 
        expose the closing remarks. </p>
