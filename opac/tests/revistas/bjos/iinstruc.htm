        involving human beings, in the event of publication in this journal, be
        conducted in conformity with such principles and others specified in the
        respective ethics committees of authors' institution. In the case of
        experiments with animals, such ethical principles must also be followed. When
        surgical procedures in animals were used, the authors should present, in the
        Material and methods section, evidence that the dose of a proper substance
        was adequate to produce anesthesia during the entire surgical procedure. All
        experiments conducted in human or animals must accompany a description, in
        the Material and methods section, that the study was approved by the
        respective Ethics Committee of authors' affiliation and provide the number of
        the protocol approval. The Editor-in-Chief and the Editorial Board reserve
        the right to refuse manuscripts that show no clear evidence that the methods
        used were not appropriate for experiments in humans or animals.</p>
      <p>Clinical Trial Registration - International Standard Randomized
        Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN)</p>
      <p>The Brazilian Journal of Oral Sciences supports the policies of
        the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Committee of
        Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) for the registration of clinical trials. The
        journal recognizes the importance of such initiatives for the registration
        and international publication of clinical studies with an open access.
        Therefore, the Brazilian Journal of Oral Sciences will publish only those
        clinical trials that have previously received an identification number, the
        ISRCTN, validated by the criteria established by the WHO and ICMJE. The WHO
        defines clinical trials as &quot;any research study that prospectively
        assigns human participants or groups of humans to one or more health-related
        interventions to evaluate the effects on health outcomes. Interventions
        include but are not restricted to drugs, cells and other biological products,
        surgical procedures, radiologic procedures, devices, behavioral treatments,
        process-of-care changes, preventive care, etc&quot;.</p>
