      <p>The Brazilian Journal of Veterinary Parasitology  accepts articles that focus primarily on animal parasites. Authors are  required to send a signed cover letter in which they declare that they were  responsible for the whole process of producing the manuscript and that it is  entirely an unpublished original article. If the abstract of the manuscript has  been presented in scientific meetings, this should be stated in the signed  cover letter as well.</p>
      <p>Author consent forms  for manuscripts that have more than one author are required, to ensure that all  authors agree with the publication. All  authors need to have made substantial contributions to the study design, data acquisition,  data analysis and interpretation, and drafting of the article, and need to have  given final approval of the version to be submitted. Collaborators who did not actively participate in  the process described above may be listed in the Acknowledgements section.  Researchers who provided technical support or suggestions or a department head  who made the research work possible should be acknowledged. Manuscripts with a  number of authors that does not seem justifiable will be assessed by our  assistant scientific editors in relation to the experimental research protocol.</p>
      <p>The manuscript review process will follow the journal’s Editorial  Guidelines and consider the editors’ and/or ad hocreviewer’sopinions. The Editor-in-chief and  assistant scientific editors may make suggestions or request changes to the  manuscript but the authors are ultimately responsible for the entire text  content. Articles that are submitted for publication will be reviewed by at  least two anonymous reviewers, of whom one will be a foreigner. The reviewers  will be selected by the editor-in-chief and assistant scientific editors. If  the reviewers’ opinions are discordant with each other, the article will be sent  to a third reviewer.</p>
    <p>The Brazilian Journal of Veterinary Parasitology accepts manuscripts as Full Articles, Short  Communications and Review Articles. Review Articles are submitted by experts on  request from the editors. Unsolicited review articles will not be accepted but  the editors or assistant scientific editors may accept suggestions for a review  topic.</p>
    <p><strong>Paper submission:</strong>
    <br>
      The articles submitted must undergo  English-language revision, done by reviewers accredited by the RBPV (<u><a href="http://cbpv.org.br/rbpv/revisoes_traducoes.php">http://cbpv.org.br/rbpv/revisoes_traducoes.php</a></u>).  A certificate of English-language  revision should be sent together with the submitted article. The authors  will be expected to bear the costs of the revision. If one of the coauthors is  a foreigner who is a native English speaker, this author should review the  English-language content of the study and send a formal certifying letter to  the RBPV.</p>
    <p><strong>Publication fee:</strong><br>
After the article has been accepted, the  following publication fees will be charged:<br>
R$ 250,00  (associados do CBPV em dia com as anuidades);<br>
    R$ 500,00 (não-associados do CBPV).</p>
    <p><strong>For foreign authors:</strong><br>
    
    US$ 92.00 (for associates of CBPV who are  up-to-date with their membership dues);<br>
    US$ 184.00 (for non-associates of CBPV).</p>

    <p><strong>Peer review process</strong><br>
    
    The manuscript review process will follow the  journal’s Editorial Guidelines and consider the editors’ and/or the ad hoc  reviewer’s opinions. Articles that are submitted for publication will be  reviewed by at least two anonymous reviewers, of whom one will be a foreigner.  The reviewers will be selected by the editor-in-chief and assistant scientific  editors. If the reviewers’ opinions are discordant with each other, the article  will be sent to a third reviewer.</p>
    <p>The reviewer should fill out the  RBPV’s evaluation form, which is available in the online submission system (<a href="http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/rbpv-scielo" target="_blank">http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/rbpv-scielo</a>).  The author will receive evaluations from at least two reviewers, as statements  on evaluation forms and possibly as corrections made directly in the text. The  reviewer may then correct the article, if necessary. After the manuscript has  been accepted by the ad hoc reviewers, but before it is sent for the authors’  responses, it will undergo a final analysis by one of the assistant scientific  editors. It should be noted that the assistant scientific editors have  autonomous authority to suggest corrections and/or reject publication of an  article, even if the reviewers have already approved it.</p>
    <p>After the layout and  editing processes, the assistant scientific editors and editor-in-chief of the  journal will make any final corrections.</p>
    <p><strong>Transfer of author’s rights:</strong><br>
    
    At the time of submission, the article must be  accompanied by a formal letter signed by all the authors, in which they declare  that they were responsible for the whole process of producing the manuscript  and that it is entirely an unpublished original article; and that they all  agree with the submission and, if approved, publication of the article only in  the RBPV.</p></td>

    <p><strong>The following guidelines should be followed during manuscript  preparation:</strong><br>
    
    All articles should be submitted in United  States English. Always use concise and impersonal language. Footnotes should be placed at the bottom of the  corresponding page and numbered with Arabic numerals in an ascending order. All  manuscripts should be typed in Times New Roman font, size 12, page setup with  2.5-cm top and bottom margins, 3-cm left and right margins, and 1.5-cm line  spacing. All pages should be numbered. Full Articles must not exceed 17 pages  in the final layout. Short Communications must not exceed 6 pages in the final  layout. All tables and illustrations should be presented separately from the  main text body and attached to the final manuscript without captions. The  related captions should be included in the text after the References. It is the  authors’ responsibility to make sure that submitted papers are reviewed by one  of the English language reviewers certified by RBPV. Full Articles should be  structured as follows: <strong>Original Title</strong>,<strong> Translated Title</strong>,<strong> Author(s)</strong>,<strong> Affiliations</strong>,<strong> Abstract</strong> <strong>(Keywords)</strong>,<strong> Introduction</strong>, <strong>Materials and Methods</strong>,<strong> Results</strong>,<strong> Discussion</strong>,<strong> Conclusions </strong>(or a combination of  the last three), <strong>Acknowledgements</strong> (optional), and <strong>References</strong>. Short  Communications should follow the same structure as described above, but they  can be presented as a continuous stream of text without the need to include  headings. For this category, manuscripts that are submitted will only be  accepted if they have a high degree of novelty and originality that brings to  light new findings of evident importance. The Editor-in-chief will determine  whether these submissions may proceed.</p>
    <p><strong>Description of each item of the manuscript</strong><br>
      <strong>Original title</strong><br>
    
    The full title and subtitle, if any, should not  exceed 18 words. The title should not include any abbreviations, and species  names and Latin words should be italicized. Titles that start with &ldquo;Preliminary  studies,&rdquo; &ldquo;Notes about,&rdquo; and the like should be avoided. Do not use the  author&rsquo;s name and date of citation in scientific names.</p>
    <p><strong>Author(s)/Affiliations</strong><br>
    
    List all authors’ full name (with no abbreviations).  Affiliations should include the original institution names, not their English  translations, in the following order: laboratory, department, college or  school, institute, university, city, state and country. Include at the bottom  of the page the corresponding author information: full address, telephone  number, and current e-mail.</p>
    <p><strong>References</strong><br>
    
    References will only be accepted if they are  reader-friendly. References of papers published in conference proceedings will  not be accepted and theses only if they are available for consultation at  official websites such as the CAPES thesis bank: <a href="http://www.capes.gov.br/servicos/banco-de-teses" target="_blank">http://www.capes.gov.br/servicos/banco-de-teses</a>.  All cited references in the text should be carefully checked for the authors’  names and dates exactly as they appear in the reference section.</p>
    <p><strong>Abstract</strong> <br>
Abstracts are limited to 200 words  and should be structured in a single paragraph with no indentation. The  abstract should not include references. A<em>cronyms</em><strong> </strong>or<strong> </strong><em>abbreviations should be written</em> out in full and the <em>abbreviation</em> given in <em>brackets the first time  they</em> are used in <em>abstract, f</em>or  example, indirect fluorescence assay (IFA). The abstract should be informative  and present the objectives, a brief description of methods, the main results,  and a conclusion. All manuscripts written in English should also have the  abstract and keywords written in Portuguese.</p>
    <p><strong>Keywords</strong><br>
Keywords should accurately reflect  the text content. Limited to a maximum of 6 (six).</p>
    <p><strong>Introduction</strong> <br>
Should have a clear and concise  justification of the study including its relevance and objectives and should  keep the number of citations to a minimum.</p>
    <p><strong>Materials and Methods</strong><br>
    
    A concise description including core information  for the understanding and reproduction of the study. Well-established methods  and techniques should be cited and referenced but not described. Statistical  analyses should be described at the end of the section.</p>
    <p><strong>Results</strong><br>
    
    The content of this section should be  informative rather than interpretative. The results should be accompanied by  self-explanatory tables, figures, or other illustrations if necessary.</p>
    <p><strong>Discussion</strong> <br>
Its content should be interpretative  and based on the study results only. The discussion can be a single section or  it can be presented together with the results and conclusions. It should  emphasize the relevance of new findings and new hypotheses clearly supported by  the results.</p>
    <p><strong>Tables</strong><br>
    
    Tables must be in editable format (e.g., Excel  list format) and supplied in separate files. The word &ldquo;Table&rdquo; should precede  the table title. Tables should be numbered consecutively with Arabic numerals  and have a concise and descriptive title placed above them. They should be  typed using double spacing and should  have horizontal rules separating the header and the last row. The number of  tables in the manuscript should be limited to a minimum.</p>
    <p><strong>Figures</strong> <br>
Figures consist of drawings,  photographs, boards, charts, flow charts, and diagrams and should be supplied  in TIF, GIF, or JPG format with a minimum resolution of 300 dpi. They should be  numbered consecutively with Arabic numerals and the word &ldquo;Figure&rdquo; should  precede the legend placed below them. List all numbered legends with their  symbols and standard icons in a separate file with double spacing. Figures  should be limited to a minimum. Digital pictures should be supplied in separate  files. A graphic bar scale instead of a numerical one should be used in all  illustrations, as it can be adjusted with size reduction. </p>
    <p><strong>Conclusions</strong> <br>
All conclusions may be presented in  the Discussion section or in the Results and the Discussion sections when  presented together, at the authors’ choice. If this is the case, there is no  need for a separate Conclusions section. </p>
    <p><strong>Acknowledgments</strong> <br>
Should be limited to a minimum.</p>
    <p><strong>References</strong> <br>
References should be listed  alphabetically and then sorted chronologically, if necessary. More than one  reference by the same author(s) in the same year must be identified by the  letters &ldquo;a,&rdquo; &ldquo;b,&rdquo; &ldquo;c,&rdquo; etc., placed after the year of publication. Titles of  journals should be abbreviated according to Index Medicus, <a href="http://www2.bg.am.poznan.pl/czasopisma/medicus.php?lang=eng" target="_blank">http://www2.bg.am.poznan.pl/czasopisma/medicus.php?lang=eng</a>.</p>
