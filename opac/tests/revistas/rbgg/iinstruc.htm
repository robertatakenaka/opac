  <td width="70%"><p>All articles, irrespective of their category, should be written in accordance with RBGG guidelines, observing the study design of the article (described in the Checklist on the journal site – <a href="http://www.rbgg.com.br">www.rbgg.com.br</a>).</p>
  <p><strong>Original articles</strong>: these must be original research papers that aim to publish new research findings concerning subject areas that are relevant to the study area. Although other structures may be accepted, in general, papers must adhere to the following structure: Introduction, Methodology, Results, Discussion and Conclusions.</p>
   <p>Papers may contain a maximum of 4,000 words, excluding the abstract, bibliographic references, tables and figures. Maximum 35 number of references and 5 tables and figures.</p>
   <p>The trial registration identification number will be requested for the acceptance of original studies that contain randomized controlled trial and clinical trial data.</p>
   <p><strong>Revisions</strong>: <br>
    a) <strong>Systematic review - </strong>a type of review that aims to resolve a specific issue that is the focus of the review. It is conducted through a synthesis of the results of quantitative or qualitative original studies and describes the methodology adopted in researching the studies, the criteria that were used to select the studies that were included in the review and the procedures that were implemented in summarizing the results obtained.</p>
   <p>  <br>
    b) <strong>Integrative revision </strong>- a broad method of review that allows for the inclusion of theoretical and empirical literature, in addition to studies that adopt alternative methodological approaches (quantitative and qualitative). The studies that are included in the review must be analyzed systematically with respect to their objectives, methodologies and the materials used.</p>
   <p>Maximum of 4,000 words, excluding the abstract and bibliographic references. Maximum 50 number of references and 5 tables and figures. <br>
    <strong>Case studies</strong>: Unpublished reports, with a well-documented description, related to the thematic area of the journal. The purpose of this category is to announce new variations in disease processes, treatments or unusual results, etc., for which there has not yet been time for an analysis with a greater number of cases to be prepared and submitted as an "original article". The authors should describe, in the argument of the text, its relevant features and relationship with cases previously published in literature in this area. The text should include an Introduction, Method, Results (describing the unpublished experiment), Discussion and Conclusion.</p>
   <p>Maximum of 3,000 words, excluding the abstract and bibliographic references. Maximum 25 number of references and 3 tables and figures.</p>
   <p><strong>Updates</strong>: descriptive and interpretative papers that are based on the overall current status of the subject that is being studied or that may undergo research.</p>
   <p>Maximum of 3,000 words, excluding the abstract and bibliographic references. Maximum 25 number of references and 3 tables and figures.</p>
   <p><strong>Research briefs</strong>: Brief reports of the preliminary research results of studies in progress or which have been recently completed, anticipating innovative results. These need to be published as a matter of urgency as they demonstrate strong evidence of relationships between variables that may lead to public health risks, even though not all alternative hypotheses or effects have been fully understood.</p>
   <p>Maximum of 1,500 words, excluding the abstract and bibliographic references. Maximum number of references: 10 and a table/figure.</p>
   <p><strong>Letter to the editor: </strong>An individual opinion about a determined article.</p>
   <p>Maximum of 600 words, excluding the abstract and bibliographic references. Maximum number of references: 08.</p>
