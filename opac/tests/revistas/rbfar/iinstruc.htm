    <td width="70%"><p>The Revista Brasileira de Farmacognosia (Brazilian Journal of  Pharmacognosy) is a periodical dedicated to the publication of original  scientific work, reviews and communications in the field of Pharmacognosy (the study  of crude drugs and  substances derived from natural sources used as medicines).</p><br>
      <p><strong>Types of articles</strong></p>
      <p>
        The Brazilian  Journal of Pharmacognosy accepts for publication original scientific work,  reviews and communication articles written <strong>only</strong> in English.</p>
      <p>
        <em>&bull;  Original papers: </em>Original papers are research articles  describing original experimental results. The manuscript should be arranged in  the following order:<strong> Graphical  abstract</strong>, Title,  Abstract, Keywords, Introduction, Material and Methods, Results, Discussion, Acknowledgements,  Authorship, References, Figures with Legends, Tables, Structural Formulae and Supplemental  files (if applicable). Results and Discussion sections may appear as a combined  &lsquo;Results and Discussion&rsquo; section. The normal length of the main text of an  Original Paper (excluding references, tables, figures and figure legends) is  approximately 3,000 words. Longer manuscripts may be accepted only in  exceptional and well justified cases. <br>
        &bull; <em>Short communications:</em> This section will  cover mainly the isolation of known compounds from new neotropical sources, or  complementary results of on-going work. The text should be arranged as follows: <strong>Graphical abstract</strong>, Title, Abstract of 200 words, Keywords,  Introductory Remarks, Material and Methods with brief experimental details  without subheadings, Results and Discussion as one body of text without  headlines, Acknowledgements, Authorship, References (up to 20 citations) and  Figures and/or Tables (up to 3). The text should not exceed 2,000 words.<br>
        &bull; <em>Reviews</em>: Authors are invited to submit a review article that  provides concise and critical updates on a subject, and with around 100  references. The main purpose of reviews is to provide a concise, accurate  introduction to the subject matter and inform the reader critically of the  latest developments in the field. They should be concise and include details of  the search strategy used, such as time frame, search terms, used databases. A  review should be an article that produces knowledge and not just a kind of  survey of the existing literature. The review must be a response to an initial question.  Reviews of a particular herbal drug will be considered if they contain the  newest issue and a perspective on future directions.      </p>
<p>Authors are strongly recommended to prepare a  manuscript using a A4-sized paper, double-spaced, with Times New Roman size-12  font, fully justified, with margins of 2 cm. </p><br>

      <p><strong>Peer review</strong> <br>
        This journal operates a single blind review process. All contributions will be initially assessed by the editor for suitability for the journal. Papers deemed suitable are then typically sent to a minimum of two independent expert reviewers to assess the scientific quality of the paper. The Editor is responsible for the final decision regarding acceptance or rejection of articles. The Editor's decision is final. 
      <p><strong>Use of word processing software</strong><br>
        Regardless of the file format of the original submission, at revision you must provide us with an editable file of the entire article. Keep the layout of the text as simple as possible. Most formatting codes will be removed and replaced on processing the article. The electronic text should be prepared in a way very similar to that of conventional manuscripts. <br>
      To avoid unnecessary errors you are strongly advised to use the 'spell-check' and 'grammar-check' functions of your word processor.</p>
      <p><strong>Article structure</strong><br>
      The manuscript should be arranged in the following order: Graphical abstract, Title, Abstract, Keywords, Introduction, Material and Methods, Results, Discussion, Acknowledgements, Authorship, References, Figures with Legends, Tables, Structural Formulae and Supplemental files (if applicable).</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Subdivision - unnumbered sections</strong><br>
        Divide your article into clearly defined sections. Each subsection is given a brief heading. Each heading should appear on its own separate line. Subsections should be used as much as possible when cross-referencing text: refer to the subsection by heading as opposed to simply 'the text'.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Essential title page information</strong></p>
     Title: Concise and informative. Titles are often used in information-retrieval systems. Avoid abbreviations and formulae where possible.<br>
        Author names and affiliations: Please clearly indicate the given name(s) and family name(s) of each author and check that all names are accurately spelled. Present the authors' affiliation addresses (where the actual work was done) below the names. Indicate all affiliations with a lower-case superscript letter immediately after the author's name and in front of the appropriate address. Provide the full postal address of each affiliation, including the country name and, if available, the e-mail address of each author. Author affiliations should be presented in decreasing hierarchical order (e.g. Harvard University, Harvard Business School, Boston, USA) and should be written as established in its own language (e.g. Universit&eacute; Paris-Sorbonne; Harvard University, Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo). <br>
        Corresponding author: Clearly indicate who will handle correspondence at all stages of refereeing and publication, also post-publication. Ensure that the institutional e-mail address is given and that contact details are kept up to date by the corresponding author.<br>
        Present/permanent address: If an author has moved since the work described in the article was done, or was visiting at the time, a 'Present address' (or 'Permanent address') may be indicated as a footnote to that author's name. The address at which the author actually did the work must be retained as the main, affiliation address. Superscript Arabic numerals are used for such footnotes.</p>
      <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
        A structured abstract of &le; 300 words, by means of appropriate headings, should provide the context or background for the research and should state its purpose, basic procedures (selection of study subjects or laboratory animals, observational and analytical methods), main findings (giving specific effect sizes and their statistical significance, if possible), and principal conclusions. It should emphasize new and important aspects of the study or observations. The journal does not accept abbreviations in the abstract.<br>
        Immediately after the abstract, provide a maximum of six keywords in alphabetical order and separated by commas, to represent the content of the article.<br>
        Please avoid using the plant name species in the keywords as it should be already in the title and/or in the abstract. Choose representative words to help indexation and readers to reach your article.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Graphical abstract</strong><br>
        A Graphical abstract is mandatory for this journal. It should summarize the contents of the article in a concise, pictorial form designed to capture the attention of a wide readership online. Authors must provide images that clearly represent the work described in the article. Graphical abstracts should be submitted as a separate file in the online submission system. Image size: please provide an image with a minimum of 531 x times; 1328 pixels (h &amp;times; w) or proportionally more. The image should be readable at a size of 5 &amp;times; 13 cm using a regular screen resolution of 96 dpi. Preferred file types: TIFF, EPS, PDF or MS Office files.
      <br> <br>
        BJP does not accept Graphical abstract using images of animals.
      <p>
        <strong>Introduction</strong><br>
      State the objectives of the work and provide an adequate background, avoiding a detailed literature survey or a summary of the results.</p>
      <p>
       <strong> Material and methods</strong><br>
        Provide sufficient detail to allow the work to be reproduced. Methods already published should be indicated by a reference: only relevant modifications should be described.<br><br>
        <em>Plant name species</em><br>
        Plant names should be complete, including author name and family, according  to <a href="http://www.theplantlist.org/">http://www.theplantlist.org/</a>  or <a href="http://www.tropicos.org">http://www.tropicos.org</a>, and <a href="http://floradobrasil.jbrj.gov.br/reflora">http://floradobrasil.jbrj.gov.br/reflora</a></p>
      <p>
        <em>Structural Formulae</em><br>
        Chemical structures are not considered as figures, should be numbered sequentially in bold letters according to their citations in the manuscript, and placed closed to the desired point in the manuscript body. Structures should be drawn according to the style set by the American Chemical Society. Chemical structures of well known compounds will not be published. </p>
      <p><em>Abbreviations</em><br>
        Define abbreviations that are not standard in this field in a footnote to be placed on the first page of the article. Such abbreviations that are unavoidable in the abstract must be defined at their first mention there, as well as in the footnote. Ensure consistency of abbreviations throughout the article.
        <br> <br>
        <em>Units</em><br>
      Follow internationally accepted rules and conventions: use the International System of Units (SI). If other units are mentioned, please give their equivalent in SI.</p>
      <p>
        <em>Math formulae</em><br>
        Please submit math equations as editable text and not as images. Present simple formulae in line with normal text where possible and use the solidus (/) instead of a horizontal line for small fractional terms, e.g., X/Y. In principle, variables are to be presented in italics. Powers of e are often more conveniently denoted by exp. Number consecutively any equations that have to be displayed separately from the text (if referred to explicitly in the text).      </p>
      <p><strong>Results</strong><br>
        Results should be clear and concise. </p>
      <p>
       <strong> Discussion</strong><br>
        This should explore the significance of the results of the work, not repeat them. A combined Results and Discussion section is often appropriate. Avoid extensive citations and discussion of published literature.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Acknowledgements</strong><br>
        Collate acknowledgements in a separate section at the end of the article before the references and do not, therefore, include them on the title page, as a footnote to the title or otherwise. List here those individuals who provided help during the research (e.g., providing language help, writing assistance or proof reading the article, etc.).</p>
      <p>
       <strong> Authors contributions</strong><br>
        The role of each author involved in the development of the study and/or the elaboration of the manuscript must be clearly described, and he/she should be referred to by his/her initials.</p>

        <strong>Artwork</strong><br>
        The journal uses recycled paper, so colour figures are accepted and will abe available only on the online version. </p>
      <p><strong>Image manipulation</strong><br>
        Whilst it is accepted that authors sometimes need to manipulate images for clarity, manipulation for purposes of deception or fraud will be seen as scientific ethical abuse and will be dealt with accordingly. For graphical images, this journal is applying the following policy: no specific feature within an image may be enhanced, obscured, moved, removed, or introduced. Adjustments of brightness, contrast, or color balance are acceptable if and as long as they do not obscure or eliminate any information present in the original. Nonlinear adjustments (e.g. changes to gamma settings) must be disclosed in the figure legend.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Electronic artwork</strong><br>
        General points<br>
        &bull; Make sure you use uniform lettering and sizing of your original artwork. <br>
        &bull; Preferred fonts: Arial (or Helvetica), Times New Roman (or Times), Symbol, Courier. <br>
        &bull; Number the illustrations according to their sequence in the text. <br>
        &bull; Use a logical naming convention for your artwork files. <br>
        &bull; Indicate per figure if it is a single, 1.5 or 2-column fitting image. <br>
        &bull; For Word submissions only, you may still provide figures and their captions, and tables within a single file at the revision stage. <br>
        &bull; Please note that individual figure files larger than 10 MB must be provided in separate source files.</p>
      <p><em>Formats</em><br>
        Regardless of the application used, when your electronic artwork is finalized, please 'save as' or convert the images to one of the following formats (note the resolution requirements for line drawings, halftones, and line/halftone combinations given below): <br>
        EPS (or PDF): Vector drawings. Embed the font or save the text as 'graphics'. <br>
        TIFF (or JPG): Color or grayscale photographs (halftones): always use a minimum of 300 dpi. <br>
        TIFF (or JPG): Bitmapped line drawings: use a minimum of 1000 dpi. <br>
        TIFF (or JPG): Combinations bitmapped line/half-tone (color or grayscale): a minimum of 500 dpi is required. </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Please do not:</strong><br>
        &bull; Supply files that are optimized for screen use (e.g., GIF, BMP, PICT, WPG); the resolution is too low. <br>
        &bull; Supply files that are too low in resolution. <br>
        &bull; Submit graphics that are disproportionately large for the content.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Color artwork</strong><br>
        Please make sure that artwork files are in an acceptable format (TIFF (or JPEG), EPS (or PDF), or MS Office files) and with the correct resolution. If, together with your accepted article, you submit usable color figures then the journal will ensure, at no additional charge, that these figures will appear in color online (e.g., ScienceDirect and other sites) regardless of whether or not these illustrations are reproduced in color in the printed version. </p>
      <p>
       <strong> Figure captions</strong> <br>
        Ensure that each illustration has a caption. A caption should comprise a brief title (not on the figure itself) and a description of the illustration. Keep text in the illustrations themselves to a minimum but explain all symbols and abbreviations used.</p>
      <p>
       <strong> Tables</strong><br>
      Please submit tables as editable text and not as images. Tables can be placed either next to the relevant text in the article, or on separate page(s) at the end. Number tables consecutively in accordance with their appearance in the text and place any table notes below the table body. Be sparing in the use of tables and ensure that the data presented in them do not duplicate results described elsewhere in the article. Please avoid using vertical rules.</p>
      <p>
      <strong> References</strong><br>
        <em>Citation in text </em><br>
      Please ensure that every reference cited in the text is also present in the reference list (and vice versa). Any references cited in the abstract must be given in full. Unpublished results and personal communications are not recommended in the reference list, but may be mentioned in the text. If these references are included in the reference list they should follow the standard reference style of the journal and should include a substitution of the publication date with either 'Unpublished results' or 'Personal communication'. Citation of a reference as 'in press' implies that the item has been accepted for publication.<br><br>
        <em>Reference links</em><br>
        Increased discoverability of research and high quality peer review are ensured by online links to the sources cited. In order to allow us to create links to abstracting and indexing services, such as Scopus, CrossRef and PubMed, please ensure that data provided in the references are correct. Please note that incorrect surnames, journal/book titles, publication year and pagination may prevent link creation. When copying references, please be careful as they may already contain errors. Use of the DOI is encouraged. A DOI can be used to cite and link to electronic articles where an article is in-press and full citation details are not yet known, but the article is available online. A DOI is guaranteed never to change, so you can use it as a permanent link to any electronic article. An example of a citation using DOI for an article not yet in an issue is: VanDecar J.C., Russo R.M., James  D.E., Ambeh W.B., Franke  M., 2003. Aseismic continuation of the Lesser Antilles slab beneath northeastern Venezuela. J. Geophys, Res. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2001JB000884i">http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2001JB000884i</a>. Please note the format of such citations should be in the same style as all other references in the paper.<br><br>
        <em>Web references </em><br>
        As a minimum, the full URL should be given and the date when the reference was last accessed. Any further information, if known (DOI, author names, dates, reference to a source publication, etc.), should also be given. <br><br>
        <em>Data references</em><br>
        This journal encourages you to cite underlying or relevant datasets in your manuscript by citing them in your text and including a data reference in your Reference List. Data references should include the following elements: author name(s), dataset title, data repository, version (where available), year, and global persistent identifier. Add [dataset] immediately before the reference so we can properly identify it as a data reference. This identifier will not appear in your published article.<br><br>
        <em>References in a special issue </em><br>
        Please ensure that the words 'this issue' are added to any references in the list (and any citations in the text) to other articles in the same Special Issue.<br><br>
        <em>Reference style </em><br>
        Text: All citations in the text should be chronologically and refer to: <br>
        Author in lower case, followed by the publication year between parenthesis, e.g.  Pereira (1999); at the end of the citation: Author in lower case and year, both between parenthesis. e.g. (Silva, 1999) or (Silva and Souza, 1998) or (Silva et al., 1999) or (Silva et al., 1995a,b); textual citation: the page must be provided, e.g. (Silva, 1999, p. 24).      </p>
      <p><em>List</em>: References should be arranged first alphabetically and then further sorted chronologically if necessary. More than one reference from the same author(s) in the same year must be identified by the letters 'a', 'b', 'c' etc., placed after the year of publication. <br>

    <td width="70%"><p><strong>Availability of accepted article</strong><br>
This journal makes  articles available online as soon as possible after acceptance. This concerns  the accepted article (both in HTML and PDF format), which has not yet been  copyedited, typeset or proofread. A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is  allocated, thereby making it fully citable and searchable by title, author  name(s) and the full text. The article's PDF also carries a disclaimer stating  that it is an unedited article. Subsequent production stages will simply  replace this version.    
      <p><strong>Proofs</strong><br>
      One set of page proofs (as PDF files) will  be sent by e-mail to the corresponding author or, a link will be provided in  the e-mail so that authors can download the files themselves. The journal  provides authors with PDF proofs which can be annotated; for this you will need  to <a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader">download the free  Adobe Reader</a>. Instructions on how to annotate PDF  files will accompany the proofs (also given online). The exact system  requirements are given at the <a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/reader/system-requirements.html">Adobe site</a>. If you do not wish to use the PDF annotations function, you may list  the corrections (including replies to the Query Form) and return them in an  e-mail. Please list your corrections quoting line number. If, for any reason,  this is not possible, then mark the corrections and any other comments  (including replies to the Query Form) on a printout of your proof and scan the  pages and return via e-mail. Please use this proof only for checking the  typesetting, editing, completeness and correctness of the text, tables and  figures. Significant changes to the article as accepted for publication will  only be considered at this stage with permission from the Editor. We will do  everything possible to get your article published quickly and accurately. It is  important to ensure that all corrections are sent back to us in one  communication: please check carefully before replying, as inclusion of any subsequent  corrections cannot be guaranteed. Proofreading is solely your responsibility.</p>      <p></p></td>
