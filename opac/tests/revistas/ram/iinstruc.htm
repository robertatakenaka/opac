      <p>The <em>Revista de  Administração Mackenzie</em> (RAM – Mackenzie Management Review)  is a scientific journal whose <strong>mission</strong> is to contribute to the excellence of academic activities  in the field of of business management, and to the development of  administrative action in organizations through the disclosure of scientific  research works in the form of unpublished high-quality theoretical and  empirical articles that generate new knowledge in the field. Articles can be  empirical, theoretical or measurement oriented. Conceptual articles should  provide new theoretical insights capable of advancing our understanding of  management and organizations. Empirical articles should have well-articulated  and strong theoretical foundations. All kinds of empirical methods  -quantitative, qualitative or combinations - are acceptable.</p>
      <p> RAM is structured into&nbsp;three sections. The first  section, <strong>Human and  Social Management</strong>&nbsp;<strong>in  Organizations,</strong>&nbsp;publishes papers on organizational  development focused on social and human issues, thus contributing to the  creation of innovative management processes in organizations, based on  relations of respect and reliance with&nbsp;stakeholders, values,  organizational culture, diversity and organizational learning.<br>
        The second section,  <strong>Strategic Finance,&nbsp;</strong>includes  works covering the issue of how companies and individuals make decisions on  funding and allocating resources (whether or not financial), based on  parameters of the notion of creating shareholder/owner value.</p>
      <p> The third section and  last, <strong>Resources and Corporate Development,&nbsp;</strong>publishes  works that discuss internal and external resources of organizations as factors  that govern competitive dynamics, corporate development and strategy,  organizational expertise, competitive intelligence, innovation, competitive  environment, business models, discussing aspects of organizational management.</p>
      <p> There are <strong>five acceptance requirements for submissions:</strong></p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>The first is that each author may submit not over two articles       annually to RAM, regardless of their condition (as author or co-author).       In other words, should an author submit an article as first author and       another as third author, he/she may not submit other articles during that       year.</li>
        <li>The second requisite is that articles must be unprecedented in the       country and overseas, and are not being considered for publication in any       other disclosure vehicles. Works published in the minutes of congresses       are considered, provided that in their definite publication format.</li>
        <li>The third requisite is that such works must be written in the       Portuguese, English or Spanish languages.</li>
        <li>The fourth requisite is that they should be associated with topics       for the section to which they were submitted and must be in accordance       with the section&rsquo;s policy.</li>
        <li>The fifth requisite is that articles must meet criteria and       technical features as required by RAM, its quoting and referencing style       must comply with APA standards.&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This Journal&rsquo;s <strong>target public</strong> consists of  professionals and students in the academic universe specialized in  administration, as well as managers of public, private and third sector  organizations interested in the development of administration. </p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><u>Peer Review Process </u></b></font></p>
      <p>This Journal&rsquo;s <strong>Editorial Process</strong> involves  three eliminatory stages as described below:</p>
      <p> 1.  During the first stage an article is received and examined by the  Editor-in-Chief and subsequently by the Editor of the Section to which it was  submitted for an admission review (<em>desk review</em>).  Editors may occasionally request a double-blind opinion by a Scientific  Editorial Body member (specialized in the article&rsquo;s area) in order to support  their decision. During this process the editors will ensure that the article  complies with the basic requisites for approval by the editorial process:&nbsp;</p>
      <ul type="disc">
          <li>Scientific relevance;&nbsp;</li>
		  <li>A significant theoretical and/or methodological contribution in the       field of knowledge in Administration; &nbsp;</li>
		  <li>unprecedented; correct       language;&nbsp;</li>
		  <li>good overall       presentation;&nbsp;</li>
		  <li>List of bibliographical references representing the topic in       question&rsquo;s state of the art, necessarily covering articles published in       the last five years in Brazilian and international scholarly circles;</li>
		  <li>Adequacy with editorial policy and the section to which it was       submitted.</li>
	  </ul>
		Articles not in  accordance with these basic requisites or with the criteria and technical  features required by RAM (see <a href="http://editorarevistas.mackenzie.br/index.php/RAM/about/editorialPolicies#focusAndScope">&nbsp;editorial policy</a>, <a href="http://editorarevistas.mackenzie.br/index.php/RAM/about/editorialPolicies#sectionPolicies">policies  by subject area sections</a> e <a href="http://editorarevistas.mackenzie.br/index.php/RAM/about/submissions#onlineSubmissions">guidance  to authors</a>) will be rejected by the Editor-in-Chief or by  the Section Editor<font size="2" face="Verdana">.</font>
		<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">	    2-&nbsp; The second stage consists of  an anonymous review of papers submitted for publication and the double blind  review system.&nbsp; These papers will be forwarded by the Section Editors to  the <em>ad hoc </em>reviewers, selected on the basis of their fields of  specialization and availability, whose affiliations are in States other than  those of the States of the authors.&nbsp; The Section Editors coordinate this  phase of the editorial process.&nbsp; Papers approved&nbsp; will be forwarded  to the Editor-in-Chief with a suggestion for publication.&nbsp; The Section  Editors may request a double blind expert opinion from a member of the  Scientific Editorial Body (specializing in the field of the paper) in order to  support their decisions.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">	    3-&nbsp; During the third stage of the  review process, the Editor-in-Chief takes the final decision on  publication.&nbsp; The Editor-in-Chief may also request a member of the  Scientific Editorial Committee to validate the previous stages, through a  double blind review process.&nbsp; In this case, the paper approved during the  previous phase and the respective expert opinions of the <em>ad hoc </em>reviewers  (not identified) are forwarded to a member of the Scientific Editorial  Committee (specializing in the field of the paper) for analysis and  validation.&nbsp; Approved papers are presented and recommended for publication  to the Editor-in-Chief by the Scientific Editorial Committee member.</font></p>
		<p>Approved  articles are published with the name of the Editor in charge. Following  approval for publication, the authors should sign the &ldquo;Free Copyright  Assignment&rdquo; document, a draft of which will be remitted by email to the  authors, with the reservation of rights, including for translation, to RAM. The  authors should sign the letter <u>singly or jointly</u> and forward it by conventional  mail to RAM within two weeks from receiving by email.&nbsp;<br>

		<p>The <strong>opinions, ideas and concepts contained in the  papers </strong>are the sole <strong>responsibility</strong> of their author(s).&nbsp; The Institution or any editorial entities related to  this Journal accept no liability for them. </p>
		<p>		  The papers submitted must be unpublished in Brazil and elsewhere in the  world.&nbsp; This Journal does not publish papers from guest authors or papers  translated from foreign scientific periodicals.&nbsp; However, papers that have  already been disclosed at congresses, seminars and similar events may be  submitted, provided that there are no constraints imposed by the organizers of  these events.&nbsp; All papers submitted, including those that have already  been disclosed at congresses, seminars and similar events will undergo the  review process described above.</p>
		<p>This Journal believes that the  quality of the expert opinions underpinning publication decisions for each  issue of this periodical must reflect a solid, transparent and meticulous  review process whose purpose must be to further knowledge in the field while  also fostering researchers&rsquo; development. </p>
		<p>Activities by reviewers are seen  as part of an ongoing collective process for constructing knowledge that must  underpin content enhancement and the manner in which research projects are  conducted.&nbsp; In order for this intention to materialize in the publication  of papers whose excellence is acknowledged at domestic and international  levels, reviewers engaged by this Journal must follow the guidelines listed  below, grounded on the document entitled <a href="http://www.mackenzie.br/fileadmin/Editora/Revista_Administracao/Boas_Praticas.pdf">Good Scientific Publication Practices</a> issued by the National Association for Graduate  Studies and Research in Administration (ANPAD):</p>
		<ul type="disc">
          <li>Reviewers should not agree to examine a manuscript if they feel       they are not professionally qualified in the respective topic.</li>
          <li>Reviewers must advise the Editor if an author&rsquo;s identity is known       to them.</li>
          <li>Reviewers must specifically agree to comply with timeframes or       discuss any alterations thereto for the review process of a paper proposed       by the editor, returning it by the agreed on date.</li>
          <li>Reviewers must study the editorial policy and reviewer instructions       carefully, following them.</li>
          <li>Reviewers must initially complete an in-depth reading at a single       session and may also mark or note down important points during this initial       reading.&nbsp; However, they must be attentive to the paper as a       whole.&nbsp; Subsequently, they must return to the review process, conduct       a detailed analysis and draw up an expert opinion.</li>
          <li>Reviewers must consider the existence of several paradigms,       striving to ensure that their reviews are neutral.&nbsp; Papers must be       analyzed in terms of their relevance and internal and external       consistency, rather than on the basis of theoretical or methodological       preferences.</li>
          <li>Reviewers must list any problems that can be corrected, stating       what should be done to rectify them while also assessing the cost-benefit       of the requested alterations in terms of enhancing the quality of the       paper.</li>
          <li>Reviewers must consider the references used, ensuring that they       cover related international and domestic literature on the topic addressed       by the paper, whether through the inclusion of classics or literature       updated during the past five years.&nbsp; When timely, they must suggest       relevant references to the authors for rewriting the paper.</li>
          <li>Whenever possible, reviewers must indicate all alterations required       and avoid further requests being issued for each re-submission, when this       could have been mentioned earlier.</li>
          <li>When receiving a new version of a paper, reviewers must ensure that       requests for alterations issued previously have been complied with or were       otherwise justified.</li>
          <li>Reviewer opinions must present well-grounded and objective       arguments that clearly justify the favorable or unfavorable stance adopted       for the paper under analysis.&nbsp; Extremely concise opinions should not       be used, providing only brief explanations of how a final decision was       reached on a paper&rsquo;s acceptance or rejection.</li>
          <li>The fields on the review sheet requesting analysis of positive and       negative aspects related to the theoretical grounds, methodology and       structure of the paper are mandatory and must be completed carefully.</li>
          <li>A constructive approached focused on enhancement must permeate the       review process.&nbsp; This means that a paper may be resubmitted for       successive reviews as required, until reaching the necessary level of       maturity.</li>
          <li>Compliance by the paper with the editorial line adopted by this       Journal, the <a href="http://editorarevistas.mackenzie.br/editora/index.php/RAM/about/submissions#authorGuidelines">Guidelines for Authors</a>, and a smooth flow and       internal coherence of the body text must be ascertained, as well as the       use of appropriate language.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Prospective candidates wishing  to apply for positions as <em>ad hoc </em>reviewers  must forward an email to this Journal necessarily stating: the section of this  Journal for which they would like to work; five key-words outlining their field  of specialization, certified by registration in the Lattes r&eacute;sum&eacute; of their  degrees and scientific bibliographic output in Qualis periodicals and at events  acknowledged as high quality in the field of Management knowledge; the number  of papers they are capable of reviewing each year; the State and country in  which they live; and the internet address (URL) of their r&eacute;sum&eacute; (for Brazilian  candidates the Lattes r&eacute;sum&eacute; URL on the website of the National Council for  Scientific and Technological Development - CNPq).&nbsp;These applications from  candidates will be assessed by the Editor-in-Chief and Section Editors. </p>
        <p> The members of the <strong>Scientific Editorial Committee</strong> are recruited  through invitations issued by the Journal Editor. The activities of the members  of this Committee are voluntary and not remunerated. The pre-requisites for  participation are the same as those established for the <em>ad hoc </em>reviewers.  Additionally, the members of this Committee must have held PhD degrees for at  least five years, with significant scientific and technical biographical  output, acknowledged as high quality by the editorial staff in their specialty  fields.</p>
        <p>  <strong><u>Conflicting Interests Policy </u></strong> </p>
        <p>        For the Mackenzie Administration Journal, a conflict of interest is any  interest of a financial, professional or personal type that actually or  potentially interferes in the preparation, review or publication of a paper and  the work giving rise to it. Authors and their employers (academic institutions  or not), sponsors, reviewers and editors may have conflicting interests.  Conflicting interests may be rated as hidden or explicit, real or perceived. <br>
      In order to pursue its mission, this Journal feels that it is important  to ensure that the research project presented in the papers are bias-free, the  greatest possible extent. Thus, the Journal Editor may decide not to accept  papers that he believes may be adversely affected in some way through a  conflicting interest declared by their authors. </p>
        <p> Any conflicting interest by the author or co-authors related to the  paper and the work giving rise to it and that are relevant and arise within  five years as from the start of the work must be disclosed.&nbsp; During the  submission process, the first author must state on his / her behalf and on  behalf of other co-authors the existence of any financial, personal and  professional interest that might actually or potentially influence the paper&rsquo;s  work and preparation.&nbsp; Examples of conflicting interests include but are  not limited to: research grants received from any sources, travel grants or  attendance at meetings, providing paid services, relations with this Journal&rsquo;s  editorial staff, relations with the organizations involved and participation in  Government agencies.&nbsp; All sources of financing for the work must be  described, including their role and involvement in the decision to submit the  paper for publication.&nbsp; Grants received by institutions or organizations  financing the paper from other institutions or organizations that are known to  the authors must also be declared.</p>
        <p> The Editor will take the final decision on the relevance of any  conflicts of interest declared by the authors and their possible influence on  the work or paper. If necessary, this matter will be discussed with the <em>ad  hoc reviewers and the </em>editorial staff. The decision will be based on the  conflicting interests declared by the authors. <br>
          The <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers of this Journal must also declare conflicts  of interest before starting to review any paper. Should any reviewer feel  unable to review a paper due to conflicting interests, the Editor must be  advised.</p>
        <p>  <strong><u>Copyright Declaration </u></strong> </p>
        <p>        Once the papers have been approved, the authors assign their copyrights  to this Journal. The Copyright Assignment Conditions include: </p>
        <p> 1. The Mackenzie Administration Journal holds the rights to all the  papers published thereby through assignment of copyright. </p>
        <p> 2. The author retains moral rights to the paper, including the right to  identify the author whenever the article is published. </p>
        <p> 3. As of July 1, 2015 RAM adopted the CC-BY license  standard (Creative Commons&ndash; BY). Authors are allowed to copy, distribute,  display, transmit and adapt articles. Authors must attribute to RAM explicitly  and clearly an article&rsquo;s original publication (with reference to the journal&rsquo;s  name, edition, year and pages in which the article was originally published),  yet without suggesting that RAM endorses the author or its use of the article.  Contents are released by means of the CC-BY license to fully inter-operate with  a variety of different systems and services, including for commercial purposes.  In case of an article&rsquo;s reuse or distribution, authors must make the article&rsquo;s  licensing terms clear to third parties. CC-BY criteria follow open access  policies by major OA (Open Access) publishers and journals, such as PLoS,  eLife, Biomed Central and Hindawi, among others.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>4.  Authors may take photocopies of the paper or distribute it through electronic  media, provided that this is intended for their own classes and research  activities, under the condition that: (a) such copies are not resold and (b)  reference to prior publication in this Journal (Journal name, issue, year and  pages) are shown clearly and explicitly on the coversheets of all the copies  taken of the paper. </p>

              <li><strong>2.&nbsp;Originality/Gap/Relevance/Implications</strong>: -         Explain why the article should be considered original. Which knowledge         gap does it complete? Are there issues with no replies on the subject         investigated?&nbsp; Does it propose a new approach, concept, theory,         paradigm? Does it encourage changes or advances in knowledge, in terms         of concepts, relationships, models or theories?&nbsp; What is its         practical usefulness (and interest)? Reflects trends likely to         contribute to present and future organizational changes?</li>
              <li><strong>3.&nbsp;Key         methodological aspects</strong>: - Briefly describe         the methodological approach and survey techniques; - qualitative,         quantitative, mixed. Survey strategy. Data gathering and analysis         technique.

              <li><strong>5. Key         considerations/conclusions</strong>: -         What do the results mean (interpreted in the light of relevant         theories), in particular in view of what was known on the subject under         investigation? Conclusions should not advance and be extended beyond         what is supported by their results. What would be the practical         applications of the outcome and which would be the next survey steps?</li>
