      <p><strong>Instructions  to Authors</strong><br>
      The Brazilian Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics  publishes the following categories of manuscripts:<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Original Articles</strong>, complete  prospective, experimental or retrospective studies. Manuscripts containing  original clinical or experimental research results have priority for  publication.</p>
      <p>  <strong>Case Reports</strong>, of great  interest and well documented from the clinical and laboratorial point of view. In  the letter of referral, authors should indicate new or unexpected aspects in  relation to already published cases. The text of Introduction and Discussion  sections should be based on an updated bibliographic review.</p>
      <p>  <strong>Review Articles</strong>, including  comprehensive reviews, meta-analysis or systematic reviews. Spontaneous contributions  are accepted. The methods and procedures adopted for obtaining the text should  be described, and based on recent references, including the current year. As  this subject is still subject to controversy, the review should discuss the  trends and lines of research under way. In addition to the text of the review,  there should be an abstract and conclusions. See the &lsquo;Instructions to Authors&rsquo;  section for information on the text body and title page;</p>
      <p>        <strong>Letters to the Editor</strong>, dealing with  editorial matters or not, but presenting relevant information to readers.  Letters can be summarized by the editor, but maintaining the main points. In  case of criticism to published works, the letter is sent to the authors so  their reply can be published simultaneously;</p>
      <p>        <strong>Editorial,</strong> only at the  publisher&rsquo;s invitation.</p>
      <p><strong>Title</strong><br>
        When writing a scientific article, the researcher  should focus on the manuscript title, which is the business card of any  publication. It should be elaborated very carefully, and preferably written  only after the article finalization. A good title adequately describes the  manuscript content. Generally it is not a phrase, because it does not contain  the subject, only verbs and arranged objects. Titles rarely contain  abbreviations, chemical formulas, adjectives, names of cities, among others. The  title of manuscripts submitted to RBGO must contain a maximum of 18 words.</p>
      <p><strong>Abstract</strong><br>
        The abstract should provide the context or basis for  the study, establish the objectives, basic procedures, main outcomes and key  findings. It should emphasize new and important aspects of the study or  observations. Since the abstract is the only substantive part of the article  indexed in many electronic databases, authors should ensure it reflects the  article content in an accurate and highlighted manner. Do not use  abbreviations, symbols and references in the abstract. In case of original  articles from clinical trials, authors must inform the registration number at  the end of the text.</p>
      <p><strong>Informational  abstract of structured type of original articles</strong><br>
      Abstracts of original articles submitted to RBGO must  be structured in four sections and contain a maximum of 250 words:</p>
      <p>  <strong>Objective:</strong> What was done; the question posed by the investigator.</p>
      <p>        <strong>Methods:</strong> How it was done; the method, including the material  used to achieve the objective.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Results:</strong> What was found, the main findings and, if necessary,  the secondary findings.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The conclusions; the answer to the question asked.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Informational  abstract of structured type of systematic review articles</strong><br>
      Among the included items are the review objective to  the question asked, data source, procedures for selecting the studies and data  collection, the results and conclusions. The abstracts of systematic review  articles submitted to RBGO must be structured in six sections and contain a  maximum of 250 words:</p>
      <p>  <strong>Objective:</strong> Declare the main purpose of the article.</p>
      <p>        <strong>Data  sources:</strong> Describe the data  sources examined, including the date, indexing terms, and limitations.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Selection  of studies:</strong> Specify the  number of studies reviewed and the criteria used in their selection.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Data  collection:</strong> Summarize the  conduct used for data extraction and how it was used.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Data  synthesis:</strong> State the main results  of the review and the methods used to obtain them.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> Indicate the main conclusions and their clinical  usefulness.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Informational  abstract of unstructured type of review articles, except systematic reviews and  case studies</strong><br>
        It shall contain the substance of the article,  covering the purpose, method, results and conclusions or recommendations. It  exposes enough details so readers can decide on the convenience of reading the  full text (Limit of words: 150).</p>
      <p><strong>Keywords</strong><br>
        The keywords of a scientific paper indicate the  thematic content of the text they represent. The main objectives of the  aforementioned terms are the thematic content identification, indexing of the  work in databases, and rapid location and retrieval of contents. The keyword  systems used by RBGO are DeCS (Health Sciences Descriptors - Lilacs Indexer)  and MeSH (Medical Subject Headings - MEDLINE-PubMed Indexer). Please choose  five descriptors that represent your work on these platforms.</p>
      <p><strong>Manuscript  body (Manuscripts submitted to RBGO must have a maximum of 4000 words. Note  that tables, charts and figures in the Results section and References are not  counted).</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Introduction  &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br>
        The <strong>Introduction</strong> section of a scientific article has the purpose of informing what was  researched and the reason for the investigation. This part of the article  prepares the reader to understand the investigation and justification of its  realization. The content informed in this section should provide context or  basis for the study (i.e. the nature of the problem and its importance); state  the specific purpose, research objective, or hypothesis tested in the study or  observation. The study objective usually has a more precise focus when  formulated as a question. Both the primary and secondary objectives should be  clear, and any analyzes in a pre-specified subgroup should be described;  provide strictly relevant references only and do not include data or  conclusions of the work being reported.</p>
      <p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
      <p>According to the Houaiss dictionary, <strong>Methods</strong> &ldquo;is an organized, logical and  systematic process of research&rdquo;. The method comprises the material and procedures  adopted in the research in order to respond to the central research question.  Structure the Methods section of RBGO starting with the study design; research  scenario (place and period in which it was performed); sample of participants;  data collection; intervention to be evaluated (if any) and the alternative  intervention; statistical methods used and the ethical aspects of the study.  When thinking about the writing of the study design, reflect if it is  appropriate to achieve &nbsp;the research  objective, if the data analysis reflects the design, and if what was expected  with use of the design was achieved to research the theme. Following, the  guidelines used in clinical or epidemiological research that should be included  in the section Methods of manuscripts sent to RBGO: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Types of study </strong><strong>(adapted  from Pereira, 2014*): </strong><strong> </strong><br>
            <strong>Case Report (Case study):</strong> In-depth investigation of a situation in which one or  a few people are included (usually up to ten);<br>
            <strong>Case series:</strong> A set of patients (for example, more than ten people)  with the same diagnosis or undergoing the same intervention. In general, these  are consecutive series of patients seen in a hospital or other health  institution for a certain period. There is no internal control group formed  simultaneously. The comparison is made with external controls. The name of  external or historical control is given to the group used to compare the  results, but that was not constituted at the same time within the study: for  example, the case series is compared with patients from previous years.<br>
            <strong>Transversal (or Cross-sectional) study:</strong> Investigation to determine prevalence; examine the  relationship between events (exposure, disease, and other variables of  interest) at any given time. Cause and effect data are collected  simultaneously: for example, the case series is compared with patients from  previous years.<br>
            <strong>Case-control study:</strong> Particular form of etiological investigation of  retrospective approach in which the search of causes starts from the effects.  Groups of individuals, respectively with and without a particular health  problem are compared in relation to past exposures in order to test the hypothesis  that exposure to certain risk factors is the contributing cause of the disease.  For example, individuals afflicted with low back pain are compared with an  equal number of individuals (control group) of the same sex and age, but  without low back pain.<br>
            <strong>Cohort study:</strong> Particular form of investigation of etiological  factors in which the search of effects starts from the cause; therefore, the  opposite of case-control studies. A group of people is identified, and  pertinent information on the exposure of interest is collected, so the group  can be monitored over time, checking those who do not develop the disease in  focus, and if the prior exposure is related to occurrence of disease. For  example, smokers are compared to nonsmoker controls; the incidence of bladder  cancer is determined for each group.<br>
            <strong>Randomized study:</strong> This has the connotation of an experimental study to  evaluate an intervention hence the synonym of <em>intervention study</em>. Can be performed in a clinical setting;  sometimes referred to simply as clinical trial or clinical study. It is also  conducted at the community level. In clinical trials, participants are randomly  assigned to form groups called study (experimental) and control (or testimony),  whether submitted or not to an intervention (for example, a drug or vaccine).  Participants are monitored to verify the occurrence of outcome of interest.  This way, the relationship between intervention and effect is examined under  controlled observation conditions, usually with double-blind evaluation. In the  case of a <strong>randomized study</strong>, inform  the number of the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (REBEC) and/or the  number of the International Clinical Trials Registration Platform (ICTRP/OMS)  on the title page.<br>
            <strong>Ecological study:</strong> Research performed with statistics: the unit of  observation and analysis is not constituted of individuals, but of groups of  individuals hence the synonyms: study of groups, aggregates, clusters,  statistics or community. For example, research on the variation of mortality  coefficients for diseases of the vascular system and per capita consumption of  wine among European countries.<br>
            <strong>Systematic Review and  Meta-analysis:</strong> Type of review in  which there is a clearly formulated question, explicit methods are used to  critically identify, select and evaluate relevant research, and also to collect  and analyze data from the studies included in the review. There is use of  strategies to limit bias in the localization, selection, critical evaluation  and synthesis of relevant studies on a given topic. Meta-analysis may or may  not be part of the systematic review. Meta-analysis is the review of two or  more studies to obtain a global, quantitative estimate of the question or  hypothesis investigated; and employs statistical methods to combine the results  of the studies used in the review.<strong></strong></p>

        <p><strong>Script for statistical review of  original scientific papers</strong><br>
            <strong>Study objective:</strong> Is the study objective sufficiently described,  including pre-established hypotheses?<br>
            <strong>Design:</strong> Is the design appropriate to achieve the proposed objective?<br>
            <strong>Characteristics of the sample:</strong> Is there a satisfactory report on the selection of  people for inclusion in the study? Has a satisfactory rate of responses (valid  cases) been achieved? If participants were followed up, was it long and  complete enough? If there was a pairing (eg. of cases and controls), is it  appropriate? How did you deal with missing data?<br>
            <strong>Data Collection (measurement of results):</strong> Were the measurement methods detailed for each  variable of interest? Is there a description of comparability of the  measurement methods used in the groups? Was there consideration of the validity  and reproducibility of the methods used?<br>
            <strong>Sample size:</strong> Has adequate information on sample size calculation  been provided? Is the logic used to determine the study size described,  including practical and statistical considerations?<br>
            <strong>Statistical Methods:</strong> Was the statistical test used for each comparison  informed? Indicate if the assumptions for use of the test were followed. Was  there information about the methods used for any other analysis? For example,  subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis. Are the main results accompanied by  accuracy of the estimate? Inform the p value and confidence interval. Was the  alpha level informed? Indicate the alpha level below which the results are  statistically significant. Was the beta error informed? Or indicate the  statistical power of the sample. Has the adjustment been made to the main  confounding factors? Were the reasons that explained the inclusion of some and  the exclusion of others described? Is the difference found statistically  significant? Make sure there are sufficient analyzes to show the statistically  significant difference is not due to any bias (eg. lack of comparability  between groups or distortion in data collection). If the difference found is significant,  is it also relevant? Specify the clinically important minimal difference. Make  clear the distinction between statistically relevant difference and relevant  clinical difference. Is it a one- or two-tailed test? Provide this information  if appropriate. What statistical program is used? Inform the reference where to  find it, and the version used.<br>
            <strong>Abstract:</strong> Does the abstract contain the proper article synthesis?<br>
            <strong>Recommendation on the article:</strong> Is the article in acceptable statistical standard for  publication? If not, can the article be accepted after proper review?<strong></strong></p>

      <p><strong>Results</strong><br>
        The purpose of the <strong>Results</strong> section is to show the study findings. It is the original  data obtained and synthesized by the author with the aim to answer the question  that motivated the investigation. For the writing of the section, present the  results in logical sequence in the text, tables and illustrations, first  mentioning the most important findings. Do not repeat all information of the  tables or illustrations in the text. Emphasize or summarize only important  observations. Additional or supplementary materials and technical details may  be placed in an appendix where they will be accessible without interrupting the  flow of the text. Alternatively, this information may be published only in the  electronic version of the Journal. When data are summarized in the results  section, provide numerical results not only in derived values (eg.  percentages), but also in absolute values from which the derivatives were  calculated, and specify the statistical methods used for their analysis. Use  only the tables and figures necessary to explain the argument of the work and  evaluate its foundation. When scientifically appropriate, include data analysis  with variables such as age and sex. Do not exceed the maximum limit of five  tables, five charts or five figures. Tables, charts and/or figures should be  included in the body of the manuscript and do not count the requested limit of  4000 words.</p>
      <p><strong>ATTENTION!</strong><br>
        In <strong>Case Studies</strong>,  the <strong>Methods</strong> and <strong>Results</strong> sections should be replaced by the term <strong>Case Description</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>Discussion</strong><br>
        In the <strong>Discussion</strong> section, emphasize the new and important aspects of the study and the  conclusions derived therefrom. Do not repeat details of data or other  information presented in the introduction or results sections. For experimental  studies, it is useful to begin the discussion by briefly summarizing the main findings,  comparing and contrasting the results with other relevant studies, stating the  limitations of the study, and exploring the implications of the findings for  future research and clinical practice. Avoid claiming precedence and referring  to incomplete studies. Do not discuss data not directly related to the results  of the presented study. Propose new hypotheses when justifiable, but qualify  them clearly as such. In the last paragraph of the Discussion section, cite which  information of your work contributes relatively to advancement of knowledge.</p>
      <p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
        The <strong>Conclusion</strong> section has the function of relating the conclusions to the objectives of the  study, but authors should avoid unfounded statements and conclusions not  adequately supported by data. In particular, authors should avoid making  statements about economic benefits and costs unless their original includes  economic analysis and appropriate data.</p>
      <p><strong>References</strong><br>
      A study is based on the results of other research that  preceded it. Once published, it becomes support for future work on the subject.  In the report of their research, authors state the references of prior works  consulted that they deem pertinent to inform readers, hence the importance of  choosing good References. Properly chosen references lend credibility to the  report. They are a source for convincing readers of the validity of facts and  arguments presented.</p>
      <p>  <strong>Attention!</strong> For manuscripts submitted to RBGO, authors should  number the references in order of entry into the manuscript and use those  numbers for text citations. Avoid excessive references by selecting the most  relevant for each statement and giving preference to the most recent work. Do  not use hard-to-reach quotations, such as abstracts of papers presented at  congresses, theses or restricted publications (non-indexed). Seek to cite the  primary and conventional references (articles in scientific journals and  textbooks). Do not use references such as &lsquo;unpublished observations&rsquo; and  &lsquo;personal communication&rsquo;. Authors&rsquo; publications (self-citation) should be used  only if there is a clear need and relationship with the topic. In this case,  include in bibliographical references only original works published in regular  journals (do not cite chapters or revisions). The number of references should  be 35, in exception review articles. Authors are responsible for the accuracy  of data contained in the references.</p>
