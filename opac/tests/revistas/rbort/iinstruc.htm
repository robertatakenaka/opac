    <p align="left"><em>Ethics in publishing </em><br>
      Please see our  information pages on <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/publishingethics" target="_blank">Ethics in publishing </a>and <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/journal-authors/ethics" target="_blank">Ethical guidelines for journal publication</a>.</p>
    <p align="left"><em>Human and animal rights </em></p>
    <p>If the work involves the use of human subjects, the author should  ensure that the work described has been carried out in accordance with <a href="https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-helsinki-ethical-principles-for-medical-research-involving-human-subjects/" target="_blank">The Code of Ethics  of the World Medical Association </a>(Declaration of Helsinki)  for experiments involving humans; <a href="http://www.icmje.org/" target="_blank">Uniform Requirements for manuscripts submitted to</a> <a href="http://www.icmje.org/">Biomedical journals</a>. Authors  should include a statement in the manuscript that informed consent was obtained  for experimentation with human subjects. The privacy rights of human subjects  must always be observed.
</p>
    <p>All animal experiments should comply with  the local guidelines and the authors  should clearly indicate in the manuscript that such guidelines have been followed. </p>
    <p align="left"><em>Declaration of interest </em><br>
      All  authors must disclose any financial and personal relationships with other  people or organizations that could inappropriately influence (bias) their  work. Examples of potential conflicts of interest include employment, consultancies, stock  ownership, honoraria, paid expert testimony,  patent applications/
registrations, and grants or other funding. Authors must disclose any interests  in two places: 1. A summary declaration of interest statement  in the title page file (if double-blind) or the manuscript file (if single-blind). If there are no interests to declare  then please state this: 'Declarations of interest: none'. This summary  statement will be ultimately published if the article is accepted. 2. Detailed  disclosures as part of a separate Declaration of Interest form,  which forms part of the journal's official records. It is important for  potential interests to be declared in both places and that the information  matches. <a href="http://service.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/286/supporthub/publishing" target="_blank">More information</a>.</p>
    <p><em>Submission  declaration and verification</em><br>
      Submission of an article implies  that the work described has not been published previously (except in the form of an abstract or as part of a published lecture  or academic thesis  or as an electronic preprint, see <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/policies-and-ethics" target="_blank">'Multiple, redundant  or concurrent publication' </a>section of our ethics  policy for more information),  that it is not under consideration for publication elsewhere, that its  publication is approved by all authors and tacitly or explicitly by the  responsible authorities where the work was carried out,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and that, if accepted, it will not be  published elsewhere in the same form, in English or in any&nbsp; other language, including electronically without the written consent  of the copyright-holder. To verify  originality, your article  may be checked by the originality detection  service <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/editors/plagdetect" target="_blank">Crossref Similarity Check</a>.</p>
    <p><em>Contributors</em><br>
      Each author is required to declare his or her  individual contribution to the article:  all authors must  have materially participated in the research and/or article preparation,  so roles for all authors should be described.  The statement that all authors  have approved the final article  should be true and included in the disclosure.</p>
    <p><em>Authorship</em><br>
      All authors should  have made substantial contributions to all of the following: (1) the conception and design of the study, or  acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data, (2) drafting the  article or revising it critically for important intellectual content, (3) final  approval of the version to be submitted. </p>
    <p><em>Changes to  authorship</em><br>
Authors  are expected to consider carefully the list and order of authors <strong>before </strong>submitting their manuscript and  provide the definitive list of authors at the time of the original submission.  Any addition, deletion or rearrangement of author names in the authorship list  should be made only <strong>before </strong>the  manuscript has been accepted and only if approved by the journal  Editor. To request such a change, the Editor must receive the  following from the <strong>corresponding author</strong>:  (a) the reason for the change in author list and (b) written confirmation  (e-mail, letter) from all authors that they agree with the addition, removal or  rearrangement. In the case of addition or removal of authors, this includes  confirmation from the author being added or removed.</p>
    <p>Only in exceptional circumstances will the Editor  consider the addition, deletion or rearrangement of authors <strong>after </strong>the manuscript has been accepted.  While the Editor considers the request, publication of the manuscript will be suspended. If the manuscript has already been published in an online  issue, any requests approved  by the Editor will result  in a corrigendum.    </p>
    <p><em>Copyright </em><br>
      Upon acceptance of an article,  authors will be asked to complete a 'Journal Publishing Agreement' (see <a href="http://www.elsevier.com/copyright" target="_blank">more  information</a> on  this) to assign to the Brazilian Society of Orthopaedics and Traumatology (Sociedade Brasileira de  Ortopedia&nbsp; e Traumatologia SBOT) the  copyright in the manuscript and&nbsp; any  tables, illustrations or other material submitted for publication as part of the  manuscript (the &quot;Article&quot;) in all forms and media (whether now known  or later developed), throughout the world, in all languages, for the full term of copyright, effective when the Article is accepted for publication. An e-mail will be sent to the corresponding  author confirming receipt of the manuscript together with a 'Journal Publishing Agreement' form or a link to the online version  of this agreement.</p>

    <p><strong>PREPARATION</strong> </p>
    <p><em><strong>Double-blind  review</strong></em><br>
This  journal uses double-blind review, which means the identities of the authors are  concealed from the reviewers, and vice versa. <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/reviewers/what-is-peer-review">More information </a>is available on our website. To facilitate this, please include the  following separately:<br>
<em>Title page (with author details): </em>This should include the title, authors' names,  affiliations, acknowledgements and any Declaration of Interest statement, and a  complete address for the corresponding author including an e-mail address.</p>
    <em>Blinded manuscript (no  author details): </em>The main body of the paper  (including the references, figures, tables and any acknowledgements) should not  include any identifying information, such as the authors' names or  affiliations.
    <p><em>Use of word processing software</em></p>
    <p>It is important that the file be saved in the native  format of the word processor used. The text should be in single-column format. Keep the layout of the text as simple  as possible. Most formatting  codes will be removed and replaced on processing the article. In particular, do not use the word  processor's options to justify text or to hyphenate words.  However, do use bold  face, italics, subscripts, superscripts etc. When  preparing tables, if you are using a table grid, use only one grid for each  individual table and not a grid for each row. If no grid is used, use tabs, not spaces, to align columns. </p>
    <p>The electronic text should be prepared in a way very similar  to that of conventional manuscripts (see also the <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/guidepublication" target="_blank">Guide to Publishing with Elsevier</a>). Note that source files of figures,  tables and text graphics  will be required whether or not you embed your figures in the text. See also the section  on Electronic artwork.<br>
      To avoid unnecessary errors you are strongly advised to use the  'spell-check' and 'grammar-check' functions of your word processor.</p>
    <p align="left">Article structure <br>
      <em>Subdivision -  unnumbered sections</em><br>
      Divide your  article into clearly  defined sections. Each subsection is given a brief heading.  Each heading should appear  on its own separate line. Subsections should  be used as much as possible when cross-  referencing text: refer to the subsection by heading as opposed to simply 'the text'.</p>
    <p align="left"><em>Introduction</em><br>
      State the objectives of the work and provide an adequate background,  avoiding a detailed literature survey or a summary of the results.</p>
    <p align="left"><em>Material and methods</em><br>
      Provide  sufficient details to allow the work to be reproduced by an independent researcher. Methods that are already  published should be summarized, and indicated by a reference. If quoting  directly from a previously published method, use quotation marks and also cite the source. Any modifications  to existing methods should also be described.</p>
    <p align="left"><em>Results</em><br>
      Results should be clear and  concise.</p>
    <p align="left"><em>Discussion</em><br>
      This should explore the significance of the results of the work, not  repeat them. Avoid extensive citations and discussion of published literature.</p>
    <p align="left"><em>Conclusions</em><br>
      The main conclusions of the study  may be presented in a short Conclusions section.<br>
      Essential title  page information </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><em>Title. </em></strong>Concise and informative.  Titles are often used in information-retrieval systems. Avoid abbreviations and formulae where possible.</li>
      <li><strong><em>Author names and affiliations. </em></strong>Maximum of six authors. Please clearly indicate  the given name(s) and family name(s) of each  author and check that all names are accurately spelled. Present the authors'  affiliation addresses (where the actual work was done) below the names.  Indicate all affiliations with a lower-case superscript letter immediately  after the author's name and in front of the appropriate address. Provide the  full postal address of each affiliation, including the city, state and country name and, if available, the e-mail  address of each author. Author  affiliations should be presented in decreasing hierarchical order (e.g. Harvard University, Harvard  Business School, Boston, USA) and should be written as established in its own language (e.g.  Universit Paris-Sorbonne; Harvard University, Universidade de So Paulo).</li>
      <li><strong><em>Corresponding author. </em></strong>Clearly indicate  who will handle  correspondence at all stages of refereeing  and publication, also post-publication.Ensure that the e-mail  address is given and that contact details are kept up to date by the corresponding author.</li>
    </ul>
    <p align="left"><em>Structured abstract </em><br>
      A structured abstract, by means  of appropriate headings, should provide the context or background for the  research and should  state its purpose,  basic procedures (selection of study subjects  or laboratory animals,  observational and analytical methods), main findings (giving specific effect  sizes and their statistical significance, if possible), and principal conclusions. It should emphasize new and important aspects of the study or observations.</p>
    <p align="left"><em>Keywords</em><br>
      Immediately  after the abstract, provide a maximum of six, to represent the content of the article.  The descriptors or keywords should  be based on the Health Science  Descriptors (Descritores em Cincias da Sade, DECS),  which are available at the electronic address  http://www.decs.bvs.br; or on the Medical  Subject Headings (MeSH),  from <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/" target="_blank">www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/ </a>MBrowser.html.</p>
    
      <p><em>Acknowledgements</em><br>
        Collate acknowledgements in a separate  section at the end of the article  before the references and do not,  therefore, include them on the title page, as a footnote to the title or  otherwise. List here those individuals who provided help during the research (e.g., providing language help, writing  assistance or proof reading the article, etc.).</p>
      <p><em>Formatting of funding sources</em><br>
        List funding sources in this  standard way to facilitate compliance to funder's requirements:</p>
      <p>Funding: This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health  [grant numbers xxxx, yyyy]; the Bill &amp;  Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, WA [grant  number zzzz]; and the United  States Institutes of Peace  [grant number aaaa].</p>
      <p>It is not necessary  to include detailed  descriptions on the program or type of grants and awards. When funding is from a block grant or  other resources available to a university, college, or other research  institution, submit the name of the institute  or organization that provided the funding.</p>
      <p align="left">If no  funding has been provided for the research, please include the following sentence:</p>
      <p align="left">This research did not receive any specific grant from  funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p>
      <p align="left"><br>
        <em>Artwork </em><br>
        <em>Image manipulation</em><br>
        Whilst  it is accepted that authors sometimes need to manipulate images for clarity, manipulation for purposes of deception or fraud will  be seen as scientific ethical  abuse and will  be dealt with  accordingly. For graphical images,  this journal is applying the following policy:  no specific feature  within an image may be enhanced, obscured, moved, removed,  or introduced. Adjustments of brightness, contrast, or color balance are  acceptable if and as long as they do not obscure or eliminate any information  present in the original. Nonlinear adjustments (e.g. changes to gamma settings)  must be disclosed in the figure legend.</p>
      <p align="left"><br>
        <em>Electronic  artwork <br>
        General points</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure you use uniform  lettering and sizing  of your original  artwork.</li>
        <li>Aim to use the following fonts in your illustrations: Arial, Courier, Times New Roman, Symbol, or use  fonts that look similar.</li>
        <li>Number the illustrations according to their sequence in the text.</li>
        <li>Use a logical naming convention for your artwork  files.</li>
        <li>Provide captions to illustrations separately.</li>
        <li>Size the illustrations close to the desired dimensions of the published  version.</li>
        <li>Submit each illustration as a separate  file.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A detailed <a href="http://www.elsevier.com/artworkinstructions" target="_blank">guide on  electronic artwork </a>is available.</p>
      <p>You are urged  to visit this  site; some excerpts  from the detailed  information are given  here.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><em>Formats</em><br>
          If your electronic artwork is created in a Microsoft Office application  (Word, PowerPoint, Excel) then please supply 'as is' in the native document  format.<br>
          Regardless of the application used other than Microsoft Office, when  your electronic artwork is finalized, please 'Save as' or convert the images to  one of the following formats (note the resolution requirements for line  drawings, halftones, and line/halftone combinations given below):<br>
          EPS (or PDF): Vector drawings,  embed all used fonts.<br>
          TIFF (or JPEG): Color or  grayscale photographs (halftones), keep to a minimum of 300 dpi.<br>
          TIFF (or JPEG): Bitmapped (pure black &amp; white pixels)  line drawings, keep to a minimum of 1000 dpi. TIFF (or JPEG): Combinations  bitmapped line/half-tone (color or grayscale), keep to a minimum of 500 dpi.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>Please do not:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Supply files that are optimized for screen use (e.g., GIF, BMP, PICT,  WPG); these typically have a low number of pixels and limited set of colors;</li>
        <li>Supply files that are too low in resolution;</li>
        <li>Submit graphics that are disproportionately large for the content.</li>
      </ul>
        <p><em>Color artwork</em><br>
        Please  make sure that artwork files are in an acceptable format (TIFF (or JPEG), EPS  (or PDF), or MS Office files) and with the correct resolution. If, together with your accepted article,  you submit usable color figures  then Elsevier will ensure, at no additional charge, that these figures will appear in color online (e.g., ScienceDirect and other sites) regardless of whether or  not these illustrations are reproduced in color  in the printed version. Further  information on the preparation of electronic artwork</p>
        <p><br>
        <em>Illustration services</em><br>
        <a href="http://webshop.elsevier.com/illustrationservices">Elsevier's WebShop</a> offers Illustration Services to  authors preparing to submit a manuscript but concerned about the quality of the  images accompanying their article. Elsevier's expert illustrators can produce  scientific, technical and medical-style images, as well as a full range of  charts, tables and graphs. Image 'polishing' is also available, where our illustrators take your image(s)  and improve them to a professional standard. Please visit the website  to find out more.</p>
        <p><br>
        <em>Figure captions</em><br>
        Ensure  that each illustration has a caption. Supply captions separately, not attached to the figure. A caption should  comprise a brief title (<strong>not </strong>on the figure  itself) and a description of the illustration. Keep text in the illustrations themselves to a minimum  but explain all symbols and abbreviations used.</p>
        <p><br>
          <em>Tables</em><br>
        Please  submit tables as editable text and not as images. Tables can be placed either  next to the relevant text in the article, or on separate page(s) at the end.  Number tables consecutively in accordance with their appearance in the text and  place any table notes below the table body. Be sparing in the use of tables and  ensure that the data presented in them do not duplicate results described  elsewhere in the article. Please avoid using vertical rules and shading in  table cells.</p>
        <p><br>
          <em>References</em><br>
        <em>Citation in text</em><br>
        Please  ensure that every reference cited in the text is also present in the reference  list (and vice versa). Any references cited in the abstract must be given in  full. Unpublished results and personal communications are not recommended in the reference list, but may  be mentioned in the text.  If these references are  included in the reference list they should follow the standard reference style  of the journal and should include a substitution of the publication date with  either 'Unpublished results' or 'Personal communication'. Citation  of a reference as 'in press' implies  that the item has been accepted  for publication.</p>
      <p><br>
          <em>Reference links</em><br>
          Increased  discoverability of research and high quality peer review are ensured by online  links to&nbsp; the sources cited. In order to  allow us to create links to abstracting and indexing services, such as Scopus, CrossRef  and PubMed, please  ensure that data provided in the references are correct. Please note that incorrect surnames,  journal/book titles, publication year and pagination may prevent link creation.  When copying references, please be careful as they may already contain errors.  Use of the DOI is encouraged.</p>
      <p>A DOI can be used to cite and link to electronic articles where an  article is in-press and full citation details are not yet known, but the  article is available online. A DOI is guaranteed never to change, so you can  use it as a permanent link to any electronic article. An example of a citation  using DOI for an article not yet in an issue is: VanDecar J.C., Russo R.M., James  D.E., Ambeh W.B., Franke M. (2003). Aseismic continuation of the Lesser  Antilles slab beneath northeastern Venezuela. Journal of Geophysical Research, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2001JB000884" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1029/2001JB000884</a>. Please note the format of such citations should  be in the same style as all other references in the paper.</p>
      <p><em>Web references</em><br>
      As a minimum, the full URL should be given and the date when the reference was last accessed. Any further information, if known (DOI, author names, dates,  reference to a source publication, etc.), should also be given. Web references can be listed separately (e.g., after the reference list) under a  different heading if desired, or can be included in the reference  list.</p>
      <p><em>Data references</em><br>
      This journal  encourages you to cite underlying or relevant datasets  in your manuscript by citing  them in your text and including a data reference  in your Reference List. Data references should  include the following  elements: author name(s), dataset title, data repository, version (where  available), year, and global  persistent identifier. Add [dataset]  immediately before the reference so we can properly identify it as a data reference. The [dataset] identifier will not appear  in your published  article.</p>
    <p><em>References in a  special issue</em><br>
        Please ensure that the words 'this issue' are added to any references in  the list (and any citations in the text) to other articles in the same Special  Issue.</p>
    <p><em>Reference style</em><br>
        Text:  Indicate references by superscript numbers in the text. The actual authors can  be referred to, but the reference number(s) must always be given. List: Number  the references in the list in the order in which they appear in the text.  Follow the Vancouver Style format, as shown in the models below. For all the  references, cite all the authors up to six. When there are more than six  authors, cite the first six authors, followed by the expression et al.</p>

      <p>Video <br>
      Elsevier  accepts video material and animation sequences to support and enhance your  scientific research. Authors who have video or animation files that they wish  to submit with their article are strongly encouraged to include links to these  within the body of the article. This can be done in the same way as a figure or  table by referring to the video or animation content and noting in the body  text where it should be placed. All submitted files should be properly labeled  so that they directly relate to the video file's  content. . In order to ensure that your video or animation material is directly usable, please provide the file  in one of our recommended file formats with a preferred maximum size of 150 MB  per file, 1 GB in total. Video and animation files supplied will be published  online in the electronic version  of your article  in Elsevier Web products, including <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/" target="_blank">ScienceDirect</a>. Please  supply 'stills' with your files: you can choose any frame from the video  or animation or make a separate image. These will  be used instead  of standard icons  and will personalize the link to your video  data. For more detailed  instructions please visit our <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/artworkinstructions" target="_blank">video instruction pages</a>. Note: since video and animation cannot be embedded in the print  version of the journal, please provide text for both the electronic and the print version  for the portions  of the article that refer to this content.</p>
      <p><br>
        <em>Supplementary material</em><br>
      Supplementary  material such as applications, images and sound clips, can be published with  your article to enhance  it. Submitted supplementary items are published exactly as they  are received (Excel or PowerPoint files will appear  as such online). Please submit your material together with the article and supply a concise,  descriptive caption for each supplementary file. If you wish to make changes  to supplementary material during any stage of the process, please make sure to provide  an updated file. Do not annotate any corrections on a  previous version. Please switch off the 'Track  Changes' option in Microsoft Office  files as these will appear  in the published version.</p>

    <p><strong>AFTER ACCEPTANCE</strong><br>
      <em>Proofs </em><br>
      One set  of page proofs (as PDF files) will be sent by e-mail to the corresponding  author (if we do not have an e-mail address then paper proofs will be sent by  post) or, a link will be provided in  the e-mail so that authors can download the files themselves. Elsevier now  provides authors with PDF proofs which can be annotated; for this you will need  to <a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader">download the free Adobe Reader</a>, version 9 (or higher). Instructions on how to annotate PDF files will  accompany the proofs (also given online). The  exact system requirements are given at the <a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/reader/system-requirements.html">Adobe site</a>.<br>
      If you do not wish to use the PDF annotations function,  you may list the corrections (including replies to the Query Form) and return them to Elsevier in an e-mail.  Please list your corrections quoting  line number. If, for any  reason, this is not possible, then mark the corrections and any other comments  (including replies to the Query Form) on a printout  of your proof and scan the pages and return  via e- mail. Please use this  proof only for checking the typesetting, editing, completeness and correctness  of the text, tables and figures. Significant changes to the article as accepted  for publication will only be considered at this stage  with permission from the Editor. We will do everything possible to get your  article published quickly and accurately. It  is important to ensure that all corrections are sent back to us in one  communication: please check carefully before replying, as inclusion of any  subsequent corrections cannot be guaranteed. Proofreading is solely your responsibility.</p>
