    <blockquote>
      <p><b>Mission:</b></p>
      <p>The journal Revista de Administra&ccedil;&atilde;o Contempor&acirc;nea (RAC) has as its mission to contribute to a deeper understanding of Management by disseminating relevant research articles, theoretical analyses, documents, notes and bibliographic reviews that offer support to academic activities and management actions in public, private and third-sector organizations.</p>
      <p><b>Aims and Scope:</b></p>
      <p>RAC publishes theoretical and theoretical-empirical articles in the areas of Management and Accounting. Different theoretical and methodological perspectives approaching these themes are acceptable, so long as they are consistent and relevant to developing the topic areas (articles based upon single study cases can be accepted if they deal with organizations that are highly representative of their respective sectors or if they offer a significant contribution towards knowledge development). Even though RAC considers articles that contribute to managerial practice, it is not a journal targeting practitioners from the general market, but rather members of the academic community. As such, the journal doesn't accept works that only focus on applying managerial models or techniques in an organizational environment, case studies that don't make a significant contribution to the advancement of theoretical knowledge, or empirical research without clear academic implications. Articles with these profiles should instead be submitted to the journal Tecnologias de Administra&ccedil;&atilde;o e Contabilidade - TAC (Management and Accounting Technologies) at <a href="http://www.anpad.org.br/periodicos/content/frame_base.php?revista=4" target="_blank">http://www.anpad.org.br/periodicos/content/frame_base.php?revista=4</a>. In addition to articles, RAC publishes reviews, bibliographic summaries, and documents for community reflection.</p>
      <p><b>Target Public:</b></p>
      <p>The target public primarily consists of professionals and students from Brazilian academy, and likewise, managers in public, private, and third-sector organizations that are interested in dialogue and innovation in Management and Accounting Sciences.</p>
      <p><b>Requirements:</b></p>
      <p>Articles, documents, notes, and bibliographical reviews submitted for review by RAC should be unpublished nationally or internationally, and not under consideration for publication by any other means of dissemination. Works published in conference annals can be considered by the Editorial Board, so long as they are in the form of a final article. Articles and documents can be composed in Portuguese, English, or Spanish.</p>
      <p><b>Submission:</b></p>
      <p>In order to submit works to RAC, authors should follow all steps and formatting requirements from the Submission Manual found at <a href="http://www.anpad.org.br/rac" target="_blank">www.anpad.org.br/rac</a>, under the link 'Publishing Guidelines'.</p>

    </blockquote>
   <p><b>Analysis of Submitted Texts - Evaluation System</b></p>
   <p>Text submitted to the journal will be sent for evaluation only after it is verified that they meet journal formatting and editorial standards.</p>
   <blockquote>
     <p><b>Articles:</b> Articles are submitted to a triple review system, where the first review is concerned exclusively with evaluating the relevance of submitted articles, their fit within journal scope, and other aspects, such as contribution and novelty for the area they are submitted to. Only the articles editors and reviewers consider relevant for the community, and in particular, for journal readers, advance to further stages of evaluation. After the initial analysis, articles proceed to double blind review.</p>
     <p><b>Documents, Reviews, and Bibliographical Summaries: </b>Documents submitted are analyzed by the Editor in chief, according to editorial policies, without external evaluation.</p>
