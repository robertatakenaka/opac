      <p>Civitas accepts for publication original  articles in Social Sciences, especially Anthropology, Sociology and Political  Sciences, which are not being presented simultaneously in any other journal.  Discussion reviews of works in the area are accepted if they are related to the  thematic core of the respective edition. </p>
<p><b>Peer Review Process</b></p>
<p>Submitted texts undergo a formal initial evaluation by the editorial team, which may request corrections and complements. Texts that do not fall within the scope of the Journal, do not meet mandatory requirements or that are not adequate within the deadline will be archived. Given the admissibility of the submission, as a rule two opinions are requested from persons specialized in the subject, who will serve as a subsidy to the editors, remaining with them the final decision. The publication of papers is conditioned to compliance with their recommendations. Originality, consistency and rigor of the theme's approach, and its contribution to the Social Sciences and the thematic line of the journal are taken into account in the evaluation. The review process is double blind: the names of the referees will remain confidential, and the names of the authors are omitting to the referees.</p>
<p>Reviewers are expected to be objective in their assessment. If there is any conflict of interest or difficulty in formulating a judgment without significant influence of external factors, they should contact the editors. Reviewers are expected to indicate relevant literature if it has not been included in the text. The text and other information made available in the peer-review process must be treated with secrecy and cannot be used for another purpose.</p>
<p><b>Autorship</b></p>
<p>For texts with more than one author, the Editorial Committee of Civitas needs to be informed about the specific contribution of each one in the design of the text, in the collection and interpretation of the data and in the writing.</p>
<p>The Editorial Committee understand that the status of author should be reserved only to those who made a significant intellectual contribution to research and writing. Following the usual practice of the area, the journal accepts as co-authors those who have made a substantial and direct academic contribution in at least two of the following typical components of a scientific research:</p>
<ol type="a"><li>Conception and design;</li>
<li>Collection and processing of data;</li>
<li>Analysis and interpretation of data.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, it is considered essential that each co-author has participated directly and significantly in the writing of parts of the text.</p>
<p>Each person listed as an author must also have read the successive versions of the text and approve the final version, since it is ethically and academically sympathetic to the content.</p>
<p>All those designated as authors should meet all criteria for authorship, and all who meet the criteria should be identified as authors. Those contributors who do not meet criteria for authorship may be acknowledged.</p>
<p>The items that must be included in the document to be sent by the authors are listed in the above document "DECLARATION OF CO-AUTHORSHIP" (Please fill out a statement for each co-author):</p> 
<p>When a submitted text has more than one author, each participant must complete a declaration containing:</p>
<ol type="a"><li>Identification of the text: Title of the text; name of co-authors;</li>
<li>Identification of the co-author: Name, nationality, identity document, full address;</li>
<li>Description of the specific participation in:</li>
      <ol><li>research conception and design;</li>
      <li>data collection and processing;</li>
      <li>data analysis and interpretation;</li>
      <li>detailing their collaboration in the final text;</li></ol>
      <li>Declaration that approves the final version and assumes the ethical and academic co-responsibility for the completeness of its content.</li>
<li>Place, date and signature</li>

</ol>
<p>This document should be attached in PDF format as a supplementary document, leaving unchecked the option "Enable document to evaluators".</p>
<p>Texts with a maximum of 3 authors, with similar qualifications, not lower than PhD in progress, will be accepted.</p>
<p>The Editorial Committee of Civitas reserves the right to accept or not to be the co-author for the respective participants so declared.</p>
<p><b>Conflicts of Interests</b></p>
<p>Competing interests may be personal, financial, intellectual, professional, political or religious in nature, and may occur with authors, reviewers and editors. Perceptions of conflict of interest are as important as actual conflicts of interest.</p>
<p><em>Authors</em></p>
<p>Whenever a relationship exists between authors and any public or private organization, which may generate a conflict of interest, this possibility must be communicated and will be included in the article. In case that a conflict does not exist, this should be mentioned.</p>
<p><em>Reviewers</em></p> 
<p>In the peer-review system used by Civitas, the manuscript is sent to the reviewer without author's identification. However, if the reviewer recognizes the authors or the institution, there could be a perceived conflict of interest. To maintain the impartiality of the peer-review process, the reviewer should determine whether the manuscript can be judged impartially. If there is any perceived competing interest, the reviewer should immediately inform the editor, so another reviewer will be designed.</p>
<p><em>Editors</em></p>
<p>Editors should not have any conflict of interest with respect to manuscripts and authors. Perceptions of conflict of interest are as important as actual conflicts of interest.</p>
<p><b>Copyright Notice</b></p>
<p>The submission of originals to this journal implies the transfer by the authors of the right for printed and digital publication. Authors retain copyright and grant the journal right of first publication. If the authors wish to include the same data into another publication, they must cite this journal as the site of original publication. As the journal is of open access, the articles are allowed for free use, in scientific, educational, non-commercial applications, with citation of the source (please see the Creative Commons License at the bottom of this page).</p>
<p><b>Correction of Errors and Retractions</b></p>
<p>After the publication, the authors should notify the editor if any error is identified, in order to publish an erratum, addendum or notice.</p>
<p>In the event that editors are made aware of any allegation of research misconduct, the publisher or editor will deal with allegations appropriately. </p>
<p>Civitas follow the guidelines of COPE for retracting or correcting articles. Publisher and editors are willing to publish corrections, clarifications, retractions and apologies when needed. Reasonable steps will be taken to identify and prevent publication of papers with errors or where research misconduct has occurred.</p>
<p><b>Confidentiality</b></p>
<p>The manuscript in review is a privileged document, and will be protect from any form of exploitation. The editorial team and the reviewers are instructed not to cite a manuscript before it is published and not to distribute or use the information it contains for the advancement of their own research. During review, the manuscript should neither be shown to nor discussed with others, and no one else should be involved in the review, except, in special cases, persons from whom specific advice may be sought. In that event, the reviewer maintains responsibility for ensuring confidentiality. The reviewer should inform the editor of others who make significant contributions to a review.</p>

      <p>The author&rsquo;s name  should not be in the body of the text nor in the document properties, thus  ensuring anonymity in the evaluation and selection process. Files are sent in  plain text, without sophisticated formatting, through the journal&rsquo;s homepage  (<a href="http://revistaseletronicas.pucrs.br/ojs/index.php/civitas">http://revistaseletronicas.pucrs.br/ojs/index.php/civitas</a>).
