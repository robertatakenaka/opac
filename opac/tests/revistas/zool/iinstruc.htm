    <td width="70%"><p><strong>Scope. ZOOLOGIA</strong>, the scientific journal of the Sociedade Brasileira de Zoologia (SBZ), publishes  original articles on Zoology authored by both members and non-members of the Society.  Manuscripts should have a scientific character. <em>A priori, </em>the following types  of articles are not acceptable for publication: simple occurrence notes, new records  (e.g.geographical, host),  notes on distribution, case studies, species lists, or merely descriptive studies,  unless very well qualified by the authors. Justifications should be sent to the  Editor-in-Chief before submission. Short communications are acceptable, whereas  review articles will be considered by direct invitation. Manuscripts will be analyzed  by at least two <em>ad hoc</em> Reviewers, and the decision to accept or reject the  manuscript will be based on the recommendations by the Subject Editor and the <em>ad  hoc</em> Reviewers.</p>
    <p><strong>Responsibility.</strong> For a manuscript to be submitted to <strong>ZOOLOGIA</strong>, it is required that:  1) all authors approved the submission; 2) the results or opinions therein are original;  3) the manuscript has not been published before, is not currently under review by  other journal, and will not be submitted elsewhere unless it was rejected by <strong>ZOOLOGIA</strong> or removed from the reviewing process by written notification to the Editor-in-Chief;  4) it was prepared according to the Instructions to Authors (<a href="https://zoologia.pensoft.net/about%23Author-Guidelines">https://zoologia.pensoft.net/about#Author-Guidelines</a>); 5) if accepted for publication and published, the article or part of it  will not be published elsewhere unless there is written permission by the Editor-in-chief;  6) the reproduction and use of articles published in <strong>ZOOLOGIA</strong> is allowed  for demonstrated educational and non-commercial purposes. All remaining uses require  agreement and fees will be applied when appropriate; 7) the publication and page  charges and review fees are agreed upon by the authors; 8) the authors are entirely  responsible for the scientific and grammatical content of the article; 9) the authors  agree with additional fees whenever a revision of the English grammar is deemed  necessary.</p>
    <p><strong>Language.</strong> The manuscript should be written exclusively  in English. To avoid delays in publication, we suggest that, before it is submitted,  the manuscript should be reviewed by a specialist in the field who is a native speaker.  After recommendation for publication, the manuscript will be reviewed and a final  revision of the language might be requested.</p>
    <p><strong>Sections.</strong> Opinion, Review, Research  Articles (Systematics and evolution, Taxonomy and nomenclature, Biogeography, Morphology  and physiology, Biology, Ecology, Symbiosis, Conservation, Behavior, Genetics) and,  Short Communication.</p>
    <p><strong>Article processing charges  (fees).</strong> Zoologia publishes original scientific articles  on Zoology, authored by members and non-members of the Society. The Brazilian Zoological  Society will subsidize one article/year for long-standing members of the society  (at least 4 years) and with partial subsidy to the remaing members with less than  four years of membership. Non-members have the option either to cover the Article  Processing Charges of EURO 450 per article of up to 20 published pages, or request  the Brazilian Zoological Society for discount or waiver before submission. The detailed  payment policies are also published in the Society’s homepage (<a href="http://sbzoologia.org.br/revista-zoologia.php%20" target="_blank">http://sbzoologia.org.br/revista-zoologia.php</a> – item Page Charges).</p>
    <p><strong>Submission.</strong> Only online submissions will be accepted, through  the following address:  <a href="https://zoologia.pensoft.net" target="_blank">https://zoologia.pensoft.net</a>. Using this submission system, you can submit the manuscript and monitor  its status during the editorial process, ensuring speed and privacy in the manuscript  submission and accelerating the review process.<br>
The manuscript should be prepared according to  the Author Guidelines.</p>
    <p>When submitting a manuscript to the journal, the authors should acknowledge  that, if accepted for publication, all content of the journal, except where identified,  will be licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a> attribution-type BY.

    <td width="70%"><p><strong>GENERAL ORIENTATIONS</strong> <br>
ZOOLOGIA, the journal of the Sociedade Brasileira  de Zoologia (SBZ), publishes original scientific articles on Zoology, authored by  members and non-members of the Society. Members of the SBZ can publish free of charge,  whereas non-members are required to pay page charges, as indicated in the updated  price list published in the Society’s homepage (<a href="http://sbzoologia.org.br/revista-zoologia.php%20" target="_blank">http://sbzoologia.org.br/revista-zoologia.php</a> – item Page Charges).<br>
Manuscripts should be prepared solely in American  English. Manuscript submission to ZOOLOGIA is available online only at <a href="https://zoologia.pensoft.net" target="_blank">https://zoologia.pensoft.net</a>. The system is user-friendly and allows authors to monitor the submission  process. All documents should be prepared with a word-processor software (preferably  MS Word or compatible).</p>
    <p>ZOOLOGIA refrains from publishing simple occurrence notes, new records (e.g.  geographic, host), distribution notes, case studies based on observation of few  specimens, list of species, and similar purely descriptive studies, unless well  justified by the authors. Justification should be sent prior submission to the Managing  Editor.</p>
    <p><strong>RESPONSIBILITY</strong> <br>
      Manuscripts are received by ZOOLOGIA with the  understanding that:<br>
      – all authors have approved submission;<br>
      – the results or ideas contained therein are original;<br>
      – the paper is not under consideration for publication elsewhere and will not be  submitted elsewhere unless rejected by ZOOLOGIA or withdrawn by written notification  to the Managing Editor;<br>
      – the manuscript has been prepared according to these instructions to authors;<br>
      – if accepted for publication and published, the article, or portions thereof, will  not be published elsewhere unless consent is obtained in writing from the Managing  Editor;<br>
      – reproduction and fair use of articles in ZOOLOGIA are permitted provided the intended  use is for nonprofit educational purposes. All other use requires consent and fees  where appropriate;<br>
      – the obligation for page charges and text revision fees is accepted by the authors.<br>
      – the authors are fully responsible for the scientific content and grammar of the  article.<br>
      – the authors agree with additional fees associated with English revisions, if necessary.</p>
    <p><strong>AUTHOR GUIDELINES</strong></p>
    <p>Before proceeding with submission, authors should consult and follow the  detailed instructions for formatting the manuscript at <a href="https://zoologia.pensoft.net/about%23AuthorGuidelines" target="_blank">https://zoologia.pensoft.net/about#AuthorGuidelines</a></p>
    <p><strong>EVALUATION PROCEDURES</strong></p>
    <p>Manuscripts submitted to ZOOLOGIA will be initially evaluated by the Administrative  Editor for adequacy (for the scope) and formatting. A first evaluation of the English  (if it is the case) is performed also at this moment by the Language Editor. Manus­cripts  with problems may be returned to the authors. The Administrator forwards the manuscript  to the Managing Editor which will the adequate Section Editor. The Subject Editor  sends the manuscript to Reviewers. The copies of the manuscript with the Reviewers’  comments and the Section Editor’s decision will be returned to the corresponding  author for evaluation. The authors have up to 30 days to respond or comply with  the revision and return revised version of the manuscript to the adequate area of  the electronic system. Once approved, the original manuscript, Reviewers comments,  Section Editor’s comments, together with the corrected version and the respective  figure files, properly identified, are returned to the Managing Editor. Exceptionally,  the Managing Editor may, after consultation with the Subject Editors, modify the  recommendation of the Reviewers and Subject Editor, based on adequate justification.  Later changes or additions to the manuscript may be rejected. A copyedited version  of the manuscript is sent to authors for approval. This version represents the last  chance for the author to make any substantial changes to the text, as the next stage  is restricted to typographic and formatting corrections. Electronic proofs will  be submitted to the corresponding author prior to publication for approval. </p>
    <p><strong>REPRINTS</strong></p>
    <p>The corresponding author will receive an electronic reprint (in PDF format)  after publication. Authors may print and distribute hardcopies of their article  on demand. Authors may also send the electronic file to individuals, as one would  send a printed reprint. However, we would appreciate if you refrain from distributing  PDF files via discussion groups and bulk-mail systems. It is important for ZOOLOGIA  that users access the journal homepage at <a href="https://zoologia.pensoft.net/articles" target="_blank">https://zoologia.pensoft.net/articles</a> or <a href="http://www.scielo.br/zool" target="_blank">www.scielo.br/zool</a> for statistical purposes. By doing this, you are helping increase the indexes  of quality of ZOOLOGIA. Hardcopies of articles can be purchase at <a href="https://zoologia.pensoft.net" target="_blank">https://zoologia.pensoft.net</a>.
</p>
    <p><strong>VOUCHER AND TYPE SPECIMENS</strong></p>
Specimens including types (where appropriate) or vouchers that have received  authoritative identification are the foundations for all biological studies from  taxonomy and systematics to ecology and biogeography and including all aspects of  biodiversity survey and inventory. Representative individuals (or parts of entire  specimens that retain diagnostic information for identification) used in any study  reported in the Journal should be deposited in a recognized biological collection,  so that such are freely available to the research community. Vouchers should also  be deposited to substantiate records of sequence data in all molecular studies (e.g.,  phylogeography and diagnostics), and ideally the physical voucher should be the  remaining portion(s) of individual specimens that have been processed for DNA extraction.  It is recommended that such specimens not be limited to the holotype and a limited  number of paratypes in descriptions, or relatively few specimens derived from survey  or from ecological studies. It is a requirement of ZOOLOGIA that all manuscripts  must document the collection(s) where the specimens (types or vouchers) are deposited  along with their respective catalogue or accession numbers in those repositories.
