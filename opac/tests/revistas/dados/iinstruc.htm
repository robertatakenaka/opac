 <td width="70%"><p><strong>1. </strong>DADOS<strong></strong><em>-</em><strong> </strong><em>Revista  de Ci&ecirc;ncias Sociais</em> is open to the submission of  unpublished manuscripts in the field of social sciences that contribute to  theoretical or methodological innovation and/or empirical analysis. We are keen  in fostering contributions that are thematically and conceptual plural, of  academic and social relevance and written in an intelligible manner for an  educated readership. Cross-cutting discussions that contribute to debates in  Brazil and Latin/Iberian America will be favored as the main, yet not  exclusive, geo-cultural space of internationalization.</p>
   <p>     <strong>2. </strong>DADOS will  only accept original pieces stemming from scientific research. We will not  publish: commentary on conjuncture, reviews, bibliographical essays, case  reports, research notes or translations. DADOS does not place calls for papers  of special calls, as it adopts and open and ongoing system of submissions.</p>
   <p>       <strong>3. </strong>The  submission of a manuscript to DADOS implies that it has not been previously  published or has not been simultaneously submitted to another periodical.</p>
   <p><strong>4.</strong> The core fields of the journal are Political Science and Sociology. However, we  strongly stimulate diversity and inter-discipline dialogue from all fields  within the Social and Human Sciences, especially Public Administration,  Anthropology, Law, Economics, Education, History, Urban and Regional Planning  and International Relations.</p>
   <p>     <strong>5.</strong> The manuscripts can be submitted in Portuguese, Spanish, English, and French,  however they will only be published in Portuguese, Spanish and English. In the  latter case, depending on the article's content and the final decision of the  Editorial Board, the publication can occur simultaneously in Portuguese and  English.</p>
   <p>     <strong>6.</strong> The publication of articles is conditioned to the peer review of members of the  journal's Scientific Committees, of which there are three: an <em>Editorial Board </em>(comprising the editors  of the journal and renowned researchers, similar to "associated editors," who  convene periodically to take decisions, actively contributing in the editorial  process and evaluation); the <em>Scientific  Board </em>(constituted by leading experts in their respective fields in Brazil  and abroad, whose function is to aid the Editorial Board) and the <em>Consultative Board </em>(comprised of <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers with proven expertise  based in Brazil and abroad) which is responsible for aiding the editors in  taking decisions concerning the received articles and thereby contributing to  assure quality and scientific rigor.</p>
   <p>     <strong>7.</strong> The manuscripts received are submitted to a three-tiered evaluation system: the <em>first filter</em>, carried out by the  Editor-in-Chief, supported by the Editorial Assistant, is strictly formal in  nature, and evaluates whether the manuscript received conforms to the scope  defined by DADOS. If the answer is negative, a letter is drafted and sent  explaining the motives of refusal. If the answer is positive, it appoints <em>ad hoc </em>reviewers, always PhD holders  with proven expertise in the subject. Lastly, the <em>third filter</em> is carried out by the Consultative Board, which,  always based on double-blind evaluations, assists the Editor-in-Chief in the  final decision, which is then communicated by letter.</p>
   <p>     <strong>8.</strong> The decision letter sent by the Editor-in-Chief can: i) accept the article for  publication, with or without revisions; ii) suggest the text be resubmitted for  consideration upon the completion of substantive revisions, or iii) deny  publication. In case the text is submitted to a new evaluation, DADOS will  process a maximum of two re-evaluations before taking a definitive decision.</p>
   <p>     <strong>9</strong>.  The approximate time for a final decision is 2 months in the case of articles  that are rejected in the first of second filter and 6 months in the case of  articles sent to <em>ad hoc </em>reviewers.  This average time is calculated based on the dates of submission and final  decision concerning publication. In the case of articles approved, in order to  assure to shortest possible delay between approval and publication, DADOS will  publish part of the articles ahead of print.</p>
   <p>     <strong>10</strong>.  The approved manuscripts will be submitted to copydesk and returned to the  author for the approval of such suggested modifications. Upon approval, the  manuscript will undergo final diagramming and composition. At this time, no  further additions or modifications will be accepted. The editors reserve  themselves the right to carry out modifications or exclusions / cuts in order to  adequate them to guidelines, respecting the original content and the style of  the author, whom will always be consulted. Following publication of the  article, each author will receive two copies of the edition.</p>
   <p>     <strong>11.</strong> The author is responsible for the data (which must always be available for  consultation after the publication), analyses and opinions contained in the  article.</p>
   <p><strong>12.</strong> <em>Dados</em> adopts the principles of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), (<a href="http://www.publicationethics.org/" target="_blank">http://www.publicationethics.org/</a>),  of the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&iacute;fico e Tecnol&oacute;gico (<a href="http://www.cnpq.br/web/guest/diretrizes" target="_blank">http://www.cnpq.br/web/guest/diretrizes</a>)  and of the <strong>Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o de Amparo &agrave; Pesquisa do Estado de S&atilde;o Paulo</strong>(<a href="http://www.fapesp.br/boaspraticas/" target="_blank">http://www.fapesp.br/boaspraticas/</a>).</p>

 <td width="70%"><p><strong>1.</strong> Manuscripts are to be exclusively submitted through the <em>Scholar One Manuscripts </em>platform. The DADOS Scielo website (<a href="http://www.scielo.br/dados" target="_blank">http://www.scielo.br/dados</a>) provides a  link to this platform, which can also be accessed directly at <a href="https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/dados-scielo" target="_blank">https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/dados-scielo</a>.  In the submission process, the author must follow the instructions provided  here and in the online platform.</p>
   <p>     <strong>2.</strong> In case of multiple authors, the text must be submitted by the first author (or  contact author). In case of approval, all authors must express endorsement of  the manuscript to be published. The journal does not accept articles with more  than three authors, save for exceptional cases that must be justified to the  Editor-in-Chief.</p>
   <p><strong>3. </strong>The extension of manuscripts may range between 9,000  and 11,000 words, and must be submitted in Times New Roman font, size 12, 1.5  space and justified paragraphs. The abstract, no more than 200 words, must be  submitted in the original language of the article (in case of approval, DADOS  will take care of the translation of the abstracts into Portuguese, Spanish,  French, and English), clearly and synthetically outlining the purpose, methods  employed, and main conclusions of the work, along with 5 keywords.</p>
   <p>       <strong>4.</strong> For online  submissions, two archives in .<em>doc</em> or  .<em>docx</em> format must be attached: <br>
     -  the <em>first archive</em>, exclusively  addressed to the Editor-in-Chief as a <em>cover  letter</em>, must include the title of the article, abstract and a short  biographic note on the author(s) (academic degrees, current position and most  relevant recent publications). This archive can also contain comments and  justifications addressed to the Editor-in-Chief concerning any aspect related  to the article's processing. Information that reveals the manuscript's author  and acknowledgments can also be included. <br>
     -  the <em>second archive </em>is the main  document, the <em>main version of the  manuscript</em> that will be read by designated peer reviewers. For this reason  this archive must be submitted with no references or information that might  reveal the identity of the authors. The only elements contained should be the  title, the text and bibliographical references.</p>
   <p>  <strong>5.</strong> Graphs and  tables must be accompanied by respective spreadsheets. The units values are  expressed in and sources must be clearly indicated. High-resolution images  should be attached separately, and not within the main document.</p>
   <p>        <strong>6. </strong>Inquiries  concerning the submissions or evaluation processes must be directed to our  institutional e-mail: <a href="mailto:dados@iesp.uerj.br" target="_blank">dados@iesp.uerj.br</a> <strong></strong></p>
   <p><strong>7. </strong>Notes must  be substantive in nature, limiting themselves to additional comments to the  text.</p>
   <p>  <strong>8.</strong> Bibliographical references, when necessary, must appear in the body of the  text, with the author's last name mentioned followed by the year of publication  and the number of the page, when needed (Lynch, 2014:97). Literal citation of  texts by other authors longer than three lines must appear as a separate  paragraph, in italics. </p>
   <p><strong>9.</strong> All bibliographical references cited in the  text must appear at the end of the article, in alphabetical order, following  the format below:</p>
