      <p>Soldagem &amp; Inspe&ccedil;&atilde;o is intended primary to Professional and research 

        from Portuguese and Spanish speaking countries. Papers written in Portuguese, 

        Spanish and English are accepted. All submitted papers are initially evaluated 

        by one of the Associate Editors. Papers approved by the Associate Editor 

        are further evaluated by the Editorial Board, and have to receive at least 

        two favorable reviews from its members to be accepted for publication. 

        Some papers, particularly those covering more specialized areas, can be 

        reviewed by "ad hoc" reviewers. All process is supervised by the Editor-in-Chief. 

        Submitted papers should not have be published or submitted to another 

        journal, except for special cases (invited papers, see below). There are 

        no fixed dates for paper submission. The time interval between submission 

        and paper approval for publication is around 3 to 10 months. Submission 

        and acceptance dates are indicated in the first page of published papers.</p>

      <p>Members of the Editorial Board evaluate all submitted papers considering, 

        among others, relevance of the subject, originality and presentation. 

        Their point of view is summarized in a standard form identifying the paper 

        and finishing with one of the following conclusions:</p>

      <p>Paper not recommended for publication </p>

      <p>Paper recommended for publication with restrictions, and</p>

      <p>Paper recommended for publication without restrictions.</p>

      <p>The Soldagem &amp; Inspe&ccedil;&atilde;o, (S&amp;I) journal accepts papers that 

        belong to one of the following categories:</p>

      <p>- Scientific Papers: These should present results obtained by scientific 

        methodologies in fields related to welding, inspection and related processes.</p>

      <p>- Reviews: Papers that, based on what has been published in the literature, 

        present the evolution and state of the art in fields related to welding, 

        inspection and related processes.</p>

      <p>- Invited Papers: These include scientific or informative papers that 

        are considered of particular interest for the readers of S&amp;I. They 

        are, generally, papers published or presented in Congresses or Journals 

        by well known researchers or personalities in fields related to welding, 

        inspection and related processes. Conditions for publication of an invited 

        paper include the acceptance of the invitation by its authors and the 

        agreement from the entities responsible for the Congress or Journal that 

        originally published the paper. </p>

      <p>- Technological Challenges: Scientific papers or letters that center 

        on subjects that can boost the advance of the knowledge of some welding 

        and inspection aspects, which has not been completely understood or accepted. 

        In this sense, these aspects can be considered as challenges. The papers 

        are expected to contradict or support those aspects by using new methodologies 

        or bringing alternative arguments. Therefore, it is not demanded that 

        papers present conclusive results and a well defined study, i.e., a lesser 

        scientific rigor is accepted. However, the paper should contain at least 

        a seed of a new knowledge. It is expected that the paper should contribute 

        to the discussion of polemic subjects and stimulate other authors, through 

        new papers or letters, to contribute to the subject or expose faults of 

        the approach that was presented. </p>

      <p>- Technological Advances: Technological papers or letters that present 

        recent advances in, for instance, equipment design, processes and techniques. 

        The idea is to bring to our readers information related to innovative 

        advances and their potential contributions of welding, inspections and 

        related processes. Although these papers are of technological divulgation, 

        those considered as advertisement of a product or divulgation of an entity 

        or company will not be accepted. Therefore, the names of products or companies 

        should be avoided or placed just once in the introduction. </p>

      <p>- Editorials: Piece of text that opens a new issue of S&amp;I. It should 

        occupy no more than one page of the journal. The editorial should express 

        the opinion of its authors concerning today technical or social subjects 

        that are relevant the fields of interest of the S&amp;I and/or their future 

        outcomes.</p>

      <p><b>1. Introduction</b></p>

      <p>The Soldagem &amp; Inspe&ccedil;&atilde;o (S&amp;I) journal is the scientific divulgation 

        channel of the Brazilian Welding Association (ABS). It aims to publish 

        original papers related to the scientific and technological development 

        of welding, inspection, and related fields. Review papers or letters on 

        current and controversial subjects are also published in the Journal. 

        Papers presented in the Welding Brazilian Congress, sponsored by the Brazilian 

        Welding Association (CONSOLDA-ABS), receive priority to be published in 

        the S&amp;I Journal. However, papers directly submitted to the Journal 

        are also welcomed. All submitted papers are evaluated by an Editorial 

        Board, and have to receive at least two favorable reviews from its members 

        to be accepted for publication. Soldagem &amp; Inspe&ccedil;&atilde;o is released every 

        trimester and it is distributed mainly in Spanish and Portuguese spoken 

        countries.</p>

      <p>For this reason, it publishes papers written in those languages, and 

        in English. It is distributed exclusively to ABS members and, as a donation, 

        to libraries in universities, colleges, research institutions, and companies 

        linked to the welding and inspection fields. Authors must sign the Copyright 

        Transfer Form before their paper is published in the S&amp;I Journal. 

        It is also implied that the authors should answer to any demand resulting 

        from conflicts with other authors, institutions, and companies related 

        to their paper.</p>

        (i.e.: 2.1. Numerical Analysis). The introduction establishes the need 

        for the research work, what is known about the subject, and what is still 

        unclear. It should not repeat what was already presented in the abstract.</p>

      <p>Authors are free to organize their paper in different forms. However, 

        the Editorial Board of S&amp;I may require alterations if the paper is 

        considered to be miss-organized.</p>

      <p><b>2. Methodology</b></p>
