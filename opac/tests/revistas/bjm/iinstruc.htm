  <td width="70%"><p>As from 01/01/2015, the Brazilian Journal of  Microbiology will be accepting texts annoncing new publically available genomes  in our new &quot;Genome Announcements&quot; section. The purpose of this  section is to allow authors of a genome submission to inform the readers of BJM  that a novel complete genome sequence of a microbiological organism is now  publically available and of interest to the scientific community. The genome  announcement does not preclude future publication of a detailed full scientific  paper later in BJM or elsewhere. The scope for Genome Announcements in BJM is  outlined below:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The authors of the Genome  Announcement must be the same (or mostly the same) authors as the genome  sequence deposit;</li>
      <li>The genome sequence must be  publically available at the time of Genome Announcement submission in  DDBJ/EMBL/NCBI GenBank (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank</a>). A valid GenBank accession number for the genome must be clearly  stated in the manuscript;</li>
      <li>Communication of complete genomes  of viruses, phages, bacteria, archaea, fungi and protozoa will be considered;<strong> </strong></li>
      <li>Complete sequences of gapless  circular plasmids will also be accepted;<strong> </strong></li>
      <li>The nucleotide sequences referred  to must cover at least 95% of the predicted genome size for the organism;<strong> </strong></li>
      <li>GenBank deposits pertaining  complete (gapless) chromosomes, gapped (scaffolded) chromosomes and genome  assemblies will be considered. It is desirable for these deposits to contain  functional annotation;<strong> </strong></li>
      <li>The manuscript for the Genome  Announcement must contain up to 500 words in the body text plus a 150 word  abstract;<strong> </strong></li>
      <li>The authors must clearly state  the origin of the strain, the importance of having sequenced the genome and the  advantages the availability of the sequence will have to the field of  microbiology;<strong> </strong></li>
      <li>The text must contain sequencing  methodology, including number and size of reads generated, assembly methods  used, steps taken for scaffolding and genome finishing, when applicable, and  methods used for feature annotation and curation if carried out;<strong> </strong></li>
    </ul>
    Acceptability  for publication will be dependent on the same peer-review system currently used  for other types of publication in BJM, so having a working GenBank accession  number is no guarantee of publication in BJM.
    <p>Brazilian Journal of Microbiology, published by the Bra­zilian Society of Microbiology, publishes original research papers and reviews, covering all aspects of Microbiology. The publication fee for this journal is <strong>USD 300 </strong>for non-Brazilian citizens, <strong>R$ 840,00 </strong>for Brazilian citizens and <strong>USD 100 </strong>for Genome Announcements.</p>
    <p>The following categories of papers are acceptable for publication in 
    
    Brazilian Journal of Microbiology:</p>
   <ul type=disc>
    <li><b><i>Research paper</i></b><b>: </b>the research paper reports results 
     
     of original research, which has not been published elsewhere.</li>
    <li><b><i>Mini-review</i></b><b>: </b>Review articles should deal with 
     
     microbiological subjects of broad interest. </li>
   </ul>
   <p>Your manuscript must be written in clear, comprehensible English.  </p>
   <p>If you have concerns about the level of English in your submission, you may choose to have your manuscript professionally edited by a native English speaker or a scientific editing service prior to submission to improve the English. All services are to be arranged and paid for by the author, and use of one of these services does not guarantee acceptance or preference for publication. In the case of the author being a native English speaker, please replace the certificate of English editing service by a justification letter.</p>
   <p>The text of articles accepted for publication,  should be submitted to a review of the English language by American Journal  Experts. To publish, you must send to BJM the certificate issued by them.</p>

   <p>Authors may need, or wish, to use professional language editing services

   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <p><b>ORGANIZATION</b></p>
   <p>The <b>Title </b>should be a brief as possible, contain no abbreviations 
    
    and be truly indicative of the subject of the paper.</p>
   <p>Expressions like "Effects of", "Influence of", "Study on", etc, should 
    
    be avoided. Care should be exercised in preparing the title since it is 
    
    used in literature retrieval systems.</p>
   <p>The <b>Abstract </b>should summarize the basic content of the paper. 
    
    The abstract should be meaningful without reference to the text. An abstract 
    
    should not contain references, tables or unusual abbreviations. Abstracts 
    
    are reprinted by abstracting</p>
   <p>journals and therefore will be read by persons who do not have access 
    
    to the entire paper.</p>
   <p>The <b>Introduction </b>should provide the reader with sufficient information 
    
    so that the results reported in the paper can be properly evaluated without 
    
    referring to the literature. However, the introduction should not be an 
    
    extensive review of the</p>
   <p>literature. The introduction should also give the rationale for and objectives 
    
    of the study that is being reported.</p>
   <p>The <b>Materials and Methods </b>section should provide enough information 
    
    for other investigators to repeat the work.</p>
   <p>Repetition of details of procedures which have already been published 
    
    elsewhere should be avoided. If a published method is modified, such modification(s) 
    
    must be described in the paper. Sources of reagents, culture media and 
    
    equipment (company, city, state, country) should be mentioned in the text. 
    
    Names that are registered trade marks should be so indicated. Subheading 
    
    often makes this section easier to read and understand.</p>
   <p>The <b>Results </b>section should, by means of text, tables and/or figures, 
    
    give the results of the experiments. If a <i>Discussion </i>section is 
    
    to be included, avoid extensive interpretation of results but do so in 
    
    the <i>Discussion </i>section. If <i>Results </i>and <i>Discussion </i>are 
    
    combined, then results should be discussed where, in the text, is the 
    
    more appropriate. Tables and figures should be numbered using Arabic numerals. 
    
    All tables and figures must be mentioned in the text.</p>
   <p>The approximate location of tables and figures in the text should be 
    
    indicated.</p>
   <p>The <b>Discussion </b>section should discuss the results in relation 
    
    to the literature cited.</p>
   <p>The <b>References s</b>hould be in alphabetical order, by last name of the first author. All authors must be cited. The citations in the text have to be written by the last name(s) of the author(s), followed by the year of publication. As an example, see below: "...while Silva and Pereira (1987) observed that resistance depended on soil density" or "It was observed that resistance depended on soil density (Silva and Pereira, 1987)." For two or more papers by the same author(s) in a citation, list them chronologically, with the years separated by commas (example: Freire-Maia <i>et al</i>., 1966a, 1966b, 2000; Hene 2010; Padonou <i>et al</i>., 2012). Journal names should be abbreviated according to the style of <i>BIOSIS</i>. All references given in the list should be cited in the text and all references mentioned in the text should be included in the list.</p>

<p><b>Conflicts of Interest</b></p>
<p>It is Brazilian Journal of Microbiology policy that everyone involved 
    
    in the publication process (authors, reviewers, editorial board members, 
    
    and editorial staff) must be free from conflicts of interest that could 
    
    adversely influence their judgment, objectivity or loyalty to the article 
    
    and assignments. The BJM recognizes that any potential conflict of interest 
    
    raised must be disclosed promptly to Editor. Conflicts of interest in 
    
    publishing can be defined as conditions in which an individual holds conflicting 
    
    or competing interests that could bias editorial decisions. Conflicts 
    
    of interest may be only potential or perceived, or they may be factual. 
    
    Personal, political, financial, academic, or religious considerations 
    
    can affect objectivity in numerous ways.</p>
