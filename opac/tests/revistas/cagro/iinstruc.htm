      <p> 2. Ci&ecirc;ncia e Agrotecnologia is a scientific journal  edited once every two months by the Federal University of Lavras Publishing  House (Editora UFLA).  It publishes  scientific papers in the areas of Agricultural Science, Animal Science and  Veterinary, Food Science and Technology, Agrobusiness Economy and  Administration, Rural Engineering, elaborated by researchers of national and  international scientific communities. Submission of a manuscript to this  journal requires that it has neither been published nor is under consideration  for publication elsewhere. Upon acceptance for publication, authors assign to  the journal full copyright of the manuscript in all languages and countries.</p>
      <p> 3. <strong>Publication  process:</strong> Submitted manuscripts will be forwarded to the editorial board to  be initially evaluated in terms of comparative relevance to other papers of the  same area that were submitted for publication. If it is considered as relevant,  the paper will be submitted to blind peer reviewers. If approved and if  necessary, the manuscript may return to the correspondent author for  corrections. If the corrections are not returned within the required deadline,  the publication process will be automatically cancelled.  Requested corrections not attended without  justification may also lead to can- cellation. After these revisions, the  manuscript will receive corrections of scientific nomenclature, english,  references and portuguese (resumo). Following these corrections, the manuscript  will be edited and published.</p>
      <p> 4. <strong>Cost of  publication:</strong> The cost for publication is US$15.00 (fifteen dollars) per  edited page (printed page in the final format) up to six pages and US$30.00  (thirty dollars) for every additional page. <strong>A non-refundable</strong>, US$ 30.00 (thirty dollars) fee must be paid at  submission which will be discounted from the final edited manuscript cost  (final format).
