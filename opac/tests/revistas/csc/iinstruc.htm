      <p><i>Ci&ecirc;ncia &amp; Sa&uacute;de Coletiva</i> publishes debates, analyses  and research findings on specific themes considered to be of relevance to  public health, as well as articles for discussion and analysis of the state of  the art topics in the area and subareas, even if they are not directly related  to the core theme under scrutiny. The journal is published monthly and sets out  to tackle the challenges while seeking to consolidate and promote an ongoing  update of trends of thought and practices in public health in a dialogue with the  contemporary agenda of Science &amp; Technology.</p>
      <p><em>Open Access Policy - Ciência &amp; Saúde Coletiva is published under the Open Access model and is therefore free for anybody to read and download, and to copy and disseminate for educational purposes.</em></p>

      <p>Within the diversity of magazines  in the area, the hallmark of <i>Ci&ecirc;ncia &amp; Sa&uacute;de Coletiva</i> Journal is its  thematic focus in line with ABRASCO&rsquo;s vocation to conduct in-depth study, as  well as promote and disseminate academic debate and peer discussions on issues  considered important and relevant and highlight the historical development of public  health in Brazil.
      
      <p>The thematic editions are  scheduled around four modes of submission:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> By Term of Reference sent by teachers/researchers  in the area of public health (spontaneously or suggested by the Editors-in-Chief)  when they consider it relevant to examine a given subject in greater depth.</li>
        <li> By Term of Reference sent by coordinators of  unpublished and comprehensive research relevant to the area, on results  presented in the form of articles within the guidelines described above. In  these first two approaches, the Terms of Reference are evaluated on their  scientific merit and relevance by the Associate Editors of the Journal.</li>
        <li> By Public Call for papers announced in a page  in the journal, and coordinated by Guest Editors. In this case, the Guest  Editors accumulate the task of selecting the articles according to their scope  to be judged on their merit by referees.</li>
        <li> By Internal Organization of in-house Editors-in-chief,  bringing together unsolicited articles under a relevant title within the  criteria already described.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Term of Reference shall  contain: (1) title (even provisional) of the proposed thematic edition; (2) the  name (or names) of the Guest Editor(s); (3) justification summarized in one or  two paragraphs on the proposal from the point of view of the objectives, context,  meaning and relevance for Public Health; (4) a list of the ten proposed articles  already with the names of the invited authors; (5) the proposal with the text consisting  of an opinion or interview with someone who has authority in the discussion of the  subject; and (6) proposal of one or two synopses of books that address the theme.</p>
      <p>By editorial decision, the  maximum number of articles written by the same author in a thematic edition shall  not exceed three, either as first author or co-author.</p>
    <p>It is emphatically suggested to  the organizers that they submit contributions by authors from various national  institutions and from foreign contributors. As for any other form of  presentation, these editions accept texts in Spanish, English and French.</p></td>

      <p>It is recommended that articles  submitted shall not only address issues of local interest, or be restricted to  the descriptive plane. The discussions shall submit a broadened analysis that  situates the specificity of the research or review findings in the scenario of  the national and international literature on the subject, making clear the original  nature of the contribution that the article affords. </p>
      <p>Specifically in relation to qualitative articles, it must be noted in the text - explicitly - interpretations anchored in some theory or theoretical reflection inserted in the dialogue of Social and Human Sciences with Collective Health.</p>

      <p> 6. Picture files such as maps or photos should be saved in (or exported to) the JPEG, TIF or PDF formats.
