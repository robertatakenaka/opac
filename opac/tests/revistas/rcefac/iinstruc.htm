      <p>The CEFAC JOURNAL  - Speech, Language, Hearing Sciences and Education Journal (Rev. CEFAC.), ISSN 1982-0216, which is indexed in  the LILACS, SciELO, BVS, Sum&aacute;rios.org, Gale, Eletronic Journals Service -  Redalyc, ABEC databases, &nbsp;is published  every two months in order to register the scientific production on relevant  issues for the Speech Therapy in the following areas: Language, Orofacial  Motricity, Voice, Audiology, Collective Health, Dysphagia, SLP in schools, Speech Therapy and Related Areas. And also other  productions that address the SLP interface with the other educational and  health sciences. Only original full papers are  accepted for consideration, preferably written in English, but either Portuguese  or Spanish are acceptable; they must also not have been published previously, nor  be under review by another journal. If approved, the papers in  English must be accompanied by a certificate of a specialized company or a  translator that will be responsible for the English version. Initially, the submission may be sent in  the Portuguese version, but if the article is approved, the English version  becomes mandatory. The papers that can be forwarded are: original research  articles, review articles, brief communications, case reports and letter to  the editor.</p>
      <p> During the  selection of the articles for publication, the criteria will base on the  originality, relevance of the theme and the quality of the scientific  methodology applied, as well as compliance with the editorial norms adopted by  the Journal. Papers that neither meet the technical requirements nor comply  with the standards for publication will not be accepted for review and authors  will be duly informed, being able to forward the paper for consideration one  more time after the appropriate reformulations were made, receiving a new  number of submission.</p>
      <p> Every paper, after initial technical evaluation and  approval by the Editorial Board, will be forward for analysis and evaluation by  at least two referees (peer review) who are known for their subject-matter competency  and whose anonymity is guaranteed during the judging process.</p>
      <p> Comments will be compiled and sent to the authors so  that the suggested changes can be made or justified in case of their conservation.  After doing the corrections suggested by the reviewers, the definitive form of  the paper and the response letter commenting point by point the observations of  the evaluators<strong> must be forward again via online submission</strong>. Only after the final approval by the reviewers and  editors, the authors will be notified of the paper&rsquo;s acceptance and they will entry  the sequence for publication. Unselected papers will receive a refusal  notification.</p>
    <p>The editorial department of CEFAC Journal reserves  the right to make editorial changes when necessary without any change in its  content in order to standardize technical terms and presentation of the  manuscript. Only the CEFAC Journal can authorize the reproduction of the  articles contained therein in other journals. In these cases, the authors  should seek permission by writing to CEFAC Journal.</p></td>

      <p>The journal's guidelines are based on the format  proposed by the <em>International Committee of Medical Journal Editors</em> and  published in the article: <em>Uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to  biomedical journals</em>, version from February 2006 available at: <a href="http://www.icmje.org/"><strong>http://www.icmje.org/</strong></a> </p>
      <p>      CEFAC Journal supports the policies for registration  of clinical trials of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the <em>International Committee of Medical Journal  Editors</em> (ICMJE), recognizing the importance of these initiatives for the  registration and international dissemination of information on clinical trials  in open access. A clinical trial is any study that prospectively assigns human  beings to intervention or comparison groups to evaluate the cause and effect between  a medical intervention and a health outcome. Clinical trials must be registered  in one of the following records:</p>
      <p>  <em>Australian Clinical Trials Registry <strong>http://actr.org.au</strong></em><br>
        <em>Clinical Trials <strong>http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/</strong></em><br>

        <em>Nederlands Trial Register <strong>http://www.umin.ac.jp/ctr</strong></em><br>
        Authors are encouraged to consult the guidelines  relevant to their specific research design. For reports of randomized  controlled trials, authors can refer to the <em>CONSORT</em> recommendations at <a href="http://www.consort-statement.org/"><strong><em>http://www.consort-statement.org/</em></strong></a><strong></strong></p>

      <p><strong>7. Tables, Charts and Graphs (remember that charts and  graphs should be called Figures according to item 3) </strong><br>
        The tables, charts and graphs should be  formatted in Word or Excel, being fully editable and unlocked. No tables, charts  or graphs will be accepted if they are pasted into the text, or without the  original database in which it was created. In the case of formatted charts in  Excel, you are requested to send the original files (xls) in which they were  created. Each table must be sent on a separate page after the references. They  should be self-explanatory, dismissing queries to the text or other tables and  numbered consecutively with Arabic numerals in the order they are mentioned in  the text. They should present the title at the top, in capital letters, without  a period, aligned with the left edge of the table, after the indication of the  table number. Below each table, the same title alignment must present the  legend, statistical tests (test name and p value), and the source from which  the information was obtained (when they are not the author himself). The layout  should be simple in bold on the top, bottom, and the division lines between the  header and content. External vertical lines should not be drawn; as these  constitute charts and not tables.</p>
      <p><strong>8. </strong><strong>Figures  (photographs, illustrations): </strong>Images and illustrations should have their place indicated in the text  and also be sent in separate attachments in TIF or JPG format with a minimum  resolution of 300 dpi and&nbsp; it should be  considered the maximum width of the magazine which is 16.5 cm. They can be  colored or black and white (grayscale). They must be saved and named according  to the article and its order: artigoX_fig_1, artigoX_fig_2 successively and  identical to the content. Each figure must be sent on a separate page after the  references. They should be numbered consecutively in Arabic numerals in the  order they are mentioned in the text. Legends should be presented clearly and  described under the figures, out of the frame. When using statistical tests,  describe the test name, p-value, and the source from which the information was  obtained (when they are not the author himself). Graphics should preferably be  presented in the form of columns. For still images, indicate details with  arrows, letters, numbers and symbols, which should be clear and large enough to  hold reduction. They must be in JPG (Graphics Interchange Format) or TIF  (Tagged Image File Format) formats, high-resolution (minimum 300 dpi) so they  can be reproduced. Already published reproductions of Illustrations should be followed  by permission of the publisher and author.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>9. Statistical Analysis: </strong>The authors must show that the statistical  procedures employed were not only appropriate to test the hypotheses of the  study but also correctly interpreted. Levels of statistical significance (for  example: p &lt;0.05; p &lt;0.01; p &lt;0.001) should be mentioned.</p>
      <p><strong>10. Abbreviations and Acronyms: </strong>they<strong> </strong>must be preceded  by the their full name when mentioned for the first time. In the legends of  tables and figures, they should be followed by their full name. When present in  tables and figures, abbreviations and acronyms should be with their meanings in  subtitles. They should not be used in the title and abstract.</p>
      <p><strong>11. Units: </strong>values of physical quantities should be listed  following the International System of Units patterns, available at: <a href="http://www.inmetro.gov.br/infotec/publicacoes/Si/si.htm">http://www.inmetro.gov.br/infotec/publicacoes/Si/si.htm</a><em>. </em></p>
