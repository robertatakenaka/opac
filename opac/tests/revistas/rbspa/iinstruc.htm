      <p>The Brazilian Journal of Animal Health and Production has
  a group of notable experts in the subject areas. Original manuscripts are
  subject to approval of evaluators recognized experts in the topics covered.
  Items are shipped for review without identifying the author and venue of the
  experiments. The manuscripts are immediately forwarded to reviewers. The
  selection process involves review of 2 articles by specialists "ad
  hoc" in the field and members of the Editorial Board.</p>
      <p>The journal is divided into ten sections: agribusiness,
        pasture and forage crops, animal breeding and genetics, preventive and veterinary
        medicine, morphophysiology animal, animal nutrition, pathology and clinical,
        environmental and animal production, fisheries and aquaculture, and animal
        reproduction. Still, within sections, subsections fifty targeting production
        and animal health. (Articles from scientific research with merit and
        relevance to the area covered are encouraged; literature reviews may be
        considered provided there is merit and meets the scope of the Journal.) The
        original manuscripts are sent to expert in the field without the
        identification of authors and the institution where the experiment was
        conducted. Regarding the peer review process, the RBSPA editorial board is
        composed of a chief editor, scientific publishers (areas: animal health and
        production) and associate editors covering the sections of the Journal. The
        selection process involves review articles of at least two experts "ad
        hoc" beyond the editorial board. Manuscripts are subject to approval of
        evaluators recognized experts in the topics covered and are sent for review
        without identifying the author and venue of the experiments. Thus RBSPA has a
        group of notable experts in the subject areas.</p>
      <p>The RBSPA targets its publication on the scientific
        communities related to interested in agricultural sciences, animal husbandry,
        and veterinary medicine with a focus on animal health and production,
    especially those on Graduate Program and Research Institutions.</p>

      <p>The
periodic RBSPA is an electronic publication with free shipping and items
exclusively on the Internet (<a href="https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/rbspa-scielo" target="_blank">https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/rbspa-scielo</a>). Edited at the Federal
University of Bahia, is intended to publish review articles in English (at the
invitation of the Editorial Board) or original scientific research in the following
sections: Agribusiness; Forage and pasture; Preventive Veterinary Medicine,
Animal Breeding; Animal Morphophysiology, Animal Nutrition; and Clinical
Pathology, Animal Production and environment; Resources fisheries /
aquaculture, and Animal Reproduction.</p>
      <p>Articles
        submitted for publication are subject to the approval of the Editorial Board,
        with recommendation from experts in the field (peer reviewers). The opinions
        are impartial and &nbsp;Absolute secrecy on the part of authors and the reviewers,
        without identification among them. Manuscripts requiring revisions or
        corrections are returned to the authors and, if accepted for publication,
        become the RBSPA property. The concepts, information and conclusions contained
        in the papers are total responsibility of the authors.</p>
      <p>Manuscripts
        should be written in an impersonal form, double spaced (except in tables and
        figures), Times New Roman font size 12, white sheet in A4 format (21.0 x 29.7
        cm), with margins of three cm, pages sequentially numbered in Arabic numerals,
        not exceeding 20, including tables and figures (including review articles). The
        pages must have numbered lines (the numbering is done as follows: File menu /
        page setup / layout / numbers linha... / Numbered lines).</p>
      <p>Do not use
        abbreviations and acronyms, such as "T2 was lower than T4, and did not
        differ from T3 and T5." Such abbreviations make it difficult for readers to
        understand the text and its fluidity. Citations in the text: they are mentioned
        in order to clarify or supplement the author's ideas, illustrating and
        supporting statements. All documentation must be consulted cited due to
        copyright. The author citations in the text are in lowercase, followed by year
        of publication. When there are two authors, use &amp; (ampersand) and, in the
        case of three or more authors, cite only the surname first, followed by et al.
        (non-italic). It is mentioned that the date of publication cited in brackets
        should come soon after the author's name. The citations made at the end of the
        paragraph should be enclosed in parentheses and separated by semicolons, in
        chronological order. The article should not have references in publications
        arising from technical scientific events (proceedings of conferences, symposia,
        seminars and the like), as well as theses, dissertations and publications on
        the Internet (which are not part of scientific journals). You should then focus
        on articles published in journals with editorial (note percentage guidelines
        and timelines in the last paragraph of the section "References").</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Quote from
          quote (apud) Is not accepted</p>
        <p>Language:
        <ul><li>For submission:Portuguese, English or Spanish</li><li>For publication: English (after acceptance, all the manuscripts should be translated to English. The translation must be certified by a company.)</li></ul></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Table:
        should be mentioned in the text as Table and refers to the set of alphanumeric
        data arranged in rows and columns. Tables are built with only horizontal lines
        separating the header and the end of the table. The legend initially receives
        the word Table, followed by a serial number in Arabic numerals (eg Table 1.
        Gain average daily sheep fed lipid sources in the diet). The title of the table
        should be formatted so that, from the second line, the text starts below the
        first letter of the title and not the word Table. The end of the title must not
        contain dott. Frames are not accepted.</p>
      <p>Figure: it
        must be mentioned in the text as Figure (full) and refers to any incorporated
        or illustration that shows lines and dots: drawing, photography, graphic
        flowchart, diagram etc. The drawings, graphics and the like should be made
  &#8203;&#8203;with black ink, with high sharpness. The pictures in the size of
        10 &times; 15 cm, must be sharp with high contrast. Captions initially receive the
        word Figure followed by the serial number in Arabic numerals (eg Figure 1.
        Producing milk of Gir cows under thermal stress in 2005 and 2006). Size and
        proportion among numbers, letters and the entire figure should be paid careful
        attention to avoid unreadable statements and values, in case the figure needs
        to be dimensioned to fit in the text. The title of the figure should be
        formatted so that the second line from the text starts below the first letter
        of the title and not the word Figure. Also, at the end of the title must not
        contain dot. Both tables as figures must come as close as possible after their
        been mentioned in the text.</p>
