      <p><b>Peer  review</b></p>
      <p>All  materials published by Jornal de Pediatria undergo peer review. Each manuscript  is sent to the editors, who make sure that minimum standards and format  requirements are met. The manuscript is then sent to two expert reviewers who  are not members of the editorial staff. The reviewers are never from the same  institution as the authors. Based on the comments of these two reviewers, the  Editorial Board decides whether the manuscript should be published as is,  rejected or returned to the authors for amendment. A manuscript may be returned  to its authors several times for clarification and improvement and, at any  time, it can be rejected. Each revised version is always analyzed by the Board,  which makes the final decision.</p>
      <p><b>Types of  articles</b></p>
      <p>Jornal  de Pediatria accepts submissions of original articles, special articles, and  letters to the editor.</p>
      <p><b>Original  articles </b>include reports on controlled and randomized studies,  screening and diagnostic studies, and other descriptive and intervention  studies, as well as reports on basic research carried out with laboratory  animals. Manuscripts in this category should not exceed 3,000 words, 30  references and four tables and figures.</p>
      <p>Clinical  trials should be registered in one of the Clinical Trial Registries recommended  by the World Health Organization and the International Committee of Medical  Journal Editors. In the absence of a Latin American registry, Jornal de  Pediatria suggests the National Institutes of Health&rsquo;s registry, available at <a href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</a>.  The clinical trial identification number should appear at the end of the  abstract.</p>
      <p>Please access <a href="http://www.equator-network.org/">http://www.equator-network.org/</a> for further      information on how to publish this type of article.</p>
      <p><b>Special  articles </b>do not fall under any of the other categories. They are  considered to have special relevance and will be reviewed following special  criteria. Special articles are not limited in terms of length or number of  references.</p>
      <p><b>Letters  to the editor </b>usually express an opinion, discuss or criticize articles  previously published in Jornal de Pediatria. Letters should not exceed 1,000  words and six references. Whenever possible, a response from the authors of the  article to which the letter refers will be published along with the letter.</p>
      <p>Editorials,  comments and review articles are published under invitation. Authors of  unsolicited editorials, comments, and review articles must submit an outline to  the Editorial Board before submitting the manuscript.</p>
      <p><b>Editorials  and comments</b>, which usually make reference to selected articles,  are solicited from experts in the field. The Editorial Board may consider the  publication of unsolicited comments.</p>
      <p><b>Review  articles </b>are systematic, critical assessments of the literature concerning  topics of clinical relevance, with emphasis on aspects such as cause and  prevention of diseases, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Usually,  professionals of recognized expertise are invited to write review articles.  Meta-analyses are included in this category. Jornal de Pediatria will also  consider unsolicited review articles. For that, authors must submit an outline  to the Editorial Board before submitting the manuscript. Review articles should  not exceed 6,000 words, not including references and tables. A minimum of 30  up-to-date references should be cited.</p>
      <p><b>General  guidelines</b></p>
      <p>The file  - including tables, figures, and references - should be in accordance with the  "Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals,"  published by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (<a href="http://www.icmje/" target="_blank">http://www.icmje.org</a>). Each  section should start on a new page in the following order: title page,  abstract, main text, acknowledgements, references, tables (print or insert each  table, with title and footnotes, on a separate page), figures (print or insert  each graph, with title and footnotes, on a separate page), and figure legends.</p>
      <p>The main  recommendations for each section are as follows:</p>
      <p><b>Title  page. </b>The title page should contain all the following information:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>concise and informative title. Avoid unnecessary terms and abbreviations; also  avoid reference to the site and/or city where the work was carried out;</li>
        <li>short  title of not more than 50 characters including spaces to appear on the headers;</li>
        <li>authors&rsquo; names (first and last names and middle initials);</li>
        <li>e-mail address of all authors;</li>
        <li>if  available, URL to electronic curriculum vitae; Brazilian authors are advised to  inform the URL to "Curr&iacute;culo Lattes";</li>
        <li>the specific contribution of each author to the  study;</li>
        <li>statement of conflicts of interest (write "nothing to declare" or clearly  disclose any financial or other interests which could cause embarrassment if  revealed after the publication of the article);</li>
        <li>institution or service with which the work is associated for indexing in Index  Medicus/MEDLINE;</li>
        <li>name,  address, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail of corresponding author;</li>
        <li>name,  address, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail of author in charge of  pre-publication contacts;</li>
        <li>funding sources, or name of institutions or companies providing equipment and  materials, if applicable;</li>
        <li>word  count of the main text not including abstract, acknowledgements, references,  tables and legends to figures;</li>
        <li>abstract word count;</li>
        <li>number of tables and figures.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><b>Abstract</b></p>
      <p>The  abstract should have no more than 250 words or 1,400 characters, and  abbreviations should be avoided. Do not include words that could identify the  institution or city where the study was performed, to facilitate blind review.  All information in the abstract must accurately reflect the content of the  article. The abstract should be structured as described below:</p>
      <p><b>Abstract  for original articles</b></p>
      <p><b>Objective: </b>State why the study was initiated and any initial  hypotheses. Precisely define the main purpose of the study; only the most  relevant secondary objectives should be listed.</p>
      <p><b>Method: </b>Describe  the study design (if appropriate, state whether the study is randomized,  blinded, prospective, etc.), setting (if appropriate, describe the level of  care, i.e., primary, secondary or tertiary, private clinic or public  institution, etc.), patients or participants (selection criteria, number of cases  at the beginning and at the end of the study, etc.), interventions (include  essential information, such as methods and duration of the study), and criteria  used to measure the outcomes.</p>
      <p><b>Results: </b>Describe the most important findings, confidence intervals, and  statistical significance of the findings.</p>
      <p><b>Conclusions:</b> Only describe  conclusions that reflect the purpose of the study and that are supported by  your findings. Discuss possible applications of the findings, with equal  emphasis on positive and negative findings that have similar scientific merit.</p>
      <p><b>Abstract  for review articles</b></p>
      <p><b>Objective: </b>Explain why the review was performed, stating whether it  focuses on a special factor, such as disease etiology, prevention, diagnosis,  treatment or prognosis.</p>
      <p><b>Sources: </b>Describe all sources of information, defining databases and  years researched. Briefly state the criteria used to select articles for review  and to assess the quality of information.</p>
      <p><b>Summary  of the findings: </b>State the main quantitative or qualitative findings.</p>
      <p><b>Conclusions: </b>State your conclusions and their clinical application, keeping  generalizations within the scope of the subject under review.</p>
      <p>Below  the abstract, include three to six keywords that will be useful for indexing  purposes. Please use Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), available at <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/" target="_blank">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html</a>.  Whenever adequate descriptors are not available you may use new terms.</p>
      <p>Abbreviations  should be avoided and are not accepted in titles or in the abstract. If used,  abbreviations should be defined the first time they appear in the text.</p>
      <p><b>Text</b></p>
      <p>The main  text in original articles should contain the following sections, indicated by a  subtitle:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Introduction: </b>Make it brief, including only references that are  strictly relevant to underscore the importance of the topic and to justify the  study. At the end of the introduction, research objectives must be clearly  stated.</li>
        <li><b>Methods: </b>This section should describe the study population, the  sample being analyzed, and the selection criteria; it should also clearly  define the variables under study, and describe in detail the statistical  methods employed (including appropriate references  about statistical methods and software). Procedures, products, and equipment  should be described in sufficient detail so as to allow reproduction of the  study. A statement concerning approval by the research ethics committee (or equivalent)  of the institution in which the work was carried out must be included.</li>
        <li><b>Results: </b>Study results should be presented in a clear, objective manner,  following a logical sequence. Information contained in tables or figures should  not be repeated in the text. Use figures rather than tables to present  extensive data.</li>
        <li><b>Discussion: </b>Results should be interpreted and compared with previously published  data, emphasizing new and important aspects of the present study. Discuss the  implications of the findings and the limitations of the study, as well as the need for  additional research. Conclusions should be presented at the end of the  Discussion section, taking into consideration the purpose of the work. Relate  the conclusions to the initial study objectives, avoiding statements that are  not supported by the  findings and giving similar emphasis to positive and negative findings that  have similar scientific relevance. If relevant, include recommendations for  further research.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The  sections in <b>review articles </b>may vary depending on the topic. We suggest  that authors include a brief introduction, in which they explain (from the  perspective of the medical literature) the importance of the review for the  practice of pediatrics. It is not necessary to describe how data were selected and  collected. The conclusions section should correlate the main ideas in the  review to possible clinical applications, keeping  generalizations within the scope of the subject under review.</p>
      <p><b>Acknowledgements</b></p>
      <p>Acknowledgements  should be brief and objective; only individuals or institutions that  contributed significantly to the study, but are not qualified for authorship,  should be mentioned. Individuals cited in this section must agree in writing to  the inclusion of their names, since readers may infer their endorsement of the  conclusions of the study.</p>
      <p><b>References</b></p>
      <p>References  should follow the Vancouver style, also known as the Uniform Requirements  style, which is based largely on an American National Standards Institute style  adapted by the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) for its databases.  Authors should consult Citing Medicine, The NLM Style Guide for Authors, Editors,  and Publishers (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=citmed" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=citmed</a>) for  information on the recommended formats for a variety of reference types.  Authors may also consult sample references (<a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/" target="_blank">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html</a>),  a list of examples extracted from or based on Citing Medicine for easy general  use; these sample references are maintained by NLM.</p>
      <p>References  must be numbered consecutively in the order in which they appear in the text,  identified by superscript numbers. Do not use automatic numbering, footnotes or  end notes for references.</p>
      <p>Unpublished  articles that have been accepted for publication may be included as references  if the name of the journal is included followed by "in press."</p>
      <p>Unpublished  observations and personal communications should not be cited as references; if  this information is essential for the understanding of the article, it may be  cited within the text, followed by the observations in parentheses "unpublished  observation" or "personal communication." Titles of journals should be  abbreviated according to the Index Medicus; for a comprehensive list of journal  title abbreviations, see the List of Serials Indexed for Online Users,  available at <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/serials/lsiou.html" target="_blank">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/serials/lsiou.html</a>.

      </blockquote>
      <p><b>Tables</b></p>
      <p>Each  table should be typed on a separate sheet of paper, numbered consecutively in  the order in which it appears in the text. Tables should have a brief but  comprehensive title. All explanatory notes should be presented as footnotes  indicated by superscript lowercase letters assigned in alphabetical order. <br>
        Do not  underline or separate lines with borders. Do not use the space bar to create  columns. Do not leave a space before or after the symbol &#177;.</p>
      <p><b>Figures  (photographs, drawings, graphs, etc.)</b></p>
      <p>All  figures should be numbered consecutively in the order in which they have been  first cited in the text. All explanatory notes should be included in the figure  legend. Reproduction of previously published figures should be indicated in the  legend, and must be accompanied on submission by a permission letter from the  copyright holder. Photographs should not allow identification of patients;  please note that masking the eye region may not be sufficient to protect the  patient&rsquo;s anonymity. If any photographs allow a patient to be identified, a  written permission to use the photograph must be provided. Photomicrographs should  present internal scales and arrows that contrast with the background.</p>
      <p>Jornal  de Pediatria publishes color illustrations online. However, all figures will be  converted into black &amp; white format for publication in print. If the  authors consider that color is essential, they should contact the editors.  Computer-generated images, such as graphs, should be attached as .jpg, .gif, or  .tif files, with a resolution of at least 300 dpi, to enable good-quality reproduction.  This resolution will be adjusted to 72 dpi for online publication. Do not  submit three-dimensional graphs. If the resolution of scanned drawings,  photographs, or illustrations is not adequate for printing, submit your  manuscript via regular mail with two copies of the original illustrations  (professionally drawn or printed with a resolution of 300 dpi or higher). In  this case, affix a label to the back of the figure, indicating figure number,  first author&rsquo;s name, and top of the figure (with an arrow).</p>
      <p><b>Figure  legends</b></p>
      <p>Legends  should be included on a separate page, identified by figure number.</p>
      <p><b>Checklist</b></p>
      <p>As part  of the submission process, authors are required to check off their submission&rsquo;s  compliance with all of the following items, and submissions may be returned to  authors that do not adhere to these guidelines.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>All  authors fully agree with the Copyright Notice.</li>
        <li>The  submission file is saved as a Microsoft Word document.</li>
        <li>The  title page contains all required information, as specified in the Author  Guidelines.</li>
        <li>An  abstract with keywords in the language of submission (English or Portuguese) is  provided, following the title page.</li>
        <li>The  text is double-spaced throughout, uses a 12-point font, and uses italics rather  than underlining for emphasis (except with URL addresses). All tables, figures,  and figure legends are numbered in the order in which they appear in the text,  and they are placed each on a separate page, after the references, at the end  of the file.</li>
        <li>The  text adheres to the stylistic and bibliographic requirements outlined in the  Author Guidelines. <br>
          7.  References are presented in the so-called Vancouver style and numbered  consecutively in the order in which they appear in the text.</li>
        <li>Information concerning approval of the study by a research ethics committee is  clearly stated within the main text, in the methods section.</li>
