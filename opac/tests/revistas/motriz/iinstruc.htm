      <p>Use of DOI is highly encouraged.</p>
      <p>          <strong>Proofs</strong></p>
      <p>All manuscripts will undergo some editorial  modification, so it is important to check proofs carefully.The corresponding  author will be sent an email asking them to check their proofs. The email will  either have a link for authors to access their PDF proofs online, or will have  a PDF proof attached.<br>
        To avoid delays in publication, proofs should be checked and returned within 2  working days. The preferred method of correction is by annotated PDF. Extensive  changes to the text may be charged to the author.</p>
      <p><strong>Copyrights</strong>&nbsp;<strong><br>
        </strong>Copyrights  of published articles are the property of Motriz, and under no circumstance  will the Journal transfer rights of published work. Reproduction of portions of  published articles in other publications, or for any other use, is subject to  written permission by the Editors-in-Chief.&nbsp;Upon acceptance of an article,  authors will be asked to complete a "Journal Publishing Agreement." Acceptance  of the agreement will ensure the widest possible dissemination of information.  An email will be sent to the corresponding author confirming receipt of the manuscript  together with a "Journal Publishing Agreement" form or a link to the online  version of this agreement.</p>
      <p><strong>Guiding Principles for Research Involving  Animals and Human Beings</strong></p>
      <p><em>Animal  research:</em></p>
      <p>Research involving animals must adhere to  Guiding Principles in the Care and Use of Animals in Research in agreement with  the Brazilian Council for using animal in research (CONCEA/BR) and a statement  of protocol approval from a Local Committee must be included in the Methods  section of the manuscript. Studies involving surgeries or other painful  procedures must include an explanation of steps taken to mitigate pain and  distress, including the types and dosage of anesthetics and post-operative  analgesics that were used.</p>
      <p><em>Human  Studies</em></p>
      <p>Protocols involving human subject (healthy or  not) must be reviewed and approved by a research Ethics Committee prior to  starting the study, and participants must provide written informed consent as  stated by Brazilian Council of Ethics in research with human subject  (CONEP/BR). These two statements must be affirmed in the Methods section of the  manuscript.</p>
      <p>All the procedures should be conducted according  to high standards of safety and ethics. We reserve the right to refuse the  manuscript, if the authors fail to provide ethical information during  submission process.</p>
      <p> To ensure these requirements, it is essential that submission  documentation is complete with the three required documents: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Approval of Institutional Ethics Committee:<br>
        <a href="http://ib.rc.unesp.br/Home/Departamentos47/EducacaoFisica/guiding-principles-for-research-involving-animals-and-human-beings.pdf" target="_blank">http://ib.rc.unesp.br/Home/Departamentos47/EducacaoFisica/guiding-principles-for-research-involving-animals-and-human-beings.pdf</a>      </li>
      <li>Declaration of conflict of interest:<br>

      <li>Journal Publishing Agreement signed by the corresponding author on  behalf of co-authors:<br>
        <a href="http://ib.rc.unesp.br/Home/Departamentos47/EducacaoFisica/authors-agreement.docx" target="_blank">http://ib.rc.unesp.br/Home/Departamentos47/EducacaoFisica/authors-agreement.docx</a>      </li>
  </ol>
    <p>These supplementary files must be attached in the Motriz  electronic system.</p>
    <p>Motriz reserves all rights of its published articles.  Therefore, any duplication of information conveyed in the journal or previously  published in another publication--from materials published by the authors  themselves or from authorship of others--is considered copyright infringement.  This is a very serious breach of ethics, and, in such cases, disciplinary  measures will be taken (e.g., retraction of the article; suspension of the  implicated authors and co-authors for a minimum period of five years, or upon  discretion of the editorial board).</p>
    <p>  <strong>Peer review process</strong><br>
      An original manuscript submitted for publication will be submitted to the  review process as long as it fits the following criteria:<br>
      √ the study was not previously published, nor has been submitted simultaneously  for consideration of publication elsewhere;&nbsp;<br>
      √ all persons listed as authors approved its submission to Motriz;&nbsp;<br>
      √ any person cited as a source of personal communication has approved the  quote;<br>
      √ the opinions expressed by the authors are their exclusive responsibility;<br>
      √ the author signs a formal statement that the submitted manuscript complies  with the directions and guidelines of Motriz.</p>
    <p>The Editor-in-Chief and Associate Editors will make a  preliminary analysis regarding the appropriateness, quality, originality and  written style/grammar of the submitted manuscript. The editors reserve the  right to request additional information, corrections, and guideline compliance  before they submit the manuscript to the "ad-hoc" review process.</p>
    <p> Minor changes in the text may be made at the discretion of the Editors-in-Chief  and/or Associate Editors.&nbsp; Changes can include spelling and grammar in the  chosen language, written style, journal citations, and reference guidelines.  The author is notified of changes at any point of the review process, or during  the paper production for publication. The final version is available to the  author for his or her approval before it is published.</p>
    <p> Motriz uses "ad-hoc" reviewers, who volunteer to analyze the merit of the  study. Typically, one or more expert reviewers are consulted in a single-blind  process. Authors are notified by e-mail when their submission has been accepted  (or rejected).<br>
      Important: The Motriz Editorial Board believes that majority of research  authors who submit manuscripts to this journal expects positive and high  quality reviews of their peers. In addition, this board expects that all  authors who consider submitting a manuscript, have already submitted, or have a  paper recently published in Motriz must act, upon invitation, as "ad hoc"  reviewer of manuscripts submitted to this journal.</p>
    <p> Published manuscripts are entirely the responsibility of the  authors and do not reflect opinions or personal views of Motriz Journal editors  or associate editors.</p>

      <li><em>Videos Research: Videos demonstrating cutting edge of       Exercise Sciences and scientific results as well as clinical cases are       very welcome to Motriz Journal. The video research has to be high-quality       demonstrations of procedure in Exercise Sciences allowing easy       comprehension of the information.        Additional concise manuscripts to each video detail the procedures       and the findings in a bullet point style are accepted.  The length of the video should be 3-5       min. Human or animal studies must comply with official ethics committee       standards. </em></li>
      <li><em>Protocol design and ideas research exchange:<strong> </strong>This session aims to publish protocols design  from leading experts in exercise/training field. The main goal is to share the  best methods to answer questions in Exercise Science either in human studies or  experimental models. The authors should give full information of the design  protocol addressing advantages and limitations of the methods. The  merit/originality of the article will be externally peer-reviewed. The main  audience of this session is young researchers and beginners in Exercise  Science, thus only protocols that have research applications will be published</em>.</li>
