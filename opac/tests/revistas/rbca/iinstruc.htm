      <p>The  publication of the Brazilian Journal of Poultry Science is coordinated by the  Publishing Committee of FACTA (APINCO Foundation of Poultry Science and  Technology). All published research data and conclusions are of authors&rsquo; full  responsibility.</p>
      <p>The  Brazilian Journal of Poultry Science is published quarterly and the journal will  consider for publication only original research material relevant to the field  of poultry science. Considered subject areas will include: Immunology,  Biochemistry and Cellular Biology, Housing and Environment, Wasting Control,  Avian Diseases, Nutrition, Genetic Improvement, Physiology and Breeding,  Management, Egg Production, Meat Technology, and Wild and Exotic Birds and  Quail Production.</p>
      <p>The journal&acute;s main objective is to publish complete  scientific and technical papers as well as literature reviews in the area of poultry  science written by researchers and poultry science specialists. Authors wishing  to submit a review, guest editorial or technical review should contact the journal&acute;s  editor.</p>
      <p>All submitted manuscripts are&nbsp;evaluated in  a&nbsp;blind peer-review, and in a total  confidential and impartial way. Manuscripts should be submitted in the <strong>English language only</strong>.</p>

      <p><strong>Full length article</strong></p>
      <p>It should contain the results of original research which  contributes in a relevant way to the development of poultry science. If part of  the results has been published previously as a summary or short paper in scientific  events, it must be stated. Priority will be given to manuscript presenting new  concepts, methodologies or innovative experimental approaches. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>The manuscript should have the following sections:</p>
      <p>Title<br>
        Abstract<br>
        Introduction<br>

      <p>The sections Results and Discussion can be presented  jointly if preferred. The Abstract should contain up to 250 (two hundred and  fifty) words, followed by the key words in alphabetic order, limited to 5  (five) words which correspond to words or expressions that identify the contents  of the article.</p>
      <p>Short communications and Case Reports should have the  same layout as full length papers, including the headings (Introduction,  Abstract, Material and Methods,<br>
        Result, Discussion, Acknowledgments and References). They  should be presented in a text with up to 1000 words (plus Abstract and References)  and should contain no more than three tables and/or figures.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Technical article</strong><br>
        Technical articles should present the development of  new methodologies and/or techniques that can be applied to improve poultry  production. These should follow the editorial norms including all sections of  the scientific article.</p>
      <p><strong>Guest Editorial and Invited Review</strong><br>
      Both Guest Editorial and Invited Review will be  published by invitation only. The review should follow the norms of the  scientific article without the sub-items of Material and Methods, Results and  Discussion and preserving all others present in a full length manuscript.</p>
