<td width="70%"><p><em>cadernos pagu</em> is a triennial interdisciplinary journal  that publishes original articles with original scientific contributions. It  also presents debates about relevant theoretical texts in the field of gender  studies, based on a selection and indication from the Editorial Committee. <em>cadernos pagu</em> also offers thematic  dossiers, which are articulated and heterogeneous groups of articles that provide  critical reflection about the issue in focus, with different and divergent  theoretical and conceptual sources and research methodologies.</p>
  <p> It is  particularly desirable that the articles sent to the journal have a social and  political scope, that is, that they do not treat an issue in isolation from the  social context and political relations, so that specific analyses have ties  with broader issues. It is recommended that collaborators cite authors from  beyond the Anglo-Saxon universe who are commonly used as references for gender  studies, thus broadening the range of theoretical references.</p>
  <p> The  articles submitted to <em>cadernos pagu</em> must be never have been previously published<strong>. </strong>&nbsp;No articles will be  accepted that are being evaluated by other periodicals.</p>
  <p> The  content of the signed papers is the exclusive responsibility of the author or  authors, as well&nbsp; as the selection of  keywords.</p>
  <p><em>cadernos pagu</em> has published contributions from the  fields of anthropology, sociology, history, political sciences, language and  literature, linguistics the history of science and education and has recently  expanded to the fields of law, psychology, communication, collective health and  social work.</p>
  <p>      <em>cadernos pagu</em> stimulates the publication of  articles from different disciplinary fields, as long as they engage in a  discussion with gender and feminist theories, seeking articulations between  gender and other differences (such as race and ethnicity, culture, class, age  and generation, sexuality and others).</p>
  <p> Contributions  are welcome in Portuguese, Spanish or English.</p>
  <p><strong>TRANSLATION POLICY</strong>: &nbsp;The articles can be submitted in Portuguese,  Spanish or English. Contributions in Portuguese and Spanish will be published  in the language of origin, and can be translated to English, at the author&rsquo;s  cost, by translators indicated by the journal. Contributions received in  English must be translated into Portuguese, at the author&rsquo;s cost, by  translators indicated by the journal; and will be published in the two  languages.</p>
  <p>  <strong>EVALUATION CRITERIA: </strong>The criteria used for evaluation  include: clear, objective and formally correct writing; inclusion of a classic  and recent bibliography, which contemplates currently existing debates in the  field of gender studies about the issue addressed; the presentation of a  relevant theme and empirical or theoretical contribution or methodological  innovation in relation to the state of the art of the field of gender studies; and  the use of consistent arguments, theoretical-methodological coherence and  evidence to support the arguments.</p>
  <p><strong>FORM OF EVALUATION: </strong>The publication of articles is  determined by reviews by members of the journal&rsquo;s editorial bodies including:&nbsp; the editor and executive editor, the Editorial  Committee (which includes the journal editors, and recognized researchers, who  meet periodically to make decisions, thus actively contributing to editorial  administration and the flow of evaluations); the Editorial Board (constituted  by leading researchers in their fields in Brazil and abroad, whose function is  to assist the editors and the editorial committee) and the Advisory Board  (formed by Brazilian and foreign ad hoc evaluators who have recognized  expertise, and which is responsible for supporting the editors in making  decisions about the articles submitted, thus contributing to the quality and scientific  control of the journal).</p>
  <p> The  articles received pass through three evaluation filters. The first filtering,  conducted by the editors, is of a strictly formal character and evaluates if  the text is in keeping with the editorial norms and those for presentation. The  second filter, conducted by the editor, supported by the Editorial Committee  and Editorial Board, decides if the article is suitable or not to the scope of <em>cadernos pagu</em>. If the determination is  negative, a letter is drafted explaining the reasons for the rejection. If the decision  is positive, names of ad hoc evaluators are indicated, who have a Ph.D. and recognized  expertise in the field. Finally, the third filter is conducted by the Advisory  Board which, based on double-blind evaluations, assists the editors in making  the final decision, which is communicated by letter to the author.</p>
  <p> The  letter of determination sent by the editor may: i) accept the article for  publication, with or without changes; ii) suggest that substantive revisions be  made before it is presented once again for evaluation; or iii) suggest that it  be sent to another journal; iv) deny publication.</p>
  <p><strong>DEADLINES FOR EVALUATION: </strong>The journal receives an increasing  number of contributions and has made an effort to reduce the time needed to  evaluate articles. Since 2016, our goal is that the approximate time for a  final decision is 3 months in the case of articles that are rejected in the first  or second filter and 6 months in the case of articles sent to the ad hoc  evaluators. This average time is calculated from the date of submission until  that of the final decision concerning publication. Authors can accompany the  situation of the article at any time on the Scielo submission platform.</p>
  <p> The approved  articles will be sent for layout and proofreading and returned to the author to  receive consent for any suggested changes. After the author&rsquo;s approval, no other  additions or modifications will be permitted, except in exceptional cases.</p>
  <p> There  is no fee for submission and evaluation of the articles. The translation of  articles is optional and must be paid for by the authors. </p>
  <p><strong>DOSSIERS</strong> - <em>cadernos pagu</em> is open to proposals for thematic dossiers about  gender, sexuality and feminisms sent by scholars from all disciplines. The  dossiers should include Brazilian and foreign sources, and have at lest 30% foreign  authors and include contributions from various institutions and research groups  from at least three Brazilian states, preferentially those beyond Rio de  Janeiro and S&atilde;o Paulo. Regional diversity and internationalization are criteria  for selection of the dossiers. The Editorial Committee understands that a  dossier is not a simple profile of an established or emerging research field,  but an articulated and heterogeneous group of articles that offers critical  reflection about the issue in focus and its different and diverging  theoretical, conceptual and methodological sources. Proposals for dossiers  should be sent directly to <a href="mailto:cadpagu@unicamp.br">cadpagu@unicamp.br</a>. It should include a <strong>summary </strong>of up to 700 words with a  justification about the historic and current relevance of the theme to feminist  and gender studies articulated to other differences; the divergences or  tensions contemplated and the contributions to the expansion, improvement and or  deepening of the theme. A <strong>list of the authors </strong>should indicate their institutional affiliation, abbreviated resumes and  200-250 word abstracts for each article. Translations of classic articles or  those that are reference works for a theme that have previously been published  will only be included in a debate format. That is, there must be a presentation  of the article&rsquo;s contribution to the current state of the debate made by the  organizers or another author, as well as current authorization for publication.</p>
  <p> The  proposals for a dossier are evaluated by the Editorial Committee with the  support of the Editorial Board. Once approved, their articles must be  submitted, individually, by the authors on the Scielo submission platform and will  be evaluated by the ad hoc reviewers indicated by the editors and the Editorial  Committee. The group of articles must be submitted for evaluation at least six  months before the date planned for publication.</p>
  <p>It  is desirable that the complete dossier be published in a bilingual edition &ndash; Portuguese  or Spanish and English - according to the journal&rsquo;s translation policy.</p>
