    <p><b>Chronicle:</b> Social Service is a profession regulated by law
    and an area of scientific knowledge that has been developing in Brazil for more than seventy years. In our country there are more than 85 thousand social
    workers graduated and registered in their Regional Committees of
    Professional Inspection. In relation to the number of professionals, in Brazil we have the second biggest set of social workers in the world, the USA having the
    first one.</p>
    <p>According to Yazbek, Martinelli and Raichelis
    (2008), "the critical production about the profession is concentrated in Brazil, and it has to be considered that all the doctoral courses are in Brazilian
    universities, being such courses responsible for the qualification of the
    first masters and doctors in the area in Latin American and  European
    countries".</p>
    <p>In the past three decades, the area has presented
    a great development in its academic production, and such production,
    besides having contributed to develop new and improved professional interventions
    in the several fields of the social policies, has achieved the writing of
    hundreds of books, articles, reviews, and communication of researches. </p>
    <p>Thus, the Brazilian Social Service was enriched
    when it changed from a discipline almost entirely devoted to <i>intervention</i>
    to a vigorous area of production of knowledge of the social reality, which
    decisively contributed to the creation of postgraduation courses that gave
    a new influx to the research and the production of bibliography of the
    area.</p>
    <p>Since its creation, in September 1979, the
    journal <i>Servi&ccedil;o Social &amp; Sociedade</i> has had an editorial politics
    directed to giving voice to the valuable academic and professional
    production of social workers and related professionals, as well as it has
    also shown the socialpolitical development of the Social Service and the
    thinking of its representative bodies.</p>
    <p>The periodical was created at the end of the
    military government, when several social and popular movements were
    questioning the authoritarian State and were demanding democratic
    liberties. This was the same period when there was large unions'
    mobilization leading to the big strikes at ABC and to the creation of
    Partido dos Trabalhadores and CUT.</p>
    <p>Those were the circumstances that marked the
    process of rearticulation of the politicalprofessional forces in the
    Brazilian society and in the Social Services, which promoted
    diversification and democratization in the ways social workers expressed
    themselves and researched. In this sense, the creation of the journal <i>Servi&ccedil;o
    Social &amp;</i> <i>Sociedade</i> was contemporary with the significant
    renewal of the Social Service, and it keeps on contributing to the academic
    and professional development of this area of knowledge and intervention in
    the reality, as well as the development of related areas.</p>
    <p>It is the first journal of Social Services to
    have a national circulation, and it is one of the most important
    periodicals of reference for professors and university students,
    researchers and professionals who try to keep up with the debate about the
    important national and international issues that reflect on the Social
    Services and the Social and Human Sciences.</p>
    <p>According to researcher Maria Ozanira da Silva e
    Silva, "it is the only Latin American periodical that has got to number 100
    with a regular flow of publication for thirty years". The same researcher
    emphasizes the "recent classification in the A1 Stratum in the Capes / MEC's Qualis System Periodicals" (SILVA E SILVA, 2009, p. 601).</p>
    <p><b>Aims:</b> To make the academic and professional production
    by social workers and related researchers known, as well as contributing to
    the debate and critical and analytical deepening of the social theory, with
    emphasis on themes related to the Brazilian and Latin American reality. </p>
    <p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
    <p><b>Areas of interest:</b> Applied Social Sciences, Human Sciences, Social
    Services, Ethics, Political Science, Public Policies, Health.</p>
    <p><b>Additional information:</b> The graphic and editorial project of
    the journal has been reformulated every 50 issues since its creation in
    order to modernize and improve its visual quality, so that the journal
    becomes more and more attractive and easier to handle. The last
    reformulation happened in number 100, September / December 2009. Besides
    that, in the special issues published to mark each decade of existence, <i>Servi&ccedil;o</i>
    <i>Social &amp; Sociedade</i> has invited researchers and professionals to
    debate a theme of interest to the area, and that debate is ultimately
    revised and edited to be published in its pages, which has been very well
    received by the public of the journal. In Issue 100 there was an even
    further innovation, because two DVDs with the whole reproduction of the
    debate promoted by the journal to celebrate its thirty years of existence
    were added to the issue.   </p>

<p><b>GUIDELINES TO THE AUTHORS</b></p>

<p><b>Aims and policy</b></p>



<p>The quality of the articles is guaranteed by the journal's editorial
staff, made up of distinguished professors and professionals coming from
different Brazilian and foreign universities.</p>



<p>The journal is made up of articles selected out of those ones received
by the publishing house, as well as of articles specifically written by
researchers and professionals largely known by their expertise. Besides the
articles (each issue has about nine articles), <i>Servi&ccedil;o</i> <i>Social &amp;
Sociedade</i> publishes texts that interest both social workers and related
professionals. Such texts are distributed in the following moving sections:
Open channel, Communication about researches, Testimonies, Interviews,
Expressions of social thinking, Homage, Inform yourself, Debates, Registers,
Reportings of experiences, Reviews, Themes to discuss and Explaining clearly.</p>



<p>From issue 67 (September, 2001) on, the journal has published special
thematic issues presenting  the readers with thoughts and debates about
specific themes related not only to Social Services, but also to aging,
families, sociallegal topics, children and adolescents etc. Specific
committees are formed to organize such special issues, and experts and invited
researchers take part in those specific committees. </p>



<p>The journal has also been working to present questions affecting several
countries of the world, and it has enlarged its thematic comprehension beyond Latin America. It has been keeping a dialogue with the Portuguese Social Services as a way
to enter Europe and African countries.</p>



<p>Every person who is interested in social policies or is directly
involved with research, formulation, or operation of social policies in general
can find in <i>Servi&ccedil;o Social &amp; Sociedade</i> an important datum resource,
as well as a repository of the best and more advanced researches on the themes.</p>



<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>Target readers</b>: professors, researchers, students and professionals
from Social Services and related areas</p>



<p><b>Form and preparation of the manuscripts</b></p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>The journal has an open structure, so as to make it possible to present
articles from monographs, endofgraduationcourse papers, projects, reportings
of professional experiences etc., as well as interviews, reviews, reproduction
of debates, testimonies in general, notes, communications, and significant
registers. All pieces of writing are submitted to the Editorial Board, which
takes the final decision about what to publish. </p>



<p>The articles sent to the journal pass through the following register
procedure: evaluation and approval of the originals. The text that comes only
by mail is dated at the Editorial Office and gets a number of order. These
originals are directed to be analysed by the Editorial Board bimonthly. The
Staff selects an Editorial Committee for each issue of the journal, and that
committee puts forward the proposal of the articles of that issue. Such a
proposal is analyzed at the Editorial Staff's general meeting that happens
every two months. The Enlarged Editorial Board receives the originals to
analyze accordingly, following the Editorial Committee's decision. Each article
to be analyzed by the Committee has an evaluation card in which there are
observations and / or suggestions to make the article adequate to the norms of
publication. In that card it is also recorded a technical opinion indicating
why its publication is recommended or refused. The journal compromises to
always give an answer by email to the authors, whether this answer is positive
or negative. If the article is refused, the reasons why that happened are not
given.</p>



<p>It is required that (1) the title of the article is translated into
English; (2) there is an abstract of the article, and it has to be up to seven
lines long; (3) from  three to six keywords are presented. Besides, the
abstract and the keywords must be translated into English too.</p>



<p>The articles should be written preferably in Times or Arial 12, and with
a 1.5 space between lines. If there are footnotes, they should be written in
Times or Arial 10.</p>



<p>Texts in Spanish are accepted. </p>



<p>The bibliography has to be placed at the end of the article, and it must
be in alphabetical order. Only the texts that were referred to along the text
should be cited. The norms of Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Brasileira de Normas T&eacute;cnicas  ABNT 
are to be followed. The titles of the periodicals have to be written out in
full. The authors of the articles should check if the references cited in the
text are in the bibliography, with exact publishing dates and spelling of the
authors'names. The list of references must follow the style of the examples
below:</p>

<p><i>Illustrations</i></p>

<p>The illustrations (graphics, photos, drawings etc.) have to be numbered
in sequence, with Arabic numerals, and they have to be cited as Figures. They
must be clear enough (high resolution) so that they can be printed. The
approximate place where the illustrations should be put must be indicated. Both
the illustrations and the tables have to be prepared in a graphics processor
program.</p>



<p>The articles sent to the journal must be unpublished, and the Editorial
Board is responsible for evaluating exceptions. The copyright of the published
articles belongs to the authors, and the copyright of each edition belongs to
Cortez Editora. Therefore, if the authors of the articles want to publish them
again in anthologies or other periodicals, they are simply asked to mention the
first publication in <i>Revista Servi&ccedil;o Social &amp; Sociedade</i>.</p>



<p>The Editorial Board and the editorship of the journal have the right to
refuse the text that was received and / or to suggest the author changes of
form, so as to make the article adequate to the patterns of the journal.</p>



<p>The titles of the articles should be as short as possible.</p>



<p>The originals sent to the journal will be presented in the definitive
version. Those ones that were not approved will be at the author's disposal for
one (1) month, from the date of the email informing that the article was
refused. After such a period, if the author does not ask for the article,
Cortez Editora compromises to destroy the text.</p>



<p>The pure and simple sending of the originals to the journal implies
authorization to publish them.</p>



<p>Answers and comments about the published articles are of interest to the
journal, and if they are accepted to be published, they will be sent to the
authors before their publication, so that the authors can do the rejoinder,
preferably in the same issue. </p>



<p>The authors whose articles are published have a right to have five (5)
copies of the journal, in case of an only author per article. If there are two
authors for the article, they have a right to three (3) copies each. If there
are three or more authors for the article, each one of them will receive two
copies as copyright.</p>



<p>Articles that attempt at the professional ethics, with prejudiced terms
or ideas, or that present points of view incompatible with the philosophy of
work of the Editorial Board and Cortez Editora will not be published. </p>



<p>The authors are responsible for the concepts and information in the articles
that are published in <i>Revista Servi&ccedil;o Social &amp;</i> <i>Sociedade</i>.
Such concepts and information are not necessarily those of the Editorial Board
or Cortez Editora.</p>



<p>The articles must be sent directly to Cortez Editora (and never to any
member of the Editorial Staff or Team of Collaborators), specifically to
