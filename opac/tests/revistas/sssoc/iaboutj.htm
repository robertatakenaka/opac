      <p><b>Chronicle:</b> Social Service is a profession regulated by law and 
        an area of scientific knowledge that has been developing in Brazil for 
        more than seventy years. In our country there are more than 85 thousand 
        social workers graduated and registered in their Regional Committees of 
        Professional Inspection. In relation to the number of professionals, in 
        Brazil we have the second biggest set of social workers in the world, 
        the USA having the first one.</p>
      <p>According to Yazbek, Martinelli and Raichelis (2008), "the critical production 
        about the profession is concentrated in Brazil, and it has to be considered 
        that all the doctoral courses are in Brazilian universities, being such 
        courses responsible for the qualification of the first masters and doctors 
        in the area in Latin American and European countries".</p>
      <p>In the past three decades, the area has presented a great development 
        in its academic production, and such production, besides having contributed 
        to develop new and improved professional interventions in the several 
        fields of the social policies, has achieved the writing of hundreds of 
        books, articles, reviews, and communication of researches. </p>
      <p>Thus, the Brazilian Social Service was enriched when it changed from 
        a discipline almost entirely devoted to <i>intervention</i> to a vigorous 
        area of production of knowledge of the social reality, which decisively 
        contributed to the creation of postgraduation courses that gave a new 
        influx to the research and the production of bibliography of the area.</p>
      <p>Since its creation, in September 1979, the journal <b>Servi&ccedil;o Social &amp; Sociedade</b> has had an editorial politics directed to giving voice 
        to the valuable academic and professional production of social workers 
        and related professionals, as well as it has also shown the socialpolitical 
        development of the Social Service and the thinking of its representative 
        bodies.</p>
      <p>The periodical was created at the end of the military government, when 
        several social and popular movements were questioning the authoritarian 
        State and were demanding democratic liberties. This was the same period 
        when there was large unions' mobilization leading to the big strikes at 
        ABC and to the creation of Partido dos Trabalhadores and CUT.</p>
      <p>Those were the circumstances that marked the process of rearticulation 
        of the politicalprofessional forces in the Brazilian society and in the 
        Social Services, which promoted diversification and democratization in 
        the ways social workers expressed themselves and researched. In this sense, 
        the creation of the journal <i>Servi&ccedil;o Social &amp;</i> <i>Sociedade</i> 
        was contemporary with the significant renewal of the Social Service, and 
        it keeps on contributing to the academic and professional development 
        of this area of knowledge and intervention in the reality, as well as 
        the development of related areas.</p>
      <p>It is the first journal of Social Services to have a national circulation, 
        and it is one of the most important periodicals of reference for professors 
        and university students, researchers and professionals who try to keep 
        up with the debate about the important national and international issues 
        that reflect on the Social Services and the Social and Human Sciences.</p>
      <p>According to researcher Maria Ozanira da Silva e Silva, "it is the only 
        Latin American periodical that has got to number 100 with a regular flow 
        of publication for thirty years". The same researcher emphasizes the "recent 
        classification in the A1 Stratum in the Capes / MEC's Qualis System Periodicals" 
        (SILVA E SILVA, 2009, p. 601).</p>
      <p><b>Aims:</b> To make the academic and professional production by social 
        workers and related researchers known, as well as contributing to the 
        debate and critical and analytical deepening of the social theory, with 
        emphasis on themes related to the Brazilian and Latin American reality. 
      </p>
      <p><b>Areas of interest:</b> Applied Social Sciences, Human Sciences, Social 
        Services, Ethics, Political Science, Public Policies, Health.</p>
      <p><b>Additional information:</b> The graphic and editorial project of the 
        journal has been reformulated every 50 issues since its creation in order 
        to modernize and improve its visual quality, so that the journal becomes 
        more and more attractive and easier to handle. The last reformulation 
        happened in number 100, September / December 2009. Besides that, in the 
        special issues published to mark each decade of existence, <b>Servi&ccedil;o Social &amp; Sociedade</b> has invited researchers and professionals 
        to debate a theme of interest to the area, and that debate is ultimately 
        revised and edited to be published in its pages, which has been very well 
        received by the public of the journal. In Issue 100 there was an even 
        further innovation, because two DVDs with the whole reproduction of the 
        debate promoted by the journal to celebrate its thirty years of existence 
        were added to the issue.</p>
      <p><b>Frequency</b>: Quarterly</p>
      <p>Its abbreviated title is <b>Serv. Soc. Soc.</b>, which should be used in 
        bibliographies, footnotes and bibliographical references and legends.</p>
