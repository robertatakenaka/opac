      <p>The <b>Journal <i>Trans/Form/A&ccedil;&atilde;o</i></b> publishes articles 

        in the field of philosophy. Proposals are blind-examined by two <b>anonymous</b> 

        referees. All the articles published are peer-reviewed by referees of 

        academic titulation equal to or higher than that of the author, except 

        when the editor invites a thinker of notorious knowledge in Philosophy 

        to contribute with an essay. The journal is directed primarily to academic 

        research in Philosophy but also aims at the learned and interested layman, 

        thus allowing the researchers that propose the articles to reach a universal 

        criterion of clarity. <o:p></o:p></p>

      <p>Also, the goal of the journal is to maintain its ranking as a high-standard 

        publication, as attested by the Qualis score issued by Capes (Classification 

        of Periodicals, Annals, Journals and Magazines of <i>Capes</i>, Coordination 

        for Higher Level Graduates Improvement, a Foundation within the Brazilian 

        Ministry of Education); <b>therefore, Capes requirements will also be 

        followed</b>. This poses the need to establish a regional proportionality 

        in the publication of articles from 2006 onwards, <b>always</b> preserving 

        the quality of the submissions: a desirable maximum of 10% <b>articles 

        from Unesp</b>, a maximum of 60% articles from S&atilde;o Paulo (<b>including 

        Unesp</b>), and a minimum of 1 article from abroad. Exceptions may take 

      place depending on the editor's decisions.</p>
      <p> The mission of the Consulting Commission is to advise the Editorial Commission, 
        
        that is, to express its view on submitted articles, refer articles from 
        
        third parties, issue opinions, and present articles for publication (which 
        
        may be forwarded to referees).

        <o:p></o:p></p>
      <p>The Journal Trans / Form / Action does not charge submission fees or evaluation of articles, reviews and translations, being an entirely free posting for authors.</p></td>

      <p><b>1. Originality</b></p>

    <p><strong>TRANS/FORM/A&Ccedil;&Atilde;O</strong> publishes original articles in  the form of regular essays, translations, reviews and interviews. The writer  who publishes material in this journal must wait at least four numbers (two  years) before submitting another manuscript.</p>
    <p><strong>2.  Theme</strong></p>
    <p>The themes dealt with must pertain to the field  of philosophy or present a philosophical approach to the topic treated. They  may derive from research work or be informative in nature. Translations must be  of classic philosophical texts. Reviews will only be accepted for books that  have been in publication for two years or less.</p>
    <p><strong>3.  Review by Referees</strong></p>
    <p>Referees are preferably professors of  postgraduate programs in philosophy. Modifications and/or corrections suggested  by the referees regarding the manuscript (concerning the comprehension of the  text or grammar issues) or the content of its contributions shall be forwarded  to the respective authors, who will be allowed a short period of time to make  the proposed modifications.</p>
    <p><strong>4.  General information</strong></p>
    <p>Manuscripts submitted for publication must be  submitted on-line through the journal homepage in &ldquo;blind mode&rdquo; (lacking any  data which could identify the author) and as Word (.doc, .docx) or Rich Text  Format (.rtf) files. Papers are accepted in Portuguese, Spanish, French,  English, or Italian. Manuscripts in blind mode are evaluated (normally by an  editor or member of the editorial board) as to their formatting and relevance  for publication in the journal; they are then sent to referees.</p>
    <p><strong>5.  Manuscript Preparation</strong></p>
    <p>Manuscripts must be submitted in Word (.doc,  .docx) or Rich Text Format (.rtf), Times New Roman font, 12 point size, with  1.5 spacing, and have an average length of 18 pages. The following sequence of  items should be observed in submitted manuscripts: title, abstract (minimum of  100 and maximum of 250 words), keywords (maximum of five items), main text,  acknowledgements (if desired), abstract in English, keywords in English, and  references in alphabetical order by author’s last name. The abstract and  keywords at the head of the article must be in the language of the main text.  The abstract must also to be translated into English and included after the  main text, or presented in Portuguese after the main text when the original  manuscript is submitted in English. Notes to the text should be included in  footnotes and in the bibliographical references at the end of the main text.</p>
    <p><strong>5.1  Bibliography</strong></p>
    <p>References must be organized in alphabetical  order by the first author’s last name and formatted according to the NBR  6023/2002 guidelines, as in the following examples:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>a)  Books and other monographs:</strong><br>
        CHAU&Iacute;, Marilena. <em>A nervura do real</em>. S&atilde;o  Paulo: Companhia das Letras, 1999.</p>
      <p><strong>b)  Book chapters:</strong></p>
      <p>&#150; when the author of a chapter is the same as that of  the entire book:<br>
        MOURA,  Carlos A. R. de. Hobbes, Locke e a medida do direito. In: ______.<em>Racionalidade  e crise</em>. S&atilde;o Paulo: Discurso Editorial, 2001.p. 43-61.</p>
      <p>&#150; when the author of a chapter is different from that  of the entire book:<br>
        ARRUDA,  Antonio T. M. Determinismo, responsabilidade e sentimentos morais. In:  GONZALEZ, Maria E. Q.; BROENS, Mariana C.; MARTINS, Cl&eacute;lia A. (Orgs.). <em>Informa&ccedil;&atilde;o, conhecimento e a&ccedil;&atilde;o &eacute;tica. </em>Mar&iacute;lia:  Oficina Universit&aacute;ria; S&atilde;o Paulo: Cultura Acad&ecirc;mica, 2012. p. 21-36.</p>
      <p><strong>c)  Dissertations and theses:</strong><br>
        FORTES, Luiz R. S. <em>Rousseau da teoria &agrave;  pr&aacute;tica</em>. 1973. 157 f. Tese (Doutorado em Filosofia) – Faculdade de  Filosofia, Letras e Ci&ecirc;ncias Humanas, Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo, S&atilde;o Paulo,  1973.</p>
      <p><strong>d) Journal articles (complete titles must be given):</strong><br>
        WERLE,  Marco A. A ang&uacute;stia, o nada e a morte em Heidegger. <em>Trans/Form/A&ccedil;&atilde;o, </em>Mar&iacute;lia, v.26, n.1, p. 97-113, 2003.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>5.2  Citations</strong></p>
<p>Citations should follow the NBR 10520/2002 norms  of the ABNT. Examples are given below.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>a) Direct citation &#150;</strong> This is a  transcription of part of the text of an author, reproduced in double quotes and  accompanied by information about the source (author, date, page number). For  example:</p>
  <p>For this reason, Luhmann (1995, p.35) states that  &ldquo;action systems must always reproduce actions, not cells, macromolecules,  ideas, and so forth&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>or</p>
  <p>  The  environment functions as &ldquo;[…] the system&rsquo;s <em>ground</em>,  and a ground is always <em>without form</em>&rdquo;  (LUHMANN, 1995, p.444).
  </p>
  <p><strong>b) Long direct citations:</strong> citations of over three lines must be separated from the main text as an  independent paragraphs, indented 4 centimeters form the left margin, in 10  point type, single spaced, and without quotation marks. For example:</p>
  <p>This is what Luhmann is presumably referring to when  he says:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>  One  can call a system self-referential if it itself constitutes the elements that  compose it as functional unities and runs reference to this self-constitution  through all the relations among these elements, continuously reproducing its  self-constitution in this way. In this sense, self-referential systems  necessarily operate by self-contact; they possess no other form of  environmental contact than this self-contact. (LUHMANN, 1995, p.33).
      </p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>c) Indirect citation:</strong> This occurs when ideas and information are reproduced from the work  cited, but without transcribing the author’s words. For example:</p>
  <p>  Since  Plato (1972, p.163), the essence of things has been thought of as being outside  of things themselves, as inhabiting a world – the world of ideas – in which the  identical and the one exclude any sort of contradiction or non-being.
  </p>
  <p><strong>d)  Multiple works by the same author in the same year</strong> are to be differentiated by small letters added after the year, without spacing  (M&aacute;rques, 2003a), (M&aacute;rques, 2003b). </p>
  <p><strong>e)  For works with two authors</strong>, names should be separated  by a semi-colon (e.g. BROENS; GONZ&Aacute;LES, 2005). In the case of three or more  authors, the form <em>et al.</em> is used  after first author’s name (HASELAGER et al., 1999).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>5.3  Notes</strong></p>
    <p>Notes must be kept to a minimum and placed at  the bottom of  pages as consecutively  numbered footnotes.</p>
    <p><strong>5.4  Annexes and/or supplements</strong></p>
    <p>These should be included only when vital for the  understanding of the text.</p>
    <p><strong>5.5  Authorship</strong></p>
    <p>The data and concepts presented in the work, as  well as the accuracy of bibliographical citations, are the entire  responsibility of the authors. Manuscripts that do not follow the previously  mentioned guidelines will be returned to authors, with comments on the required  alterations. Manuscripts must be submitted on-line through the journal  homepage. The author must include all pertinent information requested by the  system (institution, affiliation, address, telephone, e-mail). Incorrect or  missing information on the system may invalidate your submission. Note that  Trans/Form/A&ccedil;&atilde;o does not normally publish texts by graduate students, generally  accepting only texts from PhD-holding   researchers. That being said, it is important to note that the journal  may accept some works outside of these conditions, in character of an  exception, if it considers this reasonable.</p></td>

      <p>Authors are required to verify compliance of  submitted articles with respect to all items listed below. Submissions that do  not conform to these standards will be returned.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Manuscripts submitted for publication should be  sent in &quot;blind evaluation&quot; format (without data identifying the  author) through the online SEER platform at the magazine's homepage.  Submissions must be in Word (.doc) or RTF format (.rtf).</li>
        <li> Papers written in Portuguese, Spanish, Italian,  French, and English are accepted. They should be submitted in Times New Roman  font, size 12, with line spacing of 1.5. Articles accepted for publication have  an average length of 20 pages.</li>
        <li>Author identification is done entirely through  registering in the system, not as part of the text. Incorrect or incomplete  completion of data, and any problems in author registration, may invalidate  your submission. It is important to emphasize that the journal does not  customarily accept works by students or those without a doctorate, but exceptions  may be made to this rule if deemed reasonable.
