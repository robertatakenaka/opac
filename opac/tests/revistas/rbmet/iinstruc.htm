      <p>The RBMET is edited and published by the Brazilian Meteorological Society 
        and it is the main way to disseminate the researches in progress of the 
        Meteorological Community. Typically these research results are from studies 
        in meteorology and its sub-areas such as climatology, synoptic, hydrometeorology, 
        remote sensing of the atmosphere, atmospheric and climatic modeling. Articles 
        from international and Latin American community researchers are also published. 
        In RBMET there is also space for article of scientific reviews, in which 
        is presented the state of art in atmospheric sciences. All the articles 
        are revised by specialized professionals ("peer review process") and kept 
        in anonymity.</p>
      <p>The target public is the scientific community of meteorologists from 
        Brazil and Latin American countries such as Argentina, Chile, Peru, Cuba 
        and Mexico. This public is typically associated with private and public 
        university, and also with research and operational institutions such as 
        INMET (National Institute of Meteorology), CPTEC/INPE (Center for Weather 
        Forecast and Climatic Studies of the National Institute of Space Research), 
        SIMEPAR (Meteorological System of the Paran&aacute;), FUNCEME (Meteorological 
        Foundation of Cear&aacute;) and others.</p>
      <p>Graduate and under graduate students from Brazilian universities are 
        a potential public of RBMET. Other researchers from related areas such 
        as agro-meteorologists, hydrologists and engineers can also have benefits.</p>
