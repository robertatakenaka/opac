      <p><b>References:</b> All works quoted in the text should be listed at the  end of the article, according to the following sample:</p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>Details about translations, editions, reprints, etc.,  should be mentioned:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>KANT, I. <i>Kritik der reinen Vernunft</i>. Second edition. Riga: Johann Freidrich  Hartknoch, 1787. Transl. by N. Kemp Smith, London: Macmillan, 1929.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>For reprinted works, the details about the original  edition should be given, but the pages can be just those of the reprinted  edition:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>PUTNAM, H.  "Mathematics without foundations". <i>The Journal of Philosophy</i>, LXIV, I,  1967.&nbsp; Repr. in H. Putnam (1979), pp.  43-59.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Books containing articles are cited separately:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>HAAPARANTA,  L., HINTIKKA, J. <i>Frege Synthesized</i>. Dordrecht: Reidel Publishing Co., 1986.</p>
        <p>        VAN HEIJENOORT, J.  "Frege on Vagueness". In L. Haaparanta and J. Hintikka (eds.) (1986), pp.  31-45.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>        Please follow carefully the punctuation convention in  the samples above, and be as complete as possible regarding the facts of  publication.</p>
      <p><b>Quotations:</b>        The author (date) convention should be used for  quotations internal to the text:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"See Quine  (1948), Devitt (1980), Lewis (1983)."</p>
        <p>"...with H. P.  Grice's conceptual creature construction (1975)."</p>
        <p>Further details follow a coma after the date, as in:</p>
        <p>Putnam  (1964, p. 1) claims that a new philosophy of science is being constructed.</p>
        <p>As Carston  (1988, pp. 161-2) has argued...</p>
        <p>According to  Frege (1884, &sect; 62), numbers can be defined by abstraction.</p>
        <p>Frege's second  definition of number (1884, &sect;&sect; 62-4) failed for other reasons.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Footnotes should not be used for normal quotations;  these shoud be incorporated in the text, using the author (date) convention.  For all articles or books quoted, the date used in the text should be the one  of the original publication, and not the one of the reprint, even if the page  references are to the reprint. Thus, an author referring to Putnam's  "Mathematics without foundations" (originally published in 1967), using the  second reprinted edition in Putnam's book <i>Mathematics, Matter and Method </i>(published  in 1979) would quote from the first page of the article in the following way:  "(Putnam 1967, p. 43)".</p>
      <p>        Short  quotations may appear just enclosed in double quotation marks. Longer quotations  should appear as indented material, preceded and succeeded by a line space, and  should not be enclosed in quotation marks. The information about the source of  the reference should appear as part of the indented material, after the full  stop, according to the following sample:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>This, I think, is characteristic of metaphysics,  or at least of that part of metaphysics called ontology: one who regards a  statement on this subject as true at all must regard it as trivially true.  One's ontology is basic to the conceptual scheme by which he interprets all  experiences, even the most commonplace ones. (Quine 1953, p. 10)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><b>Quotation of  Classical Works:</b> For  classical works, authors might prefer&nbsp; to  use an abbreviation instead of the date. For example, an author referring to  Kant's <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> could write "According to Kant (<i>CPR</i>,  B 43)..." or "According to Kant (<i>KrV</i>, B 43)...". The abbreviation used  should be mentioned in the reference section at the end, as in</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>KANT, I. <i>Kritik der reinen Vernunft</i>. (<i>KrV</i>) Second  edition. Riga:  Johann Freidrich Hartknoch, 1787. Transl. By N. Kemp Smith, London: Macmillan, 1929.</p>
      </blockquote>
<p>Classical articles might be quoted by their name,  enclosed in quotation marks:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Frege draws in "The  Thought" a famous comparison between logic and ethics.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><b>Quotation marks:</b>        Single quotation marks should be used for mentioning a  word or symbol, as in </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>By 'Cicero'I shall  mean the man who denounced Catiline; and that's what the reference of 'Cicero' will be.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>For mentioning an expression within anoter one that is  already enclosed in single quotation marks, please use double quotation marks  as in</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>If one was  determining the referent of a name like 'Glunk' to himself and made the  following decision, 'I shall use the term "Glunk" to refer to the man I call  "Glunk"', this would get one nowhere. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Otherwise, double quotation marks should be used  only for quoting, or to suggest special usage (irony, etc).</p>
      <p><b>Footnotes:</b> For notes, please use footnotes (numbered with arabic  numerals), and not endnotes. Quotations within footnotes follow the same  conventions above.</p>
<p><b>Acknowledgement footnote:</b> If  the author decides to include an acknowledgement footnote, this should be  referenced at the title, indicated with an '*' (i.e., not numbered).</p>
      <p><b>Logical  symbolism:</b> Variables,  predicate letters, Greek characters, etc. should be italicized.</p>
      <p><b>Foreign words:</b> Foreign  words (to the language in which the article is written, of course) should be  italicized.</p>
      <p><b>Abstract and  Key-words:</b> An abstract (of approximately ten lines) and some  key-words (not more than six) must be included immediately after the author's  institutional address. Please include also an English version of the abstract,  even if the article is not written in English.</p></td>
