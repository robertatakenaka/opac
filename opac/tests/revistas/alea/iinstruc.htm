  <p><strong>Alea: Neo-Latin Studies</strong> was created in 1999 with the aim of providing a framework for research  exchange between the Postgraduate Program in Neo-Latin Letters and similar  postgraduate programs in the country, thus promoting debate among researchers –  both academics and students – and also between society and academia.  Additionally, in the long term the journal also sought to forge close ties  between the Postgraduate Program in Neo-Latin Letters and foreign universities,  with a view to keeping abreast of current developments in the language and  literature areas taught and researched at our university, whilst also serving  as a platform to promote the excellent research work carried out in Brazilian  universities in the field of modern foreign languages and literature, in  particular work related to Neo-Latin cultures.   One of the journal’s key features is its receptiveness to comparative  studies around a central theme, which has made it possible to contrast what the  languages and literatures studied in the Postgraduate Program in Neo-Latin  Letters owe to, or offer, others; or how they rewrite universal issues or how  their own issues are being received or rewritten by other cultures. To boost  the journal’s circulation within Brazil and abroad we sought support from  various academics and researchers from prestigious universities, all of whom  happily agreed to collaborate with our editorial endeavour. Similarly, the journal  gradually started to benefit from increased participation of researchers from  foreign institutions, who collaborated either as authors or guest editors for  special thematic issues. Also on board came many other researchers from across  Brazil whose work is renowned in their specialist areas. From the second issue  onwards, the journal has been including a dissertation and thesis review  section, which has proved an extremely valuable tool to promote MA and PhD  level research, and make it accessible to other researchers. Furthermore, we  also continue publishing translations and critical reviews in order to promote  recent publications in the field.</p>
  <p> Created by the Postgraduate Program in Neo-Latin Letters (with support  from Programa de Apoyo al Postgrado de la Capes), since 2001 the journal also  receives support from Programa de Apoyo a las Publicaciones Científicas of the  CNPq.</p>
