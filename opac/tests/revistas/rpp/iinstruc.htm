      <p><strong><em>Revista  Paulista de Pediatria</em></strong>&nbsp;[S&atilde;o Paulo Pediatrics  Journal] is a quarterly publication of S&atilde;o Paulo Pediatrics Society (SPSP,  acronyms in Portuguese). Since 1982, it publishes original contributions,  reviews and clinical case reports of methodological research, with discussions on  the health and research field of newborns, infants, children, and adolescents&rsquo;  diseases. The purpose is to disclose research with methodological quality  related to themes about children and adolescent&rsquo;s health. Full articles are  electronically available in Portuguese and English, and can be accessed at  SciELO without paying charges, in electronic format and for open access. The journal is indexed in the following databases: PubMed Central,  Medline, Scopus, Embase (Excerpta Medica Database), SciELO (Scientific  Electronic Library Online), LILACS (<em>Literatura  Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ci&ecirc;ncias da Sa&uacute;de</em>)<em>,</em>&nbsp;Index Medicus Latino-Americano (IMLA) BR, <em>Sum&aacute;rios de Revistas Brasileiras</em>, and  Redalyc (<em>Red de Revistas Cient&iacute;ficas de  Am&eacute;rica Latina y el Caribe, Espa&ntilde;a y</em> Portugal Scientific Information  System).</p>
      <p>OPEN ACCESS</p>
      <p> Every peer-reviewed  article, approved by the journal&rsquo;s editorial board, will be published with open  access. This means the text will be worldwide available via the Internet in  perpetuity and without charges. The authors are not requested to pay charges.

All articles will be  published with the following license: <em>Creative  Commons Attribution 4.0 International</em> (CC-BY), which provides guidance in the reuse of this article.</p>
      <p> REVIEW PROCESS</p>
      <p> Every submitted article is sent to the editor-in-chief, who checks if it  follows the minimum standards specified in the publication standards and if it fits  the Journal&rsquo;s objectives. Then, the article is sent to two experts in the area,  blind as to the article&rsquo;s authorship, to be examined, with a specific form for  review. After this review is done, the Journal&rsquo;s editors decide if the article  will be accepted without modifications, if it should be refused or if it should  be sent to the authors for modifications and for later reassessment. In case of  the latter, the editors reassess the article for a later decision regarding  acceptance, refusal or need of new modifications.</p>

Use descriptors exclusively from the list included in  the &ldquo;Health Sciences Descriptors&rdquo;, prepared by BIREME and available at <a href="http://decs.bvs.br/" target="_blank">http://decs.bvs.br/</a>. This  list shows the corresponding terms in both Portuguese and English languages.</p>
      <p><strong>TEXT:</strong></p>
      <p><u>Original article</u>: divided  into <u>Introduction</u> (short with 4 to 6 paragraphs, it should only justify  the paper and has the objectives in its end); <u>Method</u> (specify the study  outline, describe the studied population and the selection methods, define the  used procedures, detail the statistical method. Declaring the approval of the  procedures by the Research Ethics Committee of the Institution is compulsory); <u>Results</u> (clear and objective &ndash; the author should not repeat the information provided in  tables and graphics within the text); <u>Discussion</u> (interpret the results  and compare them with literature data, by putting emphasis on the important  aspects of the study and its implications, as well as its limitations &ndash; this  section must end with pertinent conclusions regarding the objectives of the  study).</p>
      <p>  <u>Review articles</u>: they do  not obey a strict scheme of sections, but we recommend they contain an  introduction to emphasize the importance of the theme, its review, followed by  comments and, if necessary, recommendations.</p>
      <p>  <u>Case reports</u>: they  are divided into <u>Introduction</u> (short with 3 to 5 paragraphs, to  emphasize the knowledge regarding the discussed disease or procedure); <u>Case  description</u> (do not include data that could identify the patient), and <u>Discussion</u> (a comparison with other literature cases and the innovative or relevant  perspective of the case).</p>
      <p>  <strong>TABLES, GRAPHICS AND ILLUSTRATIONS</strong> </p>
      <p>      Only 4 tables and 2 illustrations, including figures and graphics, are  allowed in each article. They must be sent in the same file of the article. In  the event of approval, figures and graphics with a better resolution will be  requested.</p>
      <p>  <strong>Tables</strong></p>
      <p>        To avoid tables on the horizontal position, <strong>Revista  Paulista de Pediatria</strong> recommends that authors use 100 characters at most in  each line of the table. However, if the table has two or more columns, the  author should remove 5 characters per line. For example: If there are two  columns, the author should use 95 at most; if there are three, 90; and so on.  Up to 4 tables are allowed per article, which should be on the limits of one  page each. Explanations should be on the footprint of the table, instead in the  title. Do not include a space beside the symbol &plusmn;. Type the tables in the text  processor Word by using lines and columns &ndash; do not separate the columns as  tabulation marks. Do not import Excel or PowerPoint tables.</p>
      <p>  <strong>Graphics</strong></p>
      <p>        Number the graphics according to the order  they appear in the text and add a title below them. Graphics should have two  dimensions, be in black/white (do not color them) and be developed in  PowerPoint. Send the .ppt file apart from the text: do not import the graphics  to the text. <strong>Revista Paulista de Pediatria</strong> does not accept digitalized  graphics.</p>
      <p>  <strong>Figures</strong></p>
      <p> Figures should be numbered in the order they  appear in the text. Explanations should be in the subtitles (send the subtitle  together with the manuscript&rsquo;s text file, in a separate page). Figures from  other sources should indicate this piece of information in the subtitle and  have a written permission of the source for its reproduction. <u>The author  must obtain permission for the reproduction of images</u>. The patients&rsquo; photos  must not contain any piece of information that would enable identifying the  subject &ndash; if there is a possibility of identification, a letter of consent is <u>compulsory</u> and it should be signed by the photographed subject or his/her guardian, who  should allow the material&rsquo;s disclosure. Images created in a computer should be  attached in the formats .jpg, .gif or .tif with a minimum resolution of 300  dpi. <strong>Revista Paulista de Pediatria</strong> does not accept digitalized pictures.</p>
      <p>  <strong>FUNDING</strong></p>
      <p> Declare funding sources before the conflict of interests. The names of CAPES,  CNPq and other institutions should be written without abbreviations with their  country. Do not repeat the support in the acknowledgments section. If there was  no funding source, write: &ldquo;The study does not have a funding source.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>
        <strong>DECLARATION OF CONFLICT OF INTERESTS </strong></p>
      <p> Describe any connection of the authors with companies that might be interested  in disclosing the manuscript submitted for publishing. If there is no conflict  of interests, write: &ldquo;The authors declare no conflict of interests.&rdquo; This  statement should be in the front page before the funding source.</p>
      <p>  <strong>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</strong></p>
      <p>        Thank people or institutions that contributed to the study, but who are not the  authors, in a concise manner. Acknowledgments should be placed when sending the  second version of the article, in order to avoid conflicts of interest with the  reviewers. Do not repeat the institution who financially supported the project  in the acknowledgments; it should only be mentioned in the financial support  section.</p>
      <p>  <strong>REFERENCES</strong></p>
      <p><strong>In the text:&nbsp;</strong>They should be numbered and ordered according to the  order of appearance in the text. References in the text must be identified with  superscripted Arabic numbers, without parentheses and after punctuation.</p>
