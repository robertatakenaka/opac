    <p><strong>Manuscript  categories:</strong><br>
          <strong>Editorial:</strong>&nbsp;Any  researcher may write the editorial on the invitation of the Editors in Chief.  Editorials should cover broad aspects of Aerospace Technology, with scientific  content. &nbsp;Such manuscripts are not submitted to peer review</p>
      <p>          <strong>Review articles</strong>: These  should cover subjects that are relevant to the scope of the journal.  &nbsp;Authors should bear in mind that they are expected to have expertise in  the reviewed field. The article may be of any length required for the concise  presentation of the subject</p>
      <p>          <strong>Original papers</strong>: These  articles should report results of the scientific research. The article should  not present more than 60,000 characters with space, as succinct papers are  favored in terms of impact as well as in readability</p>
      <p>          <strong>Communications:</strong>&nbsp;They  should report previous results of ongoing research and should not content more  than 40,000 characters with space. </p>
      <p>Papers already presented at conferences will  be accepted if they were not published in complete form in the Annals of the  conference or if they are extended with additional results or new findings.  These articles will be evaluated as the others.</p>
      <p>The use of copyrighted material, such as,  figures, tables, drawings, etc. from other sources (including the Internet)  needs a written permission. Authors are the solely responsible to get the  required permissions, and to present them at the time of the submission.</p>
      <p>Articles from guest authors  will be published after approval of one specialist Section Editor. </p>
      <p>The JATM  does not publish translated articles from other journals.</p>
      <p>          <strong>Evaluation</strong><br>
      The manuscripts will be received by the assistant  editors who initially will verify the similarity of the content (plagiarism)  using the iThenticate system. For manuscripts with no or low content of  similarity, a Section Editor (SE) will be assigned. The SE will appoint 2 to 4  external evaluators (<em>ad hoc</em>&nbsp;referees) in double-blind peer review  mode, ensuring complete anonymity.&nbsp; After receiving the evaluations, the  SE must give a decision about the manuscript addressing the evaluator&rsquo;s  recommendations. The SE can accept the manuscript in the form it was submitted;  can reject it or request revisions. The manuscript that requires revision will  be sent to the author, who is supposed to submit a new version and a letter to  the Editor, where each recommendation of the evaluators should be commented. The additional paragraphs should be highlighted.  In  the case the author does not agree with the evaluator&rsquo;s suggestions, it is  necessary to explain the reasons. &nbsp;After verifying the adherence to the  recommendations in the new version, the SE should give the final decision or,  exceptionally, send to another evaluation round if the changes have not been  sufficiently addressed. &nbsp;The entire process is available to the authors at  any moment. In the cases the authors do not agree with the final decision, it  is allowed to appeal on the decision by sending an email to the Executive  Editor, who will review the process and ask for reconsideration to the Editors  in Chief, if justified.</p>

      <p>The manuscript should be digitalized using a  Microsoft&reg; Office document (.docx), 12-pt. Times New Roman, double-spaced  throughout, justified paragraphs and leaving one space after a period. Do not try to fit the manuscript in the final  template.&nbsp; Top level headings should be centered on the page, using upper  and lower case. Second level headings should be flush left, italicized, using  upper and lower case, without numbering. &nbsp;For those authors that prefer to  edit in LaTex, submit a PDF file instead.&nbsp; Authors are also strongly  advised to use abbreviations sparingly whenever possible to improve the  readability of the manuscript. Do not include a list of symbols, nomenclature  and/or abbreviations.&nbsp; Instead, define them at the first time they appear  in text. Accepted manuscripts can be edited by the editorial office to comply  with the format of the journal, remove redundancies, and improve clarity and  understanding without altering meaning.&nbsp; The edited text will be presented  to authors for approval.</p>
      <p> To ensure the integrity of the blind peer-review  process, it is mandatory to prevent the identities of the authors. So, check if  the following steps have been taken with regard to the text and the file  properties: (1) delete the authors&rsquo; name from the text, with &ldquo;Author&rdquo; and year  used in citation and in the references, instead of the authors&rsquo; name, article  title etc.; (2) do not include the section &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;; (3) do not include the section &quot;Author's contribution&quot;; and (4) author  identification should also be removed from the properties of the file. In the copyediting step, after approval of the manuscript, the corresponding author will be requested to complete all this informations.</p>
      <p><strong>Manuscript  structure</strong><br>
        Whenever possible, manuscripts should include the  following subsections; however, articles from some areas should follow their  usual format. Please, do not number the sections. Use different style for  differentiate subsections:</p>
      <p><em><strong>Title and names of authors:</strong></em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>The title should not contain abbreviations. All  authors should be identified with full name, email, institution to which they  are related, city, state, and country. One of them should be indicated as the  author for correspondence and his/her full postal address is required.</p>
      <p><em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>They are limited to 250 words and structured into  objectives, methods, results, and conclusions. Citations or abbreviations  (except internationally recognized abbreviations, such as weights, measures,  and physical or chemical ones) are not permitted.</p>
      <p><em><strong>Keywords:</strong></em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>&nbsp;It is highly recommended to choose the keywords  accurately, selecting three to six items based on NASA Thesaurus volume 2 &ndash;  Access Vocabulary, which can be accessed at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sti.nasa.gov/thesvol2.pdf" target="_blank" title="Go to external source">http://www.sti.nasa.gov/thesvol2.pdf</a></p>
      <p><em><strong>Introduction:</strong></em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>It should set the purpose of the study, providing a  brief summary (not a review) of previous relevant studies, and stating the new  advances in the current investigation. The introduction should not include data  or conclusions from the work being reported. A final sentence summarizing the  novel finding to be presented is permissible.</p>
      <p><em><strong>Methodology:</strong></em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>The authors are free to use any structure in this  section to fit the objectives of the study. They could also rename it (<em>e.g.</em>&nbsp;Numerical analysis, Case study, and so  on), and in some cases it may be advisable to omit it. Clear and sufficient  information to permit the study to be repeated by others should be briefly  given. Standard techniques need only to be referenced. Previously published  methods may be briefly described following the reference.</p>
      <p><em><strong>Results:</strong></em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>This section should be a concise account of the new  information that was discovered, with the least personal judgment. Do not  repeat in text all the data in the tables and illustrations, but briefly  describe what these data comprise.</p>
      <p>        <em><strong>Discussion:</strong></em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>The discussion should include the significance of the  new information and relevance of the new findings in light of existing  knowledge. Only unavoidable citations should be included. Citations to review  articles are not encouraged in this section. In some cases, this section may be  advisable to merge with the previous section (&ldquo;Results and Discussion&rdquo;).</p>
      <p><em><strong>Acknowledgements:</strong></em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>This section should be dedicated for those who did not participate  directly in achieving the results presented in the paper. The financial support received for the  elaboration of the manuscript must be declared in this item. Also, references  to personal or private communication placed in running text should be  acknowledged in this section. This session will appear only in the copyediting  step. It must not appear in the manuscript.</p>
       <p><em><strong>Author's contribution: </strong></em>JATM endorses the CRediT taxonomy of contributor roles and encourage authors to use this taxonomy when providing an Author Contributions section for your manuscripts according to this example: Conceptualization, Smith J and Silva A; Methodology, Smith J; Investigation, Smith J; Morais M  and Silva A; Writing - Original Draft, Smith J; Morais M  and Silva A; Writing - Review & Editing, Smith J; Funding Acquisition, Morais M  and Silva A; Resources, Morais M  and Silva A; Supervision, Smith J.</p>
      <p><em><strong>References:</strong></em>&nbsp;Acceptable references include journal articles,  numbered papers, books, and submitted articles, if the journal is identified.  References must be restricted to directly relevant papers or abstracts that  have been accepted for publication. Self-citation should be limited to a  minimum. Authors are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of their  references.</p>
      <p><strong>&nbsp;Style and format citation</strong> <br>
        The JATM uses the name-year system. The references  should be mentioned in the text by giving the last name of the author and the year  of publication: Smith 1997. For articles with 2 authors, use the form: Smith  and Farias 1997. With 3 or more names, use the form: Smith&nbsp;<em>et  al.</em>&nbsp;1997. If two or  more references have the same identification, distinguish them by appending  &ldquo;a&rdquo;, &ldquo;b&rdquo; etc. to the year of publication. Where citing more than one reference,  they should be separated by semicolon. Standards should be cited in text by the  acronym of the entity followed by the number, and they do not appear in the  references list. &nbsp;Organization as author should be cited by the acronym.  &nbsp;For the in-text reference of websites or other online formats, include  only the first word or two words of the title (enough to distinguish it from  other titles in the references list), followed by an ellipsis (APSnet . . .  c1994&ndash;2005). &nbsp;References to personal or private communication should be  cited as in this example: ... and most of these parameters (2012 Final project  of Carvalho DS; unreferenced, see &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; section) were used to &hellip;</p>
      <p> The references list is unnumbered and appears in  alphabetical order by author and year of publication, with multiple studies by  the same author listed in chronological order.<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>It is highly recommended  that each reference contains the digital object identifier number (doi). References  retrieved from the Internet should be cited by the last name of the author(s)  and the year of publication, or n.d., if not available, followed by the date of  access. Some examples are as the following ones:</p>
      <p><strong>Journals: &nbsp;</strong>List authors in the order in which they appear in the  original text, separated by colon. The year of publication follows the authors  list in parentheses, followed by article and journal title, as well as volume  or issue information. The page range for the article is preceded by colon. &nbsp;Journal  titles are generally abbreviated according to the list of title word  abbreviations maintained by the ISSN International Centre.</p>
