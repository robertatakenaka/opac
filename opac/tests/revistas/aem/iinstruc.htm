      <p>We emphasize the  importance of following these instructions carefully. Failure to do so will  delay the processing of your manuscript.</p>
      <p> Manuscripts should be  submitted solely to the AE&amp;M and should not have been published, or be  under consideration for publication in any substantial form, in another  periodical-either professional or lay.</p>
      <p>Manuscripts should be submitted in English.  Proofreading by a scientific editing service is strongly recommended; the  following companies are&nbsp;suggested:  Voxmed Medical Communications, American Journal Experts and PaperCheck. Manuscripts  that successfully complete the peer-review process and are recommended for  publication will only be accepted and published upon receipt of a certificate  proving professional academic English proofreading. In extraordinary  circumstances, the certificate can be waived by editorial decision.</p>
      <p> Papers that do not  meet these requirements will be returned to the author for the necessary  revisions before formal review.</p>
    <p>All submissions are  initially evaluated in depth by the scientific editors. Papers that do not  conform with the general criteria for publication will be returned to the  authors without detailed review, typically within three to five days.  Otherwise, manuscripts will be sent to reviewers (most commonly two).</p>
    <p>The Journal adopts Crosschek system for plagiarism identification.</p>
    <p>Articles accepted for publication become property of the journal.</p></td>

The  abstract must be self-contained and clear without reference to the text. The  abstract format should include four sections that reflect the section headings  in the main text. All information reported in the abstract must appear in the  MS. Please use complete sentences for all sections of the abstract.</p>
<p><strong>1.3 Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the introduction is draw the  interest of the reader to&nbsp; the article,  with an historical perspective and a justification for the objectives.</p>
<p><strong>1.4 Materials and Methods</strong></p>
<p>These should be described and referenced in sufficient  detail for other investigators to be able to evaluate and repeat the study. The  source of hormones, unusual chemicals and reagents, and special pieces of  apparatus should be stated. For modified methods, only the modifications should  be described.</p>
<p><strong>1.5 Results and Discussion</strong></p>
<p>The Results section should briefly present the  experimental data in text, tables, and/or figures. The repetition, in the text,  of the results presented in the tables should be avoided. For more information  on the preparation of tables and figures, see below. The Discussion should  focus on the interpretation and significance of the findings, with concise  objective comments that describe their relation to other studies in that area.  The Discussion should not reiterate the Results; it should contain suggestions  to explain them, and should end with the conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>1.6 Authorship</strong></p>
<p>The AE&amp;M ascribes to the authorship and  contributorship guidelines defined by the International Committee of Medical  Journal Editors (<a href="www.icmje.org" target="_blank">www.icmje.org</a>). Unrestricted joint authorship is allowed.</p>
<p>Authorship credit should be based only on substantial  contribution to:</p>
<ol><li>The conception and design, or analysis and  interpretation of data;</li>
  <li>The drafting of the article or its critical review for  important intellectual content;</li>
  <li>The final approval of the version to be published.</li>
  </ol>
<p>All these conditions must be met. The corresponding  author is responsible for ensuring that all appropriate contributors are listed  as authors, and that all authors have agreed with the content of the manuscript  and its submission to the AE&amp;M.</p>
<p><strong>1.7 Conflict of interest</strong></p>
<p>A conflict-of-interest statement for all authors  must be included in the main document, after the text, in the Acknowledgments  section. Even if authors have no relevant conflict of interest to disclose,  this should be indicated in the Acknowledgments section.</p>
<p><strong>1.8 Acknowledgments</strong></p>
<p>The Acknowledgments section should include the  names of those people who contributed to a study but did not meet the  requirements for authorship. The corresponding author is responsible for  informing each person listed in the acknowledgment section that they have been  included and which their contribution is. Each person listed in the  acknowledgments must give permission - in writing, if possible - for the use of  his / her name. It is the responsibility of the corresponding author to provide  this information.</p>
<p><strong>1.9 References</strong></p>
<p>References to the literature should be cited in  numerical order (in parentheses) in the text and listed in the same numerical  order at the end of the manuscript on a separate page or pages. The author is  responsible for the accuracy of references. The number of references cited is  limited for each category of submission, as indicated below.</p>
<p><strong>1.10 Tables</strong></p>
<p>Tables should be submitted in the same format as  the article (Word), and not in another format. Please note that tables are no  acceptable as Excel files. Tables should be self-explanatory and the data they  contain must not be duplicated in the text or figures. Tables must be  constructed as simply as possible and be intelligible without reference to the  text. Each table must have a concise heading. A description of experimental  conditions may appear together with footnotes at the foot of the table.</p>
<p><strong>1.11 Graphs and Figures</strong></p>
<p>All graphs and figures must be numbered. The authors  are responsible for digital formatting,&nbsp;  providing digital art that has been properly sized. All color figures  will be reproduced in full color in the online edition of the journal at no  cost to the authors. Authors are requested to pay the cost of reproducing color  figures in the printed issue (the publisher will provide price quotes upon  acceptance of the manuscript).</p>
<p><strong>1.12 Photographs</strong></p>
<p>The AE&amp;M prefers to publish unmasked patient  photos. We encourage all prospective authors to work with families prior to  submission and address the issue of permission for review and possible  publication of patient images. If the MS contains identifiable patient images  or other protected health information, authors have to provide documented  permission from the patient (or the patient's parent, guardian, or legal  representative) before the specific material circulates among editors,  reviewers and staff for the purpose of possible publication in AE&amp;M. If it  is necessary to identify an individual, use a numerical designation (e.g.  Patient 1) rather than using any other identifying notations, such as initials.</p>
<p><strong>1.13 Units of Measure</strong></p>
<p>Results should be expressed in metric units.  Temperature should be expressed in degrees Celsius and time of day using the  24-hour clock (e.g., 0800 h, 1500 h).</p>
<p><strong>1.14 Standard abbreviations</strong></p>
<p>All abbreviations must be immediately defined  after it is first used in the text.</p>
<p><strong>1.15 Patients</strong></p>
<p>For the MS to be considered for publication, all  clinical investigations described in submitted manuscripts must have been  conducted in accordance with the guidelines of The Declaration of Helsinki, and  must have been formally approved by the appropriate institutional review  committees or their equivalent.</p>
<p>The study populations should be described in  detail. Subjects must be identified only by number or letter, not by initials  or names. Photographs of patients' faces should be included only if  scientifically relevant. The authors must obtain written consent from the  patient for the use of such photographs. For further details, see the Ethical  Guidelines.</p>
<p>The authors must disclose potential conflict of  interest to study participants and should indicate in the manuscript that they  have done so.</p>
<p><strong>1.16 Experimental animals</strong></p>
<p>A statement confirming that all animal  experimentation described in the manuscript was conducted in accordance with  accepted standards of humane animal care, as outlined in the Ethical  Guidelines, should be included in the manuscript.</p>
<p><strong>1.17 Molecular Genetics Descriptions</strong></p>
<p>Use standard terminology for variants, providing  rs numbers for all variants reported. The details of the assay (primer  sequences, PCR conditions, etc.) should be described very concisely&nbsp; together with the rs numbers. Pedigrees  should be drawn according to published standards (See Bennett et al. J Genet  Counsel (2008) 17:424-433 -DOI <a href="10.1007/s10897-008-9169-9" target="_blank">10.1007/s10897-008-9169-9</a>).</p>
<p><strong>1.18 Nomenclatures</strong></p>
<p>For genes, use genetic notation and symbols approved by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) - (<a href="http://www.genenames.org/" target="_blank">http://www.genenames.org/</a>).</p>
<p>For mutation nomenclature, please use the  nomenclature guidelines suggested by the Human Genome Variation Society  (<a href="http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/" target="_blank">http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/</a>).</p>
<ul><li>Provide information and a discussion of  departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for the polymorphisms calculated in  the population studied. The calculation of HWE may help uncover genotyping  errors and impact on analytical methods.</li>
  <li>Provide original frequencies of genotypes,  alleles and haplotypes.</li>
  <li>Whenever possible, drugs should be given their  approved generic name. Where a proprietary (brand) name is used, it should  begin with a capital letter.</li>
  <li>Acronyms should be used sparingly and fully  explained when first used.</li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>2. Types of articles</strong></p>
<p>Reports of original research may be submitted to  AE&amp;M as original articles, review articles, case reports, brief reports,  consensus statements, and letters to the editors. The types of articles are  described below.</p>
<p><strong>2.1 Original  articles</strong></p>
<p>The Original Article is a scientific report of the  results of original research that has not been published or submitted for  publication elsewhere (either in print or electronically). It represents a  substantial body of laboratory or clinical work. In general, Original Articles  should not exceed 3,600 words in the main text, include more than six figures  and tables, or more than 35 references in the Vancouver style.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Review  Articles</strong></p>
<p>The AE&amp;M publishes Review Articles that show  a balanced perspective on timely issues within the field of clinical  endocrinology. All reviews are submitted upon invitation and are subject to  peer review.&nbsp; Articles in this category  are requested by the Editors to authors with proven expertise in the field.  Authors considering the submission of uninvited reviews should contact the  editors in advance to determine whether the topic that they propose is of  current potential interest to the Journal.</p>
<p>Review articles should be no longer than 4,000 words  in the main text, include no more than four figures and tables, and no more  than 60 references in the Vancouver style. The authors should mention the  source and/or request authorization for use of previously published figures or  tables.</p>
<p><strong>2.3 Consensus  statements</strong></p>
<p>Consensus Statements related to the endocrine and  metabolic health standards and healthcare practices may be submitted by  professional societies, task forces, and other consortia. All such submissions  will be subjected to peer review, must be modifiable in response to criticism,  and will be published only if they meet the&nbsp;  usual editorial standards of the Journal. Consensus Statements should  typically be no longer than 3,600 words in the main text, include no more than  six figures and tables, and no more than 60 references in the Vancouver style.</p>
<p><strong>2.4 Brief  report</strong></p>
<p>The Brief report consists of new data of  sufficient importance to warrant immediate publication. It is a succinct  description of focused study with important, but very straightforward, negative  or confirmatory results. Brevity and clarity are always likely to enhance the  chance of a manuscript being accepted for publication. Brief reports should  have no more than 1,500 words in the main text plus up to 20 references in the  Vancouver style, and no more than two illustrations (tables or figures, or one  of each).</p>
<p><strong>2.5 Case  Report</strong></p>
<p>A Case Report is a brief communication  presenting collected&nbsp; or single case  reports of clinical or scientific significance. These reports should be concise  and focused on the issue to be discussed. They should address observations of  patients or families that add substantially to the knowledge of the etiology,  pathogenesis, and delineation of the natural history or management of the  condition described.&nbsp; Case Reports should  be 2,000 words or less, with no more than four figures and tables, and no more  than 30 references in the Vancouver style.</p>
<p>Case reports will only  be considered for publication if they bring important contributions to the  basic translational or clinical area, preferentially together with a review of  the literature.</p>
<p><strong>2.6 Letters  to the Editor</strong></p>
<p>Letters to the Editor may be submitted in  response to manuscript that has been published in the Journal. Letters should  be short commentaries related to specific points of agreement or disagreement  with the published manuscript. Letters are not intended for the presentation of  original data unrelated to a published article. Letters should be no longer  than 500 words, with no more than five complete references in the Vancouver  style, and should not include any figures or tables.</p>    </td>
