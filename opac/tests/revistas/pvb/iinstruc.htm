      <p>Papers should contain original research results not yet published or  considered for publication in other journals.</p>
      <p> In spite  that Short Communications are not accepted, there is no minimum limit for the  number of pages, however the article should contain the necessary details about  experiments or methodology used in the study.</p>
      <p> Papers are  the responsibility of the authors, however the right is reserved for the Editor  to suggest or request modifications following peer review.</p>
      <p> Articles  submitted are peer-reviewed and accepted for publication with two favorable  opinions or rejected by two unfavorable opinions.</p>
      <p> Paper  charge of U$ 480.00 is charged, by PayPal invoice sent to the author for  correspondence, when the article is accepted. There is no submission fee and article evaluation.</p>
      <p> The  copyrights of the articles accepted for publication remain with the authors.<br>
  &nbsp; <br>
        Papers should always be submitted  according to the style of the journal (<u><a href="http://www.pvb.com.br">www.pvb.com.br</a></u>):</p>
      <p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Headings. </strong>Papers should be  organized into<strong> </strong>Title, Authors names, ABSTRACT, INDEX TERMS, RESUMO e  TERMOS DE INDEXA&Ccedil;&Atilde;O (Summary and Index Terms in Portuguese, not necessary for  articles in English submitted from foreign countries), INTRODUCTION, MATERIALS  AND METHODS, RESULTS, DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS (or combination of the last two),  Acknowledgements, and REFERENCES. The list of figure legends, the actual Tables  and Figures should be submitted at the end of the article.</p>
      <p> a) <strong>Title</strong> this should be  concise and indicate the content of the paper;</p>
      <p> b) <strong>Authors</strong> should  abbreviate their names (if long) and use them systematically for their  scientific identification and citation. First name should always be extensive  to help access to <em>Curriculum Lattes</em> of CNPq. For example, Paulo Fernando de Vargas Peixoto, uses Paulo V.  Peixoto (inverse, Peixoto P.V.); Franklin Riet-Correa Amaral, uses Franklin  Riet-Correa (inverse, Riet-Correa F.);<br>
          <u>The complete professional  addresses of the authors should be placed on the footnote of the first page,  with the corresponding author&rsquo;s e-mail</u>;</p>
      <p> c) <strong>ABSTRACT </strong>should  contain the same information presented in the Portuguese Summary, but can be more  extensive. Both should be written concisely using the past tense to include  what was done and what were the most important results and conclusions. Layout  and type size should follow the normal format shown in the journal (<u><a href="http://www.pvb.com.br">www.pvb.com.br</a></u>).  In English papers, the title in Portuguese should be given in bold face and  among brackets after the word RESUMO, when this should be the case.</p>
      <p> d) <strong>INTRODUCTION </strong>should be  brief, with specific bibliographical citations, and should explain and justify  the objective of the study;</p>
      <p> e) <strong>MATERIALS AND METHODS</strong> should contain sufficient detail to allow the repetition and verification of  experimental work. Animal experiments should have approval by the local Ethics  Commission;</p>
      <p> f) <strong>RESULTS </strong>should contain the concise presentation of the data obtained. Tables should  avoid superfluous data, presenting, whenever possible, the averages of  repetitions. Complex data is often best expressed with graphs (Figures) rather  than in extensive Tables. Please avoid repetition of data in Tables and Figures;</p>
      <p> g) <strong>DISCUSSION </strong>should draw  attention to the important results and relate them to the literature. Avoid  speculation and references to unpublished data;</p>
      <p> f) <strong>CONCLUSIONS </strong>should  only be based on the results presented in the paper;</p>
      <p> g) <strong>Acknowledgements</strong> should be brief and should not appear in the text or in foot notes;<strong></strong></p>
      <p> h) <strong>REFERENCES </strong>should only include literature mentioned in the  paper and should be ordered alphabetically by the first author&rsquo;s last name.  This name should be followed by those of the other authors (all in lower case),  the year, the title of each publication and the name and detail of volume,  issue and pages of the journal or book. These should be in abbreviated form (or  extensive if there is some doubt) following examples in recent issues of the  journal (<u><a href="http://www.pvb.com.br">www.pvb.com.br</a></u>).</p>
      <p> <strong>2.</strong> <strong>Text</strong></p>
      <p> a) <strong>Layout  and format</strong> should be Cambria and follow the example of the journal&rsquo;s latest  issues (<u>www.pvb.com.br</u>). The text should be written in one column  followed by all the Tables, legends of figures and the actual figures. Figures  (including graphs) should be furnished as Archives separately from the text;  they should be introduced into the text through &ldquo;to Insert&rdquo; of Word, because  copied and inserted images lose the information of the program where they were  generated, what results always in bad quality;</p>
      <p> b) <strong>Style</strong> of the papers  should be clear and concise. This is helped by using short precise sentences  with ample use of correct punctuation and paragraphs. Language should be as far  as possible impersonal and in the past tense. References to footnotes should be  superscript continuous Arabic numbers thrown to the foot of the page. Tables  and Figures should be also referred by numbers. Abstract and Resumo should be  written in only a single paragraph and not contain citations. Scientific names  should be written in <u>extensive form</u> when they appear for the first time  in each chapter.</p>
      <p> c) <strong>Acronyms and abbreviations</strong> for  the names of institutions should be put between parentheses and preceded by the  extensive name the first time they are used;</p>
      <p> d) <strong>Literature citations</strong> should be  made by the system &ldquo;author and year&rdquo;. Two authors&rsquo; papers should be mentioned  by the names of both, and papers of three or more authors by the name of the  first followed by &ldquo;et al.&rdquo; and the year; if two articles cannot be  distinguished by those elements, differentiation will be made through the  insertion of small letters (a,b,c) immediately after the years. <u>Articles not  consulted by the author(s) in the complete original form should be  differentiated by mentioning at the end of the respective reference:  &ldquo;(Abstract)&rdquo; or &ldquo;(Apud So-and-so and the year)&rdquo;; the reference of the article  which served as source, should be included in the list only once.</u><strong> </strong>Citation  of personal communications and not yet published articles in the text is done  only giving Name and Year, and in the list of References additionally is given  the author&rsquo;s Institution in brakes. In the citation of papers within brakes,  commas are not used between the author&rsquo;s name and the year, nor semicolon after  the year; the separation between the papers is made by commas, as for example: (Priester &amp; Haves 1974, Lemos et al. 2004,  Krametter-Froetcher et al. 2007);</p>
      <p> e) the list  of References with names of the authors written in high and low box, and  scientific names in italic, should be in accordance with the pattern adopted in  the last issue of the journal, inclusively the order of their elements. </p>
      <p><strong>3. Figures </strong>(photos, graphs, drawings or maps) should  be preferably submitted in their original form by electronic means; when  photographs were obtained with a digital camera (with extension &ldquo;jpg&rdquo;), <u>the  archives should be sent without treatment or alterations.</u> The graphics  must be produced in 2D, with columns in white, gray and black, bottomless and  without lines. The key  of the adopted convention should be included in the area of the Figure; titles above  the illustration should be avoided. </p>
      <p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Legends of the Figures</strong> should  contain enough information for these to be comprehensible, and will be  presented at the end of the submitted paper. </p>
      <strong>5.  Tables should be explanatory for themselves and put at the end of the text. </strong>Each  one should have its complete title on bold and the heading should be between  two long lines, one above and the other below. <u>There are no vertical lines and&nbsp; no grey bottom</u>. The call signs should be  alphabetical, beginning preferably with &ldquo;a&rdquo; in each Table; the notes should be  thrown directly below the respective Table, from which they should be separated  by a short line, on the left.</td>
