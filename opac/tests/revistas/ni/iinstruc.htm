    <td width="70%"><p><strong>Neotropical  Ichthyology </strong>is the official journal of the  Sociedade Brasileira de Ictiologia (SBI). It is an international peer-reviewed  Open Access periodical that publishes original articles and reviews on  Neotropical freshwater and marine fishes. It constitutes an International Forum  to disclose and discuss results of original research on the diversity of  marine, estuarine and freshwater Neotropical fishes. <u>We give priority to  articles on native species in their original basins. Articles focusing on  aquaculture should be submitted to journals focusing on Animal Science</u>.</p>
    <p>Submitted manuscripts must represent original research  and provide clear theoretical foundations, describe the objectives and/or  hypotheses under consideration, and employ sampling and analytical designs  consistent with the proposal. Descriptive original works of high quality and  relevance will be considered for publication. <u>Casual  observations, scientific notes or descriptive studies not associated with  relevant theoretical issues will not be considered.</u></p></td>

Manuscripts  must be submitted as digital files at <a href="http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/ni-scielo" target="_blank">http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/ni-scielo</a>. The Editor-in-Chief will screen each manuscript submitted to <strong>Neotropical Ichthyology</strong> verifying  whether it is within the journal’s scope, presents original research and  follows the instructions of the journal to authors. After passing through the  initial screening, articles will be assigned to a Section Editor, who will  assign an Associate Editor and start the single blind review process. The  journal is open for submissions to all researchers on Neotropical ichthyofauna. </p>
      <p>        With each new <em>manuscript</em> submission, <em>authors</em> must include a <strong>cover</strong> <strong>letter</strong> stating  that the article constitutes original research and is not being submitted to  other journals. Your letter should also explain to editors <u>why your article should be published, highlight the  strengths of your research and outline the recommendations that can be drawn  from your work</u>. In multi-authored papers, the author responsible for submission  must declare in the cover letter that all coauthors are aware of and agree with  the submission. To that end, please ensure that all your coauthors have read  and approved the final version.</p>
      <p>The mailing addresses and valid e-mail addresses for all authors must be  entered in the appropriate forms during manuscript submission. We strongly  encourage you to register in <a href="http://orcid.org/">http://orcid.org/</a>, ask your coauthors to do  the same and provide ORCID numbers for all authors during submission. At  least the ORCID of the corresponding author is <u>mandatory</u>. Do  not translate Institution names. During the submission, indicate at least five  possible reviewers, providing name, institution, country, and valid e-mail  addresses. You may also indicate your opposition to particular reviewers or  conflicts of interests, if applicable.</p>
    <p>Please, read carefully and follow all applicable  rules prior to submission. <u>Manuscripts that do not meet the journal  formatting requirements, lack required files, or are written in poor English will  be returned to authors without review</u>. </p>
    <p><strong>Costs</strong></p>
    <p>      Paper charges will be billed to the corresponding  author upon initial distribution of page proofs with costs of R$400 reais for  articles of up to 20 printed pages, adding R$5 reais for each page added. For  authors from outside Brazil the values will be converted to US dollars based on  the official quotation of the budget day.</p>
    <p>      All charges are  waived when one or more authors are <u>current</u> SBI members (with  the membership fee of the current year paid) or when  the paper has been invited through the system.  Contact the SBI Secretary (<a href="http://www.sbi.bio.br/en/membership">http://www.sbi.bio.br/en/membership</a>)  for membership rates and payment procedures.</p></td>

      <p>Do not duplicate information among the text, figures and tables. Submit  only figures and tables that are strictly necessary. Supplementary files such  as appendices, and videos should be uploaded already formatted, as pdf or video  files. They will be available <u>only</u> in the online version.</p>
      <p>        For taxonomic papers, please also refer to: <strong><em>Neotropical  Ichthyology </em>taxonomic style below</strong>.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Licensing</strong> </p>
Until  2015, Neotropical Ichthyology published under a Creative Commons BY-NC license (Attribution-Non  commercial). In 2015 the journal changed to the more permissive Creative Common  BY license (Attribution). Articles accepted for publication become property of the  journal.
<p align="center"><strong>Formatting rules</strong></p>
<p align="center">Please, be sure you have carefully read <u>all</u> the items below </p>
      <p><strong>FILE AND PAGE SETUP  </strong>Manuscript files must be in the DOC, DOCX or RTF  formats. Do not lock or protect the file. Formats such as XLS, XLSX or PDF will  NOT be accepted.<strong></strong></p>
      <p>        The document file <u>cannot</u> include headers,  footers, or footnotes (except page number). If your manuscript, figures or  tables contain footnotes, move the information into the main text, captions or  the reference list, depending on the content. Do not format text in multiple  columns. Although no page limit is imposed, manuscripts should always be as  concise as possible.</p>
      <p> Text should be aligned to the left (except if  otherwise mentioned), not fully justified, not indented by tab or space and not  underlined. Do not hyphenate words at line breaks (though hyphens can be used  in compound constructions, such as dorsal-fin rays, as appropriate). <strong></strong></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All text must be Times New Roman font size 12, with  1.5 line spacing. Do <u>not</u> number lines. The font &ldquo;symbol&rdquo; can be used to  represent the following characters: </font>&#x3C7; &#956; &#952; &#969; &#949; &#961; &#964; &#936; &#965; &#953; &#959; &#960; &#945;  &#963; &#948; &#934; &#947; &#951; &#966; &#954; &#955; &#8715; &#982; &#946; &#957; &#8773; &#920; &#937; &#931; &#916; &#934;<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
size="2">. Spell out numbers from one to nine, except those  that refer to numerical values, scale counts, and when referencing figures and  tables. Also, spell out numbers that begin a sentence.</font></p>
      <p>        Abbreviations used in the text must be listed under  Material and Methods; except for those in common use (<em>e.g.</em>, min, km, mm, kg, m, sec, h, ml, L, g). For measurements, use  the metric system. Never use n- or m-dashes anywhere in the manuscript; always  use hyphens instead.<strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>LANGUAGE     </strong>Text  must be submitted in English. If none of the authors are native English  speakers, we recommend that you contract with a professional language-editing  and copyediting services or have the manuscript read by a native English  speaking colleague prior to submission. Authors are free to choose any  certified service, but Neotropical Ichthyology authors receive a discount from  these two companies.</p>

        Avoid clichés, slang, and colloquial words or  expressions such as &ldquo;In the present study&rdquo;. Use the word &ldquo;very&rdquo; sparingly.</p>
      <p><strong>TITLE </strong>New taxa names should <u>not</u> appear in the  title or abstract. <em>E.g., </em>this title  meets the guidelines:A new species of loricariid catfish from the rio  Ribeira de Iguape basin, Brazil (Ostariophysi: Siluriformes). </p>
      <p>Center the title and present it in boldface,  without quotation marks, with sentence-style capitalization, and with subordinate  taxa separated by &ldquo;:&rdquo; <em>e.g.,<strong> </strong></em><strong>…(Siluriformes: Loricariidae)</strong>. Titles must reflect the contents of  the paper and use scientific names rather than vernacular names. Do not provide  taxonomic authorship in the title, but do provide it in the first appearance of  the name in the text. See Nomenclature Section below for further instructions.</p>
      <p><strong>AUTHORS </strong>As the submitting author will be responsible for  completing information at submission, it is mandatory that all authors have  reviewed, discussed, and agreed with the contents of the manuscript and the  order of authorship prior to submission. All co-authors must have contributed  substantially to all article steps. Collectors and contributors of resources  and equipment without substantial intellectual involvement in the project  should be mentioned in the Acknowledgments, but not included as authors.</p>
      <p>        Capitalize only the initial letters of authors&rsquo;  names. Do not abbreviate first name of authors and separate the names of the  last two authors by &ldquo;and&rdquo;. We encourage presenting the full middle names of the  authors, except when the number of authors is more than four. In case of  authors from different institutions, use superscript numerals to identify each  one in regular font (not italics). Superscript numerals can also be used to  identify multiple addresses for each individual author. For Hispanic surnames,  insert a hyphen between the paternal and the maternal surname if the author  wishes to be cited with both (<em>e.g., </em>Javier  Maldonado-Ocampo).</p>
      <p><strong>AUTHORS ADDRESSES </strong>Full mailing addresses and email of <u>all authors</u> must be provided, including institution name, ZIP codes, cities (no comma  between ZIP and city), states and countries. For Brazilian and American states,  use standard abbreviations preceded by comma, and <u>always present the country  name</u> in English. Footnotes should not be used. List emails as part of the  institutional address. When there is more than one author at a given  institution, insert initials of each author name before their respective email  address. Indicate the corresponding author by adding (corresponding author)  after the appropriate email address. Do not use period.</p>

<p><strong>RUNNING HEAD   </strong>Provide a suggested running head of up to 50  characters. It must concisely reflect the content of the article. Do not  include vernacular names or species authorship here.</p>
<p><strong>ABSTRACT   </strong>Abstracts must appear as a single paragraph with  fewer than 200 words in English. Do not include new taxa names, authorship or references. Do not indent. Remember  that this is the first piece of your article that will be viewed by each  potential reader. Include information showing the importance and relevance of  your article to encourage the reader to read your entire paper.</p>
<p> <strong>RESUMO or RESUMEN     </strong>Provide a concise (maximum 200 words) and accurate  Portuguese or Spanish translation of the  English abstract. </p>
<p><strong>KEYWORDS       </strong>Provide up to five capitalized keywords in English,  in alphabetic order and separated by commas. Do not use words already contained  in the title, nor Neotropical (which appears in the name of the journal). If the article provides an identification key, include that as keyword in  the English and translated lists. The order of the Palavras-chave or the  Palabras clave also is arranged alphabetically, but the sequence of the words  might differ from those in English. </p>
<p><strong>TEXT   </strong>The  body of text may employ named heading and subheadings, which cannot be lettered  or numbered. All sections are left justified, except the primary headings,  which should appear <u>centered</u> in small caps and bold font. Employ the  following heading, in the cited order: <strong>Title</strong> (do not include the word Title before the title proper); <strong>Abstract</strong> (in English); <strong>Resumo</strong> or <strong>Resumen</strong> (choose only one, in  Portuguese or Spanish); <strong>Keywords </strong>(in  English and in the same language of the Resumo or Resumen you provided,  literally translated from the English); <strong>Running</strong> <strong>Head</strong>; <strong>Introduction</strong>; <strong>Material and  Methods</strong>; <strong>Results</strong>; <strong>Discussion</strong>; <strong>Acknowledgments</strong> (optional); and <strong>References</strong>. Do not unite Results and Discussion as a unique section  or provide a separate Conclusion section. However, we encourage highlighting  conclusions as the last paragraph(s) of the Discussion. If two heading levels  are used, follow this format:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <strong>Material and  Methods</strong><br>
    <strong>Sampling sites. </strong>Collections were carried out in…<br>
    <strong>Statistical  analyses. </strong>Data were analyzed…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case of listing Examined Material, provide a  list of institutional acronyms in Material and Methods section OR a reference  to a <u>published</u> paper with a list of acronyms in Material and Methods.  Also, reference(s) for species identification and classification used must be  provided.</p>
<p><strong>VOUCHER SPECIMENS     </strong>Voucher specimens of<strong> </strong>all  species examined must be deposited in a recognized scientific research  collection, even in studies focusing on a single well-known species. A list of  catalog numbers of voucher specimen(s) <u>must</u> be furnished in all  manuscripts.</p>
<p><strong>NOMENCLATURE       </strong>Species, genera, and Latin terms (<em>et al., in vitro, in vivo, vs., i.e, e.g.</em>)  must be in italics. Cite scientific names according to the ICZN (<a href="http://iczn.org/iczn/index.jsp">http://iczn.org/iczn/index.jsp</a>).</p>
<p>Authorship should be given at the first reference  to a species or genus. Spelling, valid names and authorship of species must be  checked in the Catalog of Fishes at <a href="http://research.calacademy.org/research/ichthyology/catalog/fishcatmain.asp">http://research.calacademy.org/research/ichthyology/catalog/fishcatmain.asp</a>. Latin  terms presented between the generic and specific names (cf., aff., etc.) are  not in italics (<em>e.g., Hoplias</em> cf. <em>malabaricus</em>).</p>
<p>The genus name must always be fully spelled at its  first appearance, at the beginning of a sentence and at least once in each  figure and table caption(s). After first mention, the first letter of the genus  name followed by the full species name may be used (<em>e.g., H. malabaricus</em>) as long as the abbreviation leaves no possibility  of confusion with another generic name mentioned in the manuscript. In the case  of possible confusion, the abbreviation can include more than the first letter  to allow the differentiation of genera beginning with the same letter.</p>
<p><strong>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  </strong>Acknowledgments are optional but encouraged. If  included, they must be concise and include both first and last names of  persons. Abbreviate institutions, where the full name has been provided in the  Material and Methods. Names of sponsor institutions should be listed in their  original spelling and not translated to English. Collections permit numbers and  approvals of ethics committees can be listed here OR in the Material and  Methods section.</p>
<p><strong>TABLES </strong>Tables must be numbered sequentially in Arabic  numerals according to the order of citation in the text and be cited in the text using the following formats:  Tab. 1, Tabs. 1-2, Tabs. 1, 4. Approximate locations where tables should be  inserted must be indicated in upper case, along the <u>right</u> margin of the  text, as in:</p>
<p> TABLE 1<br>
In table captions, the word Tab., its respective  number and final period after the number should be in bold (<em>e.g., </em><strong>Tab. 1.</strong>...). End the caption in a period. Captions must be  self-explicative. If genus names appear in a caption, spell out the name at  least once.</p>
<p>Tables must be constructed in cells using lines and  columns. Do <u>not</u> format tables with &ldquo;tab&rdquo; or &ldquo;space&rdquo;. Tables should not  contain visible vertical lines or footnotes [contents of footnotes must be  included in the caption].<br>
      List all captions at the end of the manuscript, in  the following format: <em>e.g.</em>,<strong>Tab.  1.</strong> Monthly variation of the gonadosomatic index in <em>Diapoma </em><em>pyrrhopteryx</em>and<em> D.  speculiferum</em>... </p>
<p><strong>FIGURES </strong>Figures must be numbered sequentially in Arabic  numerals according to their order of citation in the text. Cite figures in the  text using the following formats: Fig. 1, Figs. 1-2, Fig. 1a, Figs. 1a-b, Figs.  1a, c. Indicate the approximate locations where figures should be inserted in  upper case, along the <u>right</u> margin of the text, as in:<br>
        <br>
        FIGURE 1 <br>
        In each figure caption, the word Fig., its respective  number and period are in bold (<em>e.g., </em><strong>Fig. 1.</strong>…). End each caption with a  period. Captions must be self-explicative. If genus names appear in a caption,  spell out the name at least once. Do not include symbols in the caption, but  rather replace them with text (<em>e.g., </em>black  triangle) or include a legend in the figure itself.</p>
<p>Indicate figure subsections in lower case and bold  letters in both in the <u>figure</u> and <u>caption</u> (<em>e.g., </em><strong>Fig. 1. </strong>Olfactory  epithelium of representatives of Otophysi. <strong>a</strong>. <em>Cyprinus carpio</em>; <strong>b.</strong> <em>Brycon orbignyanus</em>; <strong>c.</strong> <em>Pimelodus  maculatus</em>; and <strong>d. </strong><em>Sternopygus macrurus</em>. Scale bars = 1  mm). Do not use capital letters, or parentheses after letters.</p>
<p> Cite figures from other articles using the same  formats as figures published in the present article, but do not capitalize them  (<em>e.g., </em>…according to the figs. 2b of  Vari, Harold (2001)…).</p>
<p> Figures cannot be submitted as images inserted in  Word files. Figures must be submitted as high quality individual files. For  b&amp;w figures, they must be saved in TIFF format, gray scale, 8.5 or 17.5 cm  width, 600 dpi. Color figures must be in TIFF format, CMYK, 8.5 or 17.5 cm  width and 300 dpi.</p>
<p>Composed figures must fit either the page (17.5 cm)  or column width (8.5 cm). Text included in graphs and pictures must have a font  size compatible with reductions to page or column width.</p>
<p>Illustrations must include either a scale or  reference to the size of the item in the figure caption. </p>
<p>List all captions at the end of the manuscript, in  the following format: <em>e.g.</em>,<strong>Fig.  1.</strong> Monthly variation of the gonadosomatic index in <em>Diapoma </em><em>pyrrhopteryx</em>and<em> D.  speculiferum</em>...</p>
<p><strong>SUPPLEMENTARY FILES </strong>Upload appendices, videos, datasets and other  complementary materials as supplementary files. Identify these in the text by a  bolded letter <strong>S</strong> followed by  sequential numbers in Arabic numerals.

      <p>Comments  on above:</p>
      <p><strong>Synonymy</strong>          Provide  a complete synonymy listing all validly published names that have been applied  to the genus, including all references in systematic treatments or  identification guides that can help link the present concept of the genus to  past concepts. The senior synonym is usually the correct and valid name. If  applicable, include invalid names and mistakes in identity with suitable  annotation to indicate their nature. For each name listed, include minimally:  the original form of the name; the author and date of publication; reference  and page number; basic information on the genus in the paper cited (modified  from Wiley EO, Lieberman BS. Phylogenetics: theory and practice of Phylogenetic  Systematics. 2nd edition. Hoboken: Wiley-Blackwell; 2011). Provide full  references of all listed sources as part of the References section. If  applicable, discuss the synonymy and cite relevant literature in the Remarks  section.<br>
E.g., Parodon Valenciennes, 1849</p>
      <p>Parodon Valenciennes, in Cuvier, Valenciennes,  1849:50 (original description; type-species by original designation and  monotypy: Parodon suborbitalis Valenciennes). –Günther, 1864:31  (redescription). –Eigenmann, 1912:274 (diagnosis). –Schultz, Miles, 1943:251  (diagnosis in key). –Schultz, 1944:288 (diagnosis in key). –Campos, 1945:440  (diagnosis). –Miles, 1947:132 (diagnosis). –Travassos, 1955:4 (synonymic list).  –Böhlke, 1958:83 (comments). –Ringuelet et al., 1967:180 (diagnosis in key).  –Roberts, 1974b:433 (osteology). –Godoy, 1975:451 (diagnosis in key). –Géry,  1977:202 (diagnosis in key). –Britski et al., 1988:26 (diagnosis in key).<br>
        Nematoparodon Fowler, 1943:226 (original  description; type-species by original designation and monotypy: Parodon  apolinari Myers).</p>
      <p><strong>Type-species</strong>    For  proposed new genera, the original name of the proposed type-species, followed  by author and year of publication (or new species) is sufficient. For  previously proposed generic names, the following additional information is  required (in this order): Nature of type designation (e. g., original  designation, monotypy, absolute tautonymy, etc). Whether the type-species was  not designated in the original publication, the author, year and page of the  subsequent designation should be cited (e. g., Type by subsequent designation  by Jordan, 1919: 45). </p>
      <p><strong>Diagnosis</strong>            Diagnosis  should NOT be written in telegraphic style (for purposes of clarity). A generic  diagnosis should preferably list the unique synapomorphies of the genus,  followed by homoplastic derived characters and/or other useful distinguishing  characteristics. </p>
      <p><strong>Description</strong>        In  telegraphic style (i.e., no verbs nor articles).</p>
      <p><strong>Etymology</strong>          For  new names, state the gender, even though it may be obvious from the  construction. Do not give an etymology for preexisting names. If it is  necessary to discuss the etymology of an old name (for example, to justify an  interpretation of its gender), include that in the Remarks section. </p>
      <p><strong>Key to species</strong>  If  a key for identification of species is provided and it was not mentioned in the  title, add &ldquo;dichotomous key&rdquo; or &ldquo;identification key&rdquo; as a keyword.</p>

For each name listed, include minimally:  the original form of the name; the author and date of publication; reference  and page number; country or basin and basic information on the species in the  paper cited (modified from Wiley EO, Lieberman BS. Phylogenetics: theory and  practice of Phylogenetic Systematics. 2nd edition. Hoboken: Wiley-Blackwell;  2011). Provide full references of all listed sources as part of the References  section. If applicable, discuss the synonymy and cite relevant literature in  the Remarks section.<br>

      <p><strong>Types   </strong>For  new species, list types separately from other comparative material examined.  Include full collection data, in the following order: <br>
        Museum  acronym and catalog number, number of specimens (except for holotype), size  range separated by hyphen, number and size range of measured specimens, if  different (in parentheses along with size range) locality (country,  state, municipality, locality, basin, coordinates), date of collection [in dd,  Month (3 letter abbreviation) and yyyy], and collector(s)  [<em>e.g.</em>, Paratypes. LIRP 5640, 25, 38.5-90.3 mm SL (12, 75.0-90.3 mm  SL), Brazil, São Paulo, Município de Marapoama, rio Tietê basin, ribeirão  Cubatão at road between Marapoama and Elisiário, 21º11'35&quot;S  49º07'22&quot;W, 10 Feb 2003, A. L. A. Melo].<br>
        Group paratypes by country or basin, in  alphanumeric order of museum acronym and catalog numbers inside each group.<br>
  <strong>Note:</strong> Except in cases where no actively-curated scientific research collection  exists, Holotypes <u>must</u> be deposited in collections in the country of  origin of the species. When a species occurs in multiple countries, the  holotype must be deposited in the country of the type-locality, with paratypes  distributed among countries in which the species occurs. Even in cases of  species endemic to one country, we encourage dissemination of paratypes. <br>
  </p>
      <p><strong>Diagnosis            </strong>Do NOT write the diagnosis in telegraphic style  (for purposes of clarity). A species diagnosis is typically a paragraph  constructed of full sentences that list the most important traits that allow  the reader to unequivocally identify the species. Ideally, the diagnosis  includes one or more features that are unique to the species, preferably  autapomorphic characters. If unique features were not discovered, the next best  option is a differential diagnosis, within which a series of direct comparisons  are made among species and the alternative character states specified by  contrasts are stated explicitly (using &quot;<em>vs.</em>&quot; followed by the condition found in the species, or group of  species, being compared, for each diagnostic feature). Diagnoses that consist  only of a combination of characters (<em>i.e.</em>,  traits listed sequentially which, when considered together, distinguish the  species from congeners) in many cases fail to make a convincing case that the  species warrants recognition, mostly because too little information is offered  in the way of direct comparisons with congeners. They also make it very  difficult for readers not already expert in the systematics of the group in  question to recognize the new species. For that reason, this form of diagnosis  should be avoided. In the event of listing species in the diagnosis without  associated comparative material, please formally cite their original  descriptions and provide full references.<br>
        </p>
      <p><strong>Description      </strong>Write  the description section in telegraphic style (<em>i.e.</em>, without verbs and articles). Treat bilaterally paired  structures in the singular (<em>e.g.</em>,  pelvic fin short, not pelvic fins short). Compound adjectives that include a  noun should be connected by a hyphen (<em>e.g.</em>,  pectoral-fin spine, NOT pectoral fin spine). Fin-ray formulae should be  reported with unbranched rays in lower case Roman numerals, spines in upper  case Roman, and branched rays in Arabic numerals. Transitions between different  types of rays should be indicated by a comma (,) and not a plus sign (+), or  dash (-) (<em>e.g.</em>, iii,7 or II,9. Not  iii-7 or iii+7; no spaces should be inserted after the comma). We treat the  catfish spinelet as a spine, so dorsal fin counts that include a spinelet  should be reported as II,6 (or whatever the branched ray count is).<br>
        Do not include  space between numerals and % (<em>e.g., </em>25%,  not 25 %).<br>
        </p>
      <p><strong>Coloration            </strong>Writ this section in telegraphic style (<em>i.e.</em>, without verbs or articles). This  section may be divided into Coloration in alcohol and Coloration in life. <br>
        </p>
      <p><strong>Geographic distribution          </strong>Geographic  descriptors must NOT be translated and should be capitalized or not according  to the standard usage in the language in question. English usage typically uses  capitals (<em>e.g.</em>, Amazon River, Parana  River, Paraguay River) while Portuguese and Spanish do not (<em>e.g</em>,rio Solimões, río Magdalena, rio Paraná, río Parana, río Paraguay, rio  Paraguai). When referring to a municipality or geopolitical region that  includes the names of a water body, capitalize the entity as a proper noun in  all languages (<em>e.g.</em>, Municipality of  Arroio dos Ratos, State of Rio Grande do Sul). <br>
        </p>
      <p><strong>Etymology           </strong>For new names, state the usage (adjective, noun,  patronym, etc.), even though it may be obvious from the construction. For more  information, see article 31 of the online International Code of Zoological  Nomenclature (<a href="http://www.iczn.org/iczn/index.jsp">http://www.iczn.org/iczn/index.jsp</a>). Do not provide an etymology for preexisting  names, unless the etymology is necessary to justify the spelling. In such  cases, include this information in the Remarks Section and not as a separate  heading. <br>
        </p>
      <p><strong>Conservation  status     </strong>Please consider providing the conservation status,  at least for new species, based on the IUCN criteria and categories [<em>e.g., </em><strong>Conservation status.</strong> According to the International Union for  Conservation of Nature (IUCN) categories and criteria (IUCN Standards and  Petitions Subcommittee, 2016), <em>Genus  species</em> can be classified as Category (category abbreviation)]. In such  case, the reference to be provided is: International Union  for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Standards and Petitions Subcommittee.  Guidelines for using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria. Version 12  [Internet]. 2016 [updated 2016 Feb]. Available from:  http://cmsdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/RedListGuidelines.pdf <br>
        </p>
      <p><strong>Material examined       </strong>Provide  only taxa, museum acronym, catalog number, number of specimens and size range.<br>
        Indicate  any types by: (Holo- Syn-, etc.) type of <em>Genus  species</em> Author, date. For lectotypes or neotypes, also cite the source of  designation (<em>e.g.</em>, USNM 123456,  lectotype of <em>Genus species</em> Author,  date, designated by Author (year: pp) [or designated herein]).<br>
        Specimen lots should be arranged taxonomically, and  then by country or basin (in bold), in alphanumeric order of museum acronym and  catalog numbers inside each group proposed (<em>e.g.</em>, <em>Auchenipterichthys  coracoideus</em>: <strong>Peru</strong>: CAS 220574, 2, 104.0-107.0 mm SL, syntypes of <em>Trachycorystes  coracoideus </em>Eigenmann, Allen, 1942). Deviation from this order is  permissible only if an alternate arrangement shortens the text. If another  arrangement is chosen, its use must be explained and justified in the Material  and Methods section. <br>
        List material of  non-focal species as <strong>Comparative material  examined</strong>, using the same rules of arrangement stated above. </p>
      <p><strong>Large taxonomic revisions  and reviews</strong></p>
      <p>Before  presenting the taxonomic accounts, provide a table at the beginning, cited  early, that lists all the species included in the revision that are new and those  that are being redescribed. Taxon accounts can be arranged in two ways: presenting  the new species descriptions first (in alphabetic order) and then the  redescribed species (in alphabetic order), OR reporting all the species in  alphabetic order without separating new and redescribed ones. In either case, mentioning  the words <strong>new genus</strong> or <strong>new species</strong> after the name of each new taxon  presented, preceded by a comma. The chosen order of presentation should focus  on brevity and comprehensibility</p>
