      <p>The journal  Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciências  from 2012 onwards only considers online submissions. Once  you have prepared your manuscript according to the instructions below, please  visit the new, improved online submission website at <a href="https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/aabc-scielo" target="_blank">https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/aabc-scielo</a>.
    Please read these instructions carefully and follow  them strictly. In this way you will help ensure that the review and publication  of your paper are as efficient and quick as possible. The editors reserve the  right to return manuscripts that are not in accordance with these instructions.  Papers must be clearly and concisely written in English.</td>

      <p>All submitted manuscripts should contain original research not  previously published and not under consideration for publication elsewhere. The  primary criterion for acceptance is scientific quality. Papers should avoid  excessive use of abbreviations or jargon, and should be intelligible to as wide  an audience as possible. Particular attention should be paid to the Abstract,  Introduction, and Discussion sections, which should clearly draw attention to  the novelty and significance of the data reported. Failure to do this may  result in delays in publication or rejection of the paper.
      Articles accepted for publication become property of the journal.
      <p>Texts can be published as a review,  a full paper (article) or as a short communication. Issues appear in March,  June, September and December.</p>
      <p>          <strong><u>Types of Papers</u></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Reviews</strong><br>
        Reviews are published by invitation only. A proposal for a Review must be sent to the Editorial  Office (<a href="mailto:aabc@abc.org.br">aabc@abc.org.br</a>), which will proceed  accordingly.</p>
      <p><strong>Articles</strong><br>
      Whenever possible the articles should be subdivided into the following  parts: 1. Front Page; 2. Abstract (written on a separate page, 200 words or  less, no abbreviations); 3. Introduction; 4. Materials and Methods; 5. Results;  6. Discussion; 7. Acknowledgments, if applicable; 8. References. Articles from  some areas such as Mathematical Sciences should follow their usual format. In  some cases it may be advisable to omit part (4) and to merge parts (5) and  (6). Whenever applicable,  the Materials and Methods section  should indicate the Ethics Committee that evaluated the procedures for human  studies or the norms followed for the maintenance and experimental treatments  of animals.</p>
      <p><strong>Short communications</strong><br>
      Short communications aim to  report on research which has progressed to the stage when it is considered that  results should be divulged rapidly to other workers in the field. A short  communication should also have an Abstract and should not exceed 1,500 words.  Tables and Figures may be included but the text length should be proportionally  reduced. Manuscripts submitted as  articles but found  to fit these specifications will be published as short communications  upon the author’s agreement.</p>
      <p>After  the first screening, the articles will be evaluated by at least two reviewers,  them being from educational and/or national and international research institutions,  with proven scientific production. After due corrections and possible  suggestions, the paper may be accepted or rejected, considering the reviews  received.</p>
      <p>We use the integrated Crossref Similarity Check program  to detect plagiarism.</p>
      <p>There are no APC and submission charges in the  AABC.</p>

      <p>All parts of the manuscript should be  double-spaced throughout. After acceptance, no changes will be made in the  manuscript so that proofs require only corrections of typographical errors. The  authors should send their manuscript in electronic version only.
      <p><strong>Length  of manuscript</strong><br>
        While papers may be of any length required  for the concise presentation and discussion of the data, succinct and carefully  prepared papers are favored both in terms of impact as well as in readability.</p>
      <p><strong>Tables  and Illustrations</strong><br>
        Only high-quality illustrations will be  accepted. All illustrations will be considered figures including drawings,  graphs, maps, photographs as well as tables with more than 12 columns or more  than 24 lines. Their tentative placement in the text should be indicated. The  AABC do not charge the first 5 figures in black and white or scale of gray.  Should the authors want colored figures in the hard copy, a cost may be  generated for each one of them, as well as for each figure in black and white  or scale of gray beyond 5. Figures that are published in colors only in the  online version do not generate additional costs.</p>
      <p><strong>Digitalized  figures</strong><br>
        Figures should be  sent according to the following specifications: 1. Drawings and illustrations  should be in format EPS (PostScript) or AI (Adobe Illustrator) and never be  inserted in text; 2. Images or figures in grayscale should be in format TIF and  never be inserted in text; 3. Each figure should be saved in a separate file;  4. Figures should be submitted at high quality (minimum resolution of 300dpi)  at the size they are to appear in the journal, i.e., 8 cm (one column) or 16.5 cm (two  columns) wide, with maximal height for each <strong>figure and respective legend smaller than or equal to 22 cm. </strong>The  legends to the figures should be sent double-spaced on a separate page. Each  linear dimension of the smallest characters and symbols should not be less than  2 mm after reduction; 5. Manuscripts on Mathematics, Physics or Chemistry may  be typesetted in                                                                       ,       or      . The TEX, PDF and  BIB files should be sent, and EPS files if there are any figures; 6.  Manuscripts without mathematical formulae may be sent in RTF, DOC or DOCX.</p>
      <p><strong>Front  page</strong><br>
        The front page of the manuscript should present the following items: 1.  Title of the article (the  title should be short, specific, and informative); 2. Full name(s) of the  author(s); 3. Full professional address of each author (institution, street,  number, zip code, city/county, state if applicable, country, etc.); 4. Key  words (four to six in alphabetical order); 5. Running title (up to 50  characters); 6. Academy Section (one out of our 10 areas) to which the content  of the work belongs; 7. Name and e-mail address of the author to whom all  correspondence and proofs should be provided. Should any of these requirements not be met, we may  unsubmit your paper and ask for corrections.</p>
      <p><strong>Acknowledgments</strong><br>
        These should be included at the end of the text.  Personal acknowledgments should precede those of institutions or agencies.  Footnotes should be avoided; when necessary they must be numbered.  Acknowledgments to grants and scholarships, and of indebtedness to colleagues  as well as mention to the origin of an article (e.g. thesis) should be added to  the Acknowledgments section.</p>
      <p><strong>Abbreviations</strong><br>
        Abbreviations should be defined at their first  occurrence in the text, except for official, standard abbreviations. Units and  their symbols should conform to those approved by the ABNT or by the Bureau  International des Poids et Mesures (SI).</p>
      <p><strong>References</strong><br>
        Authors are responsible for the  accuracy of the References. Published articles and those in press may be  included. Personal communications (Smith, personal communication) must be  authorized in writing by those involved. References to thesis, meeting  abstracts (not published in indexed journals) and manuscripts in preparation or  submitted, but not yet accepted, should be cited in the text as (Smith et al.,  unpublished data) and should NOT be included in the list of references.</p>
      <p>The references should be cited in the text as, for example, ‘Smith 2004’,  ‘Smith and Wesson 2005’ or, for three or more authors, ‘Smith et al. 2006’. Two  or more papers by the same author(s) in the same year should be distinguished  by letters, e.g. ‘Smith 2004a’, ‘Smith 2004b’ etc. Letters should also  distinguish papers by three or more authors with identical first author and  year of publication. References should be  listed according to  the alphabetical order of the first author, always in the order SURNAME  XY in which X and Y are initials. If there are more than ten authors, use et  al. after the first author. References must contain the title of the article.  Names of the journals should be abbreviated without dots or commas. For the correct abbreviations,  refer to lists of the major databases in which the journal is indexed or  consult the World List of Scientific Periodicals. The abbreviation to be used  for the Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciências is An Acad Bras Cienc. The  following examples are to be considered as guidelines for the References.</p>
