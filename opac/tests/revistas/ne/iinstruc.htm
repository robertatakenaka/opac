    <td WIDTH="70%"> 
      <p>Articles (text and tables) must be submitted as MS Word 2003 or other 
        recent word processor. Set paper size in A4 and 2.5 cm margins; number 
        all lines and pages in the document. Use font Times New Roman 12 and double 
        spaces. </p>
      <p><b>Front page. </b>Justify the complete name and the regular and electronic 
        mail addresses of corresponding author on the upper right of the page. 
        Center-justify the title using capital initials (except for prepositions 
        and articles). Scientific names in the title should be followed by the 
        author's name (do not mention the year) and, by the order and family names 
        in parentheses. Author names should be left-justified below the title 
        using small capital letters; only initials of the first and midle names 
        of authors are provided folowed by the last names in full. Names of different 
        authors are separated by commas; do not use &quot;and' or &quot;&amp;'. 
        Skip one line and list each authors' affiliation identified by call numbers 
        whenever more than one address is listed. Skip another line and provide 
        a urring title, no longer than 60 letters.
      <p><b>Page 2. Abstract. </b>The abstract should be easy to understand and 
        not require reference to the body of the article. Only very important 
        results should be presented in the abstract; it must not contain any abbreviations 
        or statistical details. Type ABSTRACT followed by a hyphen and the text. 
        The abstract should be one-paragraph long and not exceed 250 words. Skip 
        one line and type Keywords. Type three to five keywords separated by commas; 
        these words cannot be in the title.
      <p><b>Main Text </b> 
      <p><b>Introduction.</b> Left-justify the subtitle &quot;Introductionin bold. 
        The introduction must clearly contextualize the research problem and state 
        the scientific hypothesis being tested, as well as the research objectives. 
      <p><b>Material and Methods</b> must provide enough information for the research 
        to be replicated. Please include the statistical design and, if necessary, 
        the name of the program used for analysis. 
      <p><b>Results and Discussion</b> can be grouped or kept in separate sections. 
        In Results, mean values must be followed by the mean standard error and 
        the number of observations. Use one decimal for mean values and two decimals 
        for standard errors. Conclusions must be stated at the end of discussion. 
      <p><b>Acknowledgments</b> should be concise and contain the recognition 
        to people first, and then to affiliations and/or sponsors.
      <p> 
      <p><b>References. </b>Under the title,<b> </b>type the references, in alphabetical 
        order, one per paragraph, with no space between them. The authors last 
        names are typed in full, followed by capital initials. Use a comma to 
        separate the names of authors. Add the reference year after the authors' 
        names, between parentheses. Abbreviate the titles of the bibliographical 
        sources, starting with capital letters. Use journal abbreviations according 
        to the BIOSIS Serial Sources (<a href="http://www.library.uiuc.edu/biotech/">www.library.uiuc.edu/biotech/<br>
        j-abbrev.html#abbrev</a> or <a href="http://www.library.uq.edu.au/faqs/endnote/biosciences.txt" target="_blank">http://www.library.uq.edu.au/faqs/endnote/biosciences.txt</a>). 
        Abbreviation of Brazilian journal titles must follow each journal requirements. 
        Please avoid citations of dissertations, theses, and extension materials. 
        Do not cite restricted-circulation materials (such as institutional documentation 
        and research reports), monographs, partial research reports, or abstracts 
        of papers presented at scientific meetings.

      <p><b>Tables.</b> Tables should be placed separately, one per page, after 
        the References section. Please number tables consecutively with Arabic 
        numbers at the same order they are referred in the text. Footnotes must 
        have call numbers. Use the word &quot;Table&quot; in full in the text 
        (example: Table 1). Example of a table title: 
      <p>Table 1 Mean (&#177; SE) duration and survivorship of larvae and pupae 
        of <i>Cirrospilus neotropicus</i> reared on <i>Phyllocnistis</i> <i>citrella</i> 
        larvae. Temp.: 25 &#177; 1&#186;C, RH: 70% and photophase: 14h. 
      <p><b>Figures. </b>Insert the list of figures after the tables. Use the 
        abbreviation &quot;Fig&quot; in the titles and in the text (such as Fig 
        3). Figures must be in jpg, gif or eps format. Use original or high resolution 
        figures. Whenever possible, graphics should be sent in Excell. Example 
        of a figure title: 
      <p>Fig 1 Populacional distribution of <i>Mahanarva fimbriolata</i> in S&atilde;o 
        Carlos, SP, 2002 to 2005. 
      <p><b>In-text citations </b> 
      <p><b>Scientific names. </b>Write the scientific names in full, followed 
        by the author's name (for insect and mite species), when they are first 
        mentioned in the Abstract and in the body of the text. E.g.: <i>Spodoptera 
        frugiperda</i> (J E Smith). Use the abbreviated generic name (E.g.: <i>S</i>. 
        <i>frugiperda</i>) in the rest of the paper, except in tables and figures, 
        where name should be in full. 
      <p> <b>References. </b>Write the author's last name with capital initial, 
        followed by the year of publication (for example, Martins 1998). More 
        than one publication are chronologically ordered, separated with comas 
        (for example: Martins 1998, Garcia 2005, 2008, Wilson 2010). Use &quot;&amp;&quot; 
        for two authors (such as Martins &amp; Gomes 2009). Please use italicized 
        &quot;<i>et al</i>&quot; for more than two authors (as in Duarte <i>et 
        al</i> 2010). 
      <p><b>Scientific Notes</b> 
      <p>Manuscripts that report trophic occurrences, interactions or new methods 
        for the study of insects and mites can be submitted. But records of species 
        or host associations to new localities in geographical regions that they 
        are already known are no longer accepted for publication. Records of species 
        or associations known to a geographical region may be considered only 
        if including new ecological zones. Distribution records must not be based 
        on political borders, but on ecosystems. Manuscript requirements are the 
        same as for scientific articles. However, Introduction, Material and Methods, 
        and Results and Discussion are written without subtitles. The abstract 
        must be shorter than 100 words and the text no longer than 1,000 words. 
        Figures or tables can be included if highly necessary, but not exceed 
        the limit of two figures or tables per note.
      <p>Scientific notes that register a new pest introduced in Brazil need to 
        follow the regulations of Portaria Interministerial 290, of 15/April/1996, 
        available in <a href="http://extranet.agricultura.gov.br/sislegis-consulta/consultarLegislacao.do?operacao=visualizar&id=883" target="_blank">http://extranet.agricultura.gov.br/sislegis-consulta/consultarLegislacao.do?operacao=visualizar&amp;id=883</a>.
