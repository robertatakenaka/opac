    <td width="70%"><p>Manuscripts are accepted in the following languages:  Portuguese, Spanish and English.</p>
      <p> The manuscript of an original research should  follow the structure known as IMRD: Introduction, Methods, Results and  Discussion (<a href="#Ponto1">Text Structure</a>).  Manuscripts based on qualitative research may have other formats, assimilating  Results and Discussion in a single section and Final Remarks/Conclusions. Other  categories of manuscripts (reviews, commentaries etc.) follow appropriate  specific text formats.</p>
      <p> Studies should be presented so that any  interested researcher may be able to reproduce the results. Therefore, we  encourage the use of the following <strong><u>recommendations</u></strong>, according to the category of  the submitted manuscript:</p>

      <p>Details of the items required for submission  of the manuscript are described according to the <a href="#Ponto2">article  category.</a></p>
      <p><strong>Article categories</strong></p>
      <p><strong>a) Original Articles</strong> </p>
      <p>Include observational studies, experimental  or quasi-experimental studies, programs evaluation, cost-effectiveness  analysis, decision analysis and studies on evaluation of diagnostic tests  performance for population screening. Each article should contain clear  objectives and hypotheses, design and methods used, results, discussion and  conclusions.</p>
      <p> Also include theoretical essays (critical and  formulation of relevant theoretical knowledge) and articles dedicated to the  presentation and discussion of methodological aspects and techniques used in  public health research. In this case, the text should be divided into topics to  guide the reader, regarding the essential elements of the argument being  developed.</p>
      <p><strong>Measuring instruments in population surveys</strong><br>
        Manuscripts dealing with measuring  instruments may include aspects of the development, evaluation and  cross-cultural adaptation for use in population studies, excluding those of  clinical application, which do not fall within the scope of RSP.</p>
      <p> To the manuscripts exploring measuring instruments,  we recommend the presentation of a detailed assessment of the construct being  evaluated, including possible intensity gradient and sub-dimensions. The development  of a new instrument should be supported by the existing literature, explicitly  identifying the failure of previous proposals and justifying the need for a new  instrument.</p>
      <p> The proposal, selection and preparation of the  items should be detailed, as well as the employment of strategies to adapt them  to the construct, including the use of qualitative research techniques (in-depth  interviews, focus groups etc.), meetings with expert panels, among others. The  route taken in defining the way items are measured and pre-tests conducted with  its preliminary settings, should be described in the text. The evaluation of  face, content, criterion, construct and/or dimensional validity should be  presented in detail.</p>
      <p> Instrument reliability analysis should also  be presented and discussed, including internal consistency measures,  test-retest reliability and/or inter-observer agreement. Authors should explain  the selection process of the final instrument and place it in a critical and  comparative perspective with other instruments used to measure the same  construct or similar constructs.</p>
      <p> Manuscripts on <strong>cross-cultural adaptation</strong> of measuring instruments, should meet, in  general, all the recommendations mentioned above, and should also clarify the  guiding theoretical model used in the process. Authors should also justify the  choice of an instrument for adaptation to a specific sociocultural context,  based on thorough literature review. Finally, authors should explicitly state  which steps of the theoretical model were used, and how they were employed, for  the adaptation of the work submitted for publication.<br>
        Note: The measurement instrument should be  included as an annex of the submitted articles.</p>

      <p> The public confidence in  the peer review process and the credibility of published articles depend, in  part, on how conflicts of interest are managed during the writing, peer review  and decision-making by the editors.<br>
        Conflicts of interest may  arise when authors, reviewers and editors have interests that, clear or not,  may influence the development or the evaluation of the manuscripts. Conflict of  interest can be personal, commercial, political, academic or financial in  nature.
      <p> When authors submit a  manuscript, they are responsible for recognizing and disclosing financial  conflicts or others, which may have influenced their work. Authors must  acknowledge all financial support for the work and other financial or personal  connections linked to the research. The reporter should disclose to the editors  any conflicts of interest that could bias their opinions of the manuscript,  and, when appropriate, should declare himself/herself unqualified to review it.

      All graphical and tabular elements displayed should  be identified as figures or tables, and sequentially numbered, starting with  one, and not as charts, graphs etc.</p>
      <p><strong>Abstract</strong> <br>
        Abstracts are published in Portuguese,  Spanish and English. For the registration of the manuscript, two abstracts must  be presented, one in the original language of the manuscript and the other in  English (or Portuguese, if the manuscript submitted is in English). The  specifications for the type of abstract are described in each of the <strong><u>article categories</u></strong>. As a general rule, the  abstract should include: the objective of the study, the main methodological  procedures (study population, place and year, observational and analytical  methods), main results and the conclusions.</p>
      <p><strong>Text  structure</strong><br>
          <em>Introduction </em>&ndash; Should be short, describing the context and  the justification of the study, supported by references relevant to the  objective of the manuscript, which must be made clear at the end of this part. No  results or conclusions of the study being presented should be mentioned.</p>
      <p><em>Methods </em>&ndash; The procedures adopted should be clearly  described; as well as the variables analyzed, with its respective definitions  when necessary and the hypothesis to be tested. Descriptions should include population  and the sample, measuring instruments, with the presentation, if possible, of  the validity measures; and contain information on the collection and processing  of the data. Due reference to the methods and techniques employed, including  statistical methods should be included; new or substantially modified methods  should be described, explaining the reasons for their use and citing their limitations.  The research ethical criteria must be met. The authors should state that the  research was conducted within the ethical standards and approved by the ethics  committee.</p>
      <p><em>Results </em>&ndash; Should be presented in a logical sequence,  starting with the description of the most important data. Tables and figures  should be restricted to those necessary for argument and description of the  data in the text should be restricted to the most important. Graphs should be  used to highlight the most relevant results and summarize complex  relationships. Data in graphs and tables should not be duplicated or repeated  in the text. Numerical results should specify the statistical methods used in  the analysis. Extra or additional material and technical details may be  disclosed in the electronic version of the article.</p>
      <p><em>Discussion </em>- From the data obtained and the results  achieved, new and important aspects observed should be interpreted in the light  of the scientific literature and existing theories in the field. Arguments and  evidence based on personal communication or disclosed in restricted documents  cannot serve to support the author's arguments. Both the limitations of the  work and its implications for future research should be clarified. Include only  assumptions and generalizations based on work data. The results should bring up  the rear of this part, reiterating the article&rsquo;s objective.</p>
      <p><strong>References</strong><br>
          <em>Listing </em>&ndash; References should be standardized according  to the <strong>Vancouver style</strong> - <strong><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3142758/">Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to  Biomedical Journals: Writing and Editing for Biomedical Publication</a></strong>, organized in order of citation.

In other cases, should display only the first author (followed  by &ldquo;et al.&rdquo; in cases of multiple authors).</p>
      <p><strong>Examples:</strong> <br>
        The promotion of health in the population has  as a reference the article by Evans and Stoddart9, which considers  the distribution of income, social development and individual reaction in  determining health and disease processes.<br>
        According to Lima et al.9 (2006),  the prevalence of mental disorders in medical students is higher than in the  general population.</p>
      <p><strong>Tables</strong> <br>
        Should be presented at the end of the text,  after the references, consecutively numbered with Arabic numerals in the order  they are mentioned in the text. Each one should have a brief title, no  horizontal or vertical markings. Notes should be placed at the footnotes of the  table and not in the header or title. If a table is extracted from another work,  previously published, authors should formally request authorization from the  journal which published it, for reproduction.<br>
        For a readable table, the maximum number of  columns is 10, depending on the amount of the contents of each cell. Notes in  tables should be indicated by letters and be underlined.</p>
      <p><strong>Figures</strong> <br>
      Illustrations (photographs, drawings, graphs  etc.) should be cited as Figures and numbered consecutively with Arabic  numerals in the order they are mentioned in the text and presented after the  tables. Should contain a title and caption displayed at the bottom of the  figure. They will only be accepted for publication if sufficiently clear and with  digital quality, preferably in the vector format. In the JPEG format, the  minimum resolution is 300 dpi. Graphs presented with gridlines will not be  accepted, and the elements (bars, circles) should not present volume (3-D). If  there is a figure extracted from another work, previously published, authors  must request permission in writing to reproduce it.</p>

    <td width="70%"><strong>a) Review of the scientific writing</strong>
      <p>To be published, the approved manuscript is  submitted for review of scientific writing, grammar and style. RSP reserves the  right to make amendments, seeking perfect communication with the readers. The  corresponding author will have access to all the modifications suggested until  the very last proof submitted. Even the English version of the article will be  available for review.</p>
      <p><strong>b) Proofs</strong></p>
      <p>After its approval by the editors, the  manuscript will be checked by a team, responsible for reviewing: scientific  writing (clarity, brevity, objectivity and soundness), grammar and style.</p>
      <p> The corresponding author will receive a  proof, in text file (doc, docx or rtf) with the comments/changes made by the  technical reading staff. The deadline for reviewing this proof is two days.</p>
      <p> If there are still doubts in this proof, the  editorial team will contact the author for a review, until a final version of  the text can be reached. Then, the final text will undergo a grammar review.  After this review, the author will receive a new proof, in the final form for  publication. In this last review, only error corrections can be made, format adjustments  will not be accepted. The deadline for the final review is of one day.</p>
      <p> Articles submitted in Portuguese or Spanish will be translated into  English. About a week after the author has finished proofreading the article, RSP  will send the English version of the article for the author&rsquo;s consideration. During  this review, the author should pay attention to possible misinterpretations,  vocabulary area and mainly content equivalence with the &ldquo;approved original&rdquo;  version. The deadline for reviewing the English version is two days.</p>
    The  Journal adopts a continued publishing system (rolling pass). Thus, the publication  of the article becomes faster: it is not dependent on other articles to compose  an issue, but the individual process of each article. Therefore, we request  compliance with the deadlines.</td>

    <td width="70%"><p>Although  journals receive subsidies from public institutions, these are not sufficient  for their maintenance. Thus, charging a publication fee has become an alternative  to ensure the necessary resources for the production of RSP.</p>
      <p> University  of S&atilde;o Paulo ensures basic resources, but they are not sufficient. So, we have  to rely on additional resources, besides funding agencies.</p>
      <p> RSP  completed 50 years in 2016, and only in 2012 it has started charging  publication fees, an imperative fact to ensure its continuity, especially  allowing to evolve with more advanced technologies that also require higher  quality and technological resources.</p>
      <p> The  amount charged is evaluated regularly. Therefore, for articles submitted from <strong>January 2017</strong> onwards, the fee values  will be BRL 2,200.00 (or  the equivalent in US dollars) for original articles,  reviews and comments, and BRL 1,500.00 (or the equivalent in US dollars) for brief communication.&nbsp; </p>
      The  RSP will provide authors the required proof of payment for requesting  reimbursement from their home institutions, graduate programs or support of  research agencies.</td>
