    <p>Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte&nbsp;-RBME(Brazilian  Journal of Sporting Medicine),  the official publication of the Brazilian Society of Sports and Exercise  Medicine (SBMEE - <em>Sociedade Brasileira de  Medicina do Exerc&iacute;cio e do Esporte</em>), is a bimonthly publication with six  editions during the year (Jan/Feb, Mar/Apr, May/Jun, Jul/Aug, Sep/Oct, and  Nov/Dec), with Portuguese and English versions.  The RBME is listed in the following databases: SciELO, Web of  Science, Excerpta Medica-EMBASE, Physical Education Index, LILACS,  SIRC-Sportdiscus, and Scopus.
    <p> The publication adheres fully to  international standards set out by the International Committee of Medical  Journal Editors (ICMJE), known as the Vancouver style, and its criteria of  uniformity. [<a href="http://www.icmje.org/" target="_blank">http://www.icmje.org/</a>]
    <p><strong>Publication Fee</strong><br>
      To allow for the sustainability and continuity of  the RBME, we inform authors that starting in January 2014 a publication fee was  instituted for articles. Authors are responsible for paying a fee to publish  accepted articles, which will be charged to authors when their respective works  are approved. Following the acceptance of the manuscript and notification by  the editor-in-chief, authors should make a deposit in the name of the Brazilian  Association of Sports Medicine (<em>Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o  Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte</em>) CNPJ (Corporate Taxpayer's ID)  30.504.005-0001-12, Bradesco Bank agency 0449, account number 0001353-6. A copy  of the deposit receipt should be sent to the e-mail <a href="mailto:atharbme@uol.com.br">atharbme@uol.com.br</a> and  include the work protocol number (RBME-0000), the article title, and the name  of the article&rsquo;s author(s). If the article is not sent in  Portuguese and English, a translation fee will be charged.     
    <p> <br>
      Costs: For members of the SBMEE,  the fee isR$  1.250,00 (US$ 430), and for non-members the fee is R$  1.450,00 (US$ 530).  Upon  submitting the manuscript and filling out the registration form, the author  should read and agree to the terms of original authorship, relevance, and  quality, as well as to the charging of the fee. Upon indicating agreement with  these terms, the manuscript will be registered on the system for evaluation.

    <p><strong>Double submission </strong><br>
Articles submitted to the RBME will be considered  for publication only under the condition that they have not been previously  published and are not under evaluation for publication in another periodical,  in part or in whole. The RBME will not consider articles for publication whose  data have been published on the internet for public access. If a submitted  article includes material in figures or tables already published in another  location, the submission of the article must be accompanied by a copy of the original  material and written permission to re-publish the material.</p>
    <p><strong>Conflict of interests</strong><br>
      Authors should make explicit any potential  conflict of interests related to the submitted article, in accordance with  rules of the National Health Surveillance Agency (RDC 102/2000) and the Federal  Board of Medicine (Resolution n. 1595/2000). This is required to notify  editors, copyeditors, and readers about professional and/or financial  relationships (such as sponsorship and corporate affiliations) with financial agents  related to pharmaceutical products or equipment involved in the article, which  could theoretically influence interpretations and conclusions in said article.  The declaration of conflict of interest will be published at the end of every  article.</p>
    <p><strong>Bioethics of experimentation on human beings</strong><br>
      The performance of experiments involving human  beings must comply with specific resolutions by the National Health Board (n.  196/96), available at <a href="http://www.conselho.saude.gov.br/">http://www.conselho.saude.gov.br</a>, including the signing of a Clarified  Consent Form and the protection of the privacy of participants.</p>
    <p>
  <strong>Bioethics of experimentation on animals</strong><br>
      The performance of experiments involving animals  must comply with specific resolutions (Law n. 6638 from May 8, 1979, and Decree  n. 24645 from July 10, 1934).</p>
    <p><strong>Clinical trials </strong><br>
      The RBME supports the policies for registering  clinical trials stipulated by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the  International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), recognizing the  importance of these initiatives for the registration and international  dissemination of information about open-access clinical trials. Therefore,  articles will only be accepted for publication if clinical trials have received  an identification number from one of the Clinical Trial Registries validated by  criteria established by the WHO and ICMJE [<a href="http://www.icmje.org/about-icmje/faqs/clinical-trials-registration/">http://www.icmje.org/about-icmje/faqs/clinical-trials-registration/</a>], whose e-mail addresses are available on the  ICMJE website. The identification number should be reported in the text of the  article.</p>
    <p><strong>Peer-review</strong><strong> </strong><br>
      All submitted articles will be evaluated by  reviewers (using a double blind procedure) with professional experience and  competence in the respective subject areas of the articles, and who will issue  evaluations that will be utilized by editors to decide whether to accept the  article. Criteria for evaluating the articles include: originality, relevant  contribution to the field, suitable methodology, clarity, and timely relevance.  Because of the growing number of submissions to the RBME, articles will also be  evaluated in regard to their relevance and contribution to specific knowledge  in the field. Therefore, articles with suitable methodology and relevant  results may not be accepted for publication if they are deemed to be of little  relevance by editors. These decisions to decline an article are not subject to  appeal or challenge by the authors. Articles accepted for publication may  undergo editorial changes to facilitate clarity and understanding - without,  however, altering their content.</p>
    <p><strong>Correction of printer&rsquo;s proofs</strong><br>
      As soon as they are ready, printer&rsquo;s proofs will  be sent in electronic format to the author&rsquo;s e-mail. Authors should return,  also via e-mail, the printer&rsquo;s proofs with necessary corrections within at most  48 hours of their receipt. This measure aims to speed up the process of reviewing  and publishing the article.</p>
    <p><strong>Copyrights</strong><br>
      All statements made in the articles are the sole  responsibility of the authors. However, all published articles become the  property of the publisher, who assumes all copyrights. Therefore, none of the  articles published in the RBME can be commercialized without the written  permission of the publisher. All the authors of articles submitted to RBME must draft and sign a  Copyright Transfer Agreement, which goes into effect upon the date  of the article&rsquo;s acceptance.</p>
    <p><strong>Preparation of manuscripts </strong><br>
      The RBME journal receives the following types of manuscript: original  article, revised article, systematic review, update, meta-analysis, case report  and commented article.<br>
      Submitted articles should be typed  using 12-point Arial font, double-spaced, on A4 paper, without paragraph or  line numbers, and with page numbers in the upper right corner. Figures and  tables should be provided at the end of the article on separate pages. The body  of the text should indicate the locations where the tables or figures should be  inserted. Numbers smaller than 10 should be written out in full, while numbers  equal to or larger than 10 should be written using Arabic numerals. Manuscripts  that do not comply with instructions regarding style and format will be  returned without review by the Editorial Board. </p>
    <p> Measures should be expressed in the  International System (SI), available at <a href="http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units">http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units</a>, and use standard units, where  applicable. Authors are urged not to use abbreviations in the title and limit  their use in the abstract and in the text. Generic names should be used for all  drugs. Pharmaceutical medication can be referred to using their commercial  names, but the manufacturer&rsquo;s name, city, and country, or e-mail address, must  be included in parentheses in the Materials and Methods section.</p>
    <p><strong>Abbreviations </strong><br>
      The use of abbreviations should  be kept to a minimum. Abbreviations should be defined upon their first use in  the abstract as well as in the text. Non-standard abbreviations should not be  used, unless they appear at least three times in the text.</p>
    <p> Measurement units (3ml or 3mL,  instead of 3 milliliters) and standard scientific symbols (chemical elements,  for example Na, instead of sodium) are not considered abbreviations, and  therefore should not be defined. Abbreviate long names or chemical substances  and terms utilized for therapeutic combinations. Abbreviations in figures and  tables may be used because of space limitations, but these should be defined in  the caption, even if they have already been defined in the article text.</p>
    <p><strong>Author identification </strong><br>
      The  ORCID number (Open Researcher and Contributor ID<em>,</em> <a href="http://orcid.org/">http://orcid.org/</a>)&nbsp;of each author should be  noted in the declaration of author contribution, according to the model below.</p>
    <p>        <strong>Declaration of author contribution </strong><br>
      The author  contribution declaration should be included at the end of the article,  utilizing two minimal criteria for authorship, including:</p>

The names of  institutions and programs should preferably be presented in full and in the institution&rsquo;s  original language, or in English when not written using the Roman alphabet  (e.g., Arabic, Mandarin, or Greek);</p>
    <p>  <strong>Abstract </strong><br>
      The abstract  in Portuguese, English, and Spanish should be included with the manuscript.  Each version of the abstract should contain no more than 300 words. A  structured version is mandatory in original articles, and includes introduction, objectives,  methods, results, and conclusion. Review articles do not require a structured  abstract.<br>
      <br>
      Graphical Abstracts will be accepted. The information  must consist of a concise, pictorial&nbsp;and visual image of the main  conclusions of the article. This can be either the&nbsp;article conclusion  figure or a figure especially designed for this purpose, which captures the  content of the article for readers at a single glance. The figures include all  the illustrations, such as photographs, drawings, maps, graphs, etc., and must  be identified with the name of the article.<br>
Graphical abstracts are optional and must be sent in a  separate, identified file.<br>
The file must have .tif and/or jpg file extension.  Files ending in.xls (Excel); .eps; .psd for curved line illustrations (graphs,  drawings and diagrams) are also accepted.<br>
<br>
In addition, the Level of Evidence and the Type of Study must be included in the abstracts, in accordance with the classification table attached at the end of this text. </p>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <p>      <strong>Keywords<br>
</strong>The  article must include no fewer than three and no more than six keywords in the  portuguese, english and spanish versions, based on the Health Sciences Descriptors (DeCS) <a href="http://decs.bvs.br/">http://decs.bvs.br/</a>, the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) of the  National Library of Medicine, available at <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html</a>, or based on the  Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)  of the Index Medicus (<a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/</a>).</p>
    <p>        <strong>Introduction</strong><br>
      The  introduction should include: (1) an objective justification for the study, with  pertinent references to the subject, without need of an extensive review; (2)  the article&rsquo;s objectives.</p>
    <p>  <strong>Materials and Methods </strong><br>
      This section should describe the  experiments (quantitatively and qualitatively) and the procedures with  sufficient details to allow other researchers to reproduce the results or give  continuity to the study, and should contain: (1) a clear description of the  sample used; (2) informed consent form for  experimental studies involving human beings; (3) identification of methods, instruments (name of manufacturer with address,  city, and country noted in parentheses), and procedures utilized; (4) brief  description and references to methods that have been published but are not  widely known; (5) detailed description of new or modified methods; and (6) when  pertinent, include a statistical analysis and programs utilized.
    </p>
    <p> Important: When describing  experiments with human beings or animals, indicate whether the proceedings  complied with norms stipulated by the Ethical Committee for Human Experiments  of the institution where the study was carried out, and whether proceedings  comply with the 1995 Helsinki declaration and the Animal Experimentation  Ethics, respectively. Authors should include a declaration that the protocol  was approved by the Ethics Committee of the institution (with which at least  one of the authors is affiliated), with the respective identification number.  The authors should also confirm that the Free and Informed Consent Form was  signed by all participants.</p>
    <p>  <strong>Results</strong> <br>
      Present the results in a logical  sequence in the text, using tables and figures. Avoid excessive repetition of  data in the text, tables, or figures, however, emphasizing merely the most  important discoveries.</p>
    <p>  <strong>Discussion</strong><br>
      Emphasize the  original and important aspects of the study and the conclusions that are its  outcome, avoiding the repetition of data already presented in other sections of  the manuscript. In experimental studies, highlight the relevance and  limitations of the results, contrasting them with the data from the literature  and including implications for future studies.</p>
    <p>  <strong>Conclusions</strong> <br>
      The conclusion should be clear and  concise, based on the obtained results and establishing a connection with  clinical implications, avoiding, however, excessive generalizations. The same  emphasis should be given to studies with negative or positive results.  Recommendations may be included when relevant.</p>
    <p>  <strong>Acknowledgments</strong><br>
      When pertinent, include acknowledgments  of people who have contributed to the development of the study but who do not  qualify as co-authors. Sources of financing such as research support or study  grants should be recognized in this section. Authors should obtain written  permission to include the names and institutions of everyone who is named in  the acknowledgments.</p>
    <p>  <strong>References </strong><br>
      References should be numbered according  to the sequence in which they appear in the text, in superscript format. The  references cited only in the captions of tables or figures should be numbered  according to the sequence established by the first mention of the table or  figure in the text. The style of bibliographic references should follow rules  established in the Uniform  Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals (International Committee  of Medical Journal Editors - Ann Intern Med<em>.&nbsp;</em>1997;126(1):36-47, available at <a href="http://www.icmje.org">http://www.icmje.org</a>). Some examples are shown  below. The titles of periodicals should be abbreviated in accordance with the  Index Medicus (List of Journals Indexed &ndash; available at <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/serials/lji.html">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/serials/lji.html</a><u>)</u>. If the periodical is not  included in this list, abbreviations should follow suggestions provided by the  periodical itself. References such as &ldquo;personal communication&rdquo; or &ldquo;unpublished  observations&rdquo; should be avoided. Summaries of studies presented at events  should be use only if they serve as the only source of information.  All references for the current or previous five  years must be in bold.</p>

    <p><strong>Tables</strong><br>
      Tables should be constructed using 1.5 line  spacing and sized so as to have a width of one (8.7 cm) or two (18 cm) columns.  Each table should include a succinct title. Explanatory notes should be  included in footnotes. The table should contain means and dispersion measures  (standard deviation, standard error of the mean, etc.), and should not contain  irrelevant decimal places. Abbreviations should be in accordance with those  used in the text and in the figures. Codes to identify items in the table  should be listed in the order they appear along the horizontal position and  should be identified by standard symbols. Graphs and tables should be sent in  their original editable files (Word, Excel) and not as images.</p>
    <p>  <strong>Figures</strong> <br>
      The printed edition of  the RBME accepts black-and-white figures. Colored images can be published when  essential for the scientific content of the article. In these cases, the  additional cost will be passed on to the authors. Color figures can be included  in the electronic version of the article without additional cost to the  authors. Drawings and figures should be consistent and as simple as possible,  yet informative. Grayscale should not be used. All lines should be solid. For  bar graphs, for example, use bars that are white, black, with diagonal lines in  both directions, hatched lines, horizontal lines, and vertical lines. The RBME  strongly advises against using photographs with equipment and animals utilized  in the experiment. Figures should be printed with adequate contrast and be the  width of one column (8.7 cm). When the figure provided is  an x-ray or photograph, we suggest including a scale when pertinent.</p>
    <p> Please note that it is the  authors&rsquo; responsibility to obtain permission from copyright holders to  reproduce figures (or tables) that have been previously published in other  sources. According to open source principles, the authors should get permission  from the copyright holders should they wish to include images that were  published in other periodicals that are not open-access. This authorization  should be included in the caption for the figure, and the original source  should be included in the list of references.</p>
    <p><strong>Videos</strong><br>
      Submission of videos is optional, and will accompany  the online version of the article. The video must be sent together with the article in a separate file and  accompanied by captions. Videos must be sent in MP4 digital format. </p>

      <strong>Types of articles</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Original article</strong><br>
      The RBME accepts all types of original research in  the areas of Exercise and Sports Medicine and Sciences, including studies with  human beings and experimental research. The article should contain the  following items: structured abstract, keywords, introduction, materials and  methods, results, discussion, and conclusions.</p>
    <p>        <strong>Review articles</strong><br>
      Review articles are  usually requested by the editor of authors with proven experience in the field.  These should reflect the experience of the author and not simply reflect a  review of the literature. Review articles should approach specific themes with  the aim of updating less familiarized readers with specific subjects, topics,  or issues in the areas of Exercise  and Sports Medicine and Sciences. The Editorial Board will evaluate the  quality of the article, the relevance of the chosen topic, and the attested  standing of authors in the specific field of study. Inadequacy in any of the  aforementioned items will lead to the refusal of the article by editors, and it  will not be sent on to the peer review process.</p>
    <p>        <strong>Systematic  review/updating/meta-analysis</strong><br>
      The RBME encourages authors to submit articles that provide a systematic  review of literature in the areas of Exercise and Sports Medicine and Sciences.  The Editorial Board will evaluate the quality of the article, the relevance of  the chosen theme, the procedure for bibliographic searches, the criteria for inclusion of articles, and the statistic procedures  utilized. Inadequacy in any of the  aforementioned items will lead to the refusal of the article by editors, and it  will not be sent on to the peer review process<br>
      <br>
      <b>Manuscripts Sending</b></span><br>
All articles should be submitted directly on the<br>
site http://submission.scielo.br/index.php/rbme. As part of the electronic submittal<br>
of the article, authors should attach the following supplementary documents: (1)<br>
Term of Disclosure of Possible Conflicts of Interests; (2) Term of Transfer of<br>
Copyrights; (3) Declaration of Contribution of Authors with the ORCID number<br>
(Open Researcher and Contributor ID) of each author. Article submission will not be<br>
accepted via e-mail, post mail, or any means other than electronic submissions via<br>
the abovementioned website. <br>
<br>
Since January 2008, the RBME adopted the SciELO System for online      publication and submission, available<br>
at <a href="http://submission.scielo.br/index.php/aob/index">http://submission.scielo.br/index.php/aob/index</a>. Authors should follow<br>
instructions to register and upload articles on the system.
