    <td width="15%"></td>
    <td width="70%">The <b>Revista de Microbiologia </b>is intended to publish 
      original research papers, research notes and, occasionally, reviews, covering 
      all aspects of Microbiology. The texts submitted for publication must be 
      written in English, and must include Title, Summary and Keywords in Portuguese. 
      The journal has a severe policy of manuscript evaluation, and each manuscript 
      is evaluated by at least two criteriously selected referees.
      <p><b>Submitting manuscripts</b></p>
      <p>Membership in Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia is not a prerequisite 
        for acceptance of a manuscript for publication. Nonmember scientists from 
        Brazil and other countries are invited to submit papers for consideration 
        for publication.</p>
      <p>Submission of a manuscript implies that all authors and their institutions 
        have agreed to its publication. Submission of a manuscript to the <b>Revista 
        de Microbiologia</b> is understood to imply that it has not previously 
        been published (except in an abstract form) and that it is not being considered 
        for publication elsewhere.</p>
      <p><b>Revista de Microbiologia</b> assumes no responsibility for errors 
        made by authors. Furthermore, the journal assumes no responsibility for 
        conclusions reached by the authors.</p>
      <p>All manuscripts should be mailed in triplicate to the <a
    href="iedboard.htm#Editors">Editors</a> (for the time being, texts mailed 
        eletronically or by fax are not accepted) at the address below.</p>
      <b>
      <p>Publication of a manuscript</p>
      </b> 
      <p>Manuscripts are accepted for publication only after they are critically 
        reviewed. Papers are reviewed by referees indicated by the Editors. After 
        review, the manuscript will be returned to the nominated author for revision 
        according to suggestions made by the reviewers.</p>
      <p>The author should return the reviewed manuscript to the Editors. The 
        author is notified when a manuscript is received and also when it is accepted 
        or rejected for publication.</p>
      <p>On acceptance of a paper, the nominated author will be requested to send 
        the text in a computer disquete. Galley proofs will be sent to the author 
        for correction. They should be checked carefully and handed promptly (5 
        days) according to instructions which are attached.

      <p>Types of paper</p>
      </b> 
      <p>The following types of paper are acceptable for publication in the <b>Revista 
        de Microbiologia</b>:</p>
      <p><i></i><b>Research paper</b> reports results of original research which 
        have not been published elsewhere. It consists of 12 to 15 double-spaced 
        typewritten pages plus appropriate references, tables and figures. An 
        abstract with title (Resumo) and three to five keywords (Palavras-chave) 
        in Portuguese must also be included.</p>
      <p><i></i><b>Short Communication</b> is a concise account of new and significant 
        findings. It should be written according to the guidelines given for research 
        papers, but without heading divisions. It's abstract and resumo (in Portuguese) 
        should not exceed 50 words. Figures and tables should be restricted to 
        a maximum of two figures or two tables, or one table and one figure. The 
        designation &quot;short communication&quot; will appear on the top of 
        the title of this type of paper. The author should specify that his manuscript 
        is a short communication so that it can be properly evaluated during the 
        review process.</p>
      <p><i></i><b>Mini-review</b> - Review articles should deal with microbiological 
        subjects of broad interest. Specialists will be called upon to write them. 
        In addition to the Abstract in English and in Portuguese (Resumo), they 
        may contain a list of contents.</p>
      <b>
      <p>Preparation of a manuscript</p>
      </b> 
      <p><b>General</b></p>
      <p>1. All manuscripts should be typed double-spaced with wide margins and 
        the pages should be numbered sequentially. Research papers should be restricted 
        to 15 printed pages, including figures and tables. Short Communications 
        should be restricted to 6 printed pages.</p>
      <p>2. All manuscripts should be submmitted written in English. The Editors 
        recommend that a manuscript should be critically read by someone fluent 
        in English before it is submitted. Manuscripts in poor English will not 
        be accepted.</p>
      <p>3. The paper should be organized in topics, as described in the next 
        paragraph. The name of the topics should be typed in capital letters (e.g. 
        ABSTRACT, INTRODUCTION etc). Citation of tables and figures should initiate 
        with capital letters (e.g. as shown in Table 1..., as presented in Fig. 
        2..., etc).</p>
      <p>4. Abbreviations of therms and symbols should follow the recommendations 
        of IUPAC-IUB Commission and the Metric System is to be used throughout.</p>
      <p>5. As a rule, the references in the text should be cited by their numbers. 
        Exceptionally, when authors are mentioned in the text, the mention should 
        be done according to the following examples: Bergdoll (number) reported 
        that..., Bailey and Cox (number) observed that..., or Smith <i>et al</i>. 
        (number) mentioned that... Do not use capital letters.</p>
      <p>6. Authors of accepted papers will be requested to send a 3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>&quot; 
        disquete containing the text prepared in a PC based word processor. Authors 
        may also send this material by e-mail.</p>
      <b>
      <p>Organization</p>
      </b> 
      <p><b>Title Page</b>: A separate page should be used to give the title of 
        the paper, complete name (including first name and middle initials) and 
        affiliation of each author. An asterisk should be placed after the name 
        of the author to whom correspondence about the paper should be sent. The 
        telephone and fax numbers and e-mail address (when available) of this 
        author should be given at the bottom of the page. No text of the manuscript 
        should appear on the title page. The title should be a brief as possible, 
        contain no abbreviations and be truly indicative of the subject of the 
        paper. Expressions like &quot;Effects of&quot;, &quot;Influence of&quot;, 
        &quot;Study on&quot; etc. should be avoided. Care should be exercised 
        in preparing the title since it is used in literature retrieval systems.</p>
      <p><b>Abstract</b>: The abstract should be typed in a separate page and 
        should not exceed 250 words. It should summarize the basic content of 
        the paper. The abstract should be meaningful without having to read the 
        remainder of the paper. An abstract should not contain references, tables 
        or anusual abbreviations. Abstracts are reprinted by abstracting journals 
        and hence will be read by persons who do not have access to the entire 
        paper. Hence the abstract must be prepared with great care. Three to five 
        keywords should also be included.</p>
      <p><b>Resumo</b>: <i>Resumo</i> is the abstract written in Portuguese. Its 
        preparation should follow the same recommendations for the Abstract in 
        English. The <i>resumo</i> should also contain a title in Portuguese. 
        The rules for the title in Portuguese are the same as for the title in 
        English (see above). Three to five <i>palavras-chave</i> (keywords) must 
        also be included. The <i>resumo</i> and the title in Portuguese should 
        also be typed in a separate page.</p>
      <p><b>Introduction</b>: It should begin on a new page and provide the reader 
        with sufficient information so that the results reported in the paper 
        can be properly evaluated without refering to the literature. However, 
        the introduction should not be an extensive review of the literature. 
        The introduction should also give the rationale for and objetives of the 
        study that is being reported.</p>
      <p><b>Materials and Methods</b>: This section should provide enough information 
        for other investigators to repeat the work. Repetititon of details of 
        procedures which have already been published elesewhere should be avoided. 
        If a published method is modified, such modification(s) must be described 
        in the paper. Sources of reagents, culture media and equipments (company, 
        city, state, country) should be mentioned in the text. Names that are 
        registered trade marks should be so indicated. Subheading often make this 
        section easier to read and understand.</p>
      <p><b>Results</b>: This section should, by means of text, tables and/or 
        figures, give the results of the experiments. If a <i>Discussion</i> section 
        is to be included, avoid extensive interpretation of results but do so 
        in the <i>Discussion</i> section. If <i>Results</i> and <i>Discussion 
        </i>are combined, then results should be discussed where, in the text, 
        is the more appropriate. Tables should be numbered independently of the 
        figures using Arabic numerals. All tables and figures must be mentioned 
        in the text. The approximate location of tables and figures in the text 
        should be indicated.</p>
      <p><b>Discussion</b>: The discussion should provide an interpretation of 
        the results in relation to known information.</p>
      <p><b>Acknowledgments</b>: This section is optional and follows the Discussion. 
        It acknowledges financial and personal assistance.</p>
      <p><b>References</b>: Arrange references in alphabetical order, by last 
        name of the author. All authors must be cited. Number the references consecutively. 
        Cite each reference in the text by its number. Journal names should be 
        abbreviated according to the style of <i>Biological Abstracts</i> or <i>Chemical 
        Abstracts</i>. All references given in the list should be cited in the 
        text and all references mentioned in the text should be included in the 
        list. List references according to the style shown in the following examples:</p>

        data&quot; are discouraged, although it is recognized that sometimes they 
        must be used. In these cases, they should be cited in the text and not 
        in the list of references. References consisting of papers that are &quot;accepted 
        for publication&quot; or &quot;in press&quot; are acceptable. However, 
        references of papers that are &quot;submitted&quot; or &quot;in preparation&quot;

        a separate page and numbered sequentially with an Arabic number. The title 
        of a table should be placed in the top of it and should be brief but fully 
        descriptive of the information in the table. Headings and subheadings 
        should be concise with columns and rows of data carefully centered below 
        them.</p>
      <b>
      <p>Figures</p>

      </b>
      <p>Only those photographs which are strictly necessary for the understanding 
        of the paper should be submitted. Photoprints should be of sufficient 
        quality to ensure good reproduction. They should be numbered on the back 
        and identified with the nominated author's name. Legends of line drawings 
        and photographs should not exceed the printing area. All elements in the 
        drawing should be prepared to withstand reductions. Drawings and line 
        figures should be drawn or printed in black and should be prepared as 
        indicated for the photographs. Colored illustrations are not accepted.</p>
      <b>
