 <p>The topic covered by<b> Hist&oacute;ria da Educa&ccedil;&atilde;o</b> is Hist&oacute;ria da Educa&ccedil;&atilde;o. Its purpose is mainly to disseminate results of research performed by teachers and undergraduate and graduate students on this subject.</p>
 <p>Aiming to achieve this purpose, the journal accepts for publication:</p>
 <ol type="a">
 <li>articles involving history and historiography of education, originating in theoretical studies, methodological reflections and discussions in general, that pertain to the field of historiography;</li>
 <li>commissioned work and translations;</li>
 <li>critiques, in which the presentation of the content is expected, and commentaries about recent publications or academically acknowledged work;</li>
 <li>documents, materials considered important and difficult to access, that can help provide further information for studies. </li>
 </ol>
 <p>The journal follows the normalization standards established by the Brazilian Association of Technical Standards - ABNT.</p>
 <p>The texts submitted to the journal must be as yet unpublished, by Brazilian or foreign authors, written in Portuguese or Spanish. Texts in English and French are accepted, as long as they are accompanied by the respective translation.</p>
 <p>For publication, the texts undergo the following evaluation stages.</p>
 <blockquote>
  <p><b>Stage 1: analysis of the form</b></p>
  <p>This stage is the editors' responsibility. The texts are evaluated as to appropriateness to the general criteria of the journal and to the editorial line.</p>
  <p>The following articles are returned to the authors:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>reports on experience;</li>
  <li>only a review of literature;</li>
  <li>a simple passage from a thesis or dissertation, without the appropriate adaptation;</li>
  <li>presented in the form of a project or research report;</li>
  <li>do not present a sufficiently in-depth analysis of the topic they propose to discuss;</li>
  <li>do not focus the problems they discuss, even indirectly, on the field of Hist&oacute;ria da Educa&ccedil;&atilde;o;</li>
  <li>present excessive errors of composition, as well as of text structure, to the point that they make it difficult to understand parts or even the entire text;</li>
  <li>are merely descriptive and do not present an analysis of the problems discussed;</li>
  <li>are not in the form of an article as usually practiced in periodicals;</li>
  <li>do not meet the editorial standards of the journal.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Texts with these characteristics are returned to the authors with the suggestion that they be rewritten and resubmitted for a new evaluation. The papers that do not fit into any of the characteristics above will be considered appropriate for the second stage.</p>
  <p><b>Stage 2: peer analysis regarding merit</b></p>
  <p>In the second stage, the article, without identifying the author, is sent to at least two reviewers in the specific thematic area of the work (members of the editorial council or <i>ad hoc</i> guest reviewers) from two different states of the country or from abroad. Information available in the journal register is taken into account to designate the reviewers.</p>
  <p>The criteria for text evaluation take into account:</p>
  <ol type="a">
  <li>formal aspects of the text;</li>
  <li>currency and relevance of the topic;</li>
  <li>originality and the fact that it is not something that has been published previously;</li>
  <li>clear indication of the objectives;</li>
  <li>research methodology;</li>
  <li>up to date theoretical discussion;</li>
  <li>appropriateness of the bibliography;</li>
  <li>relevance of documents to be published or attached.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The reviewers can accept fully, accept conditionally, or refuse the article. Any of the situations is justified by a descriptive report.</p>
  <p>Situations:</p>
  <ol type="a">
  <li>  when the two reviewers accept the work, it goes on to the next phase;</li>
  <li>   when both reviewers refuse the work, the article is returned to the author and filed away in the journal system;</li>
  <li>when one or both reviewers request information, the paper is returned to the author asking them to consider the reports and rewrite the article within thirty days. When the author resends the rewritten text and shows that they have followed the reviewers' suggestions, it is submitted to a new evaluation.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><b>Stage 3: review and adaptation of the paper to the journal standards</b></p>
  <p>Once it has been accepted for publication, the paper is submitted to a review of the language, normalization and formatting.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p><b>Invited authors</b></p>
  <p>The editors can invite people of renowned academic production on the subject of Hist&oacute;ria da Educa&ccedil;&atilde;o to publish in the journal. The texts of the invited authors are submitted to the same stages of evaluation as the other articles.</p>
  <p><b>Dossiers</b></p>
  <p>Dossiers should be proposed with an inter-institutional character and discuss topics of relevance for the field of Hist&oacute;ria da Educa&ccedil;&atilde;o in order to broaden the academic debate and foster research exchanges. They should consist of a presentation and up to five articles by authors affiliated to at least three institutions, with the participation of at least one researcher affiliated to the foreign institution.</p>
  <p><b>Critiques</b></p>
  <p>Critiques are also published and they must meet the following guidelines:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>they must refer to a work involving Hist&oacute;ria da Educa&ccedil;&atilde;o;</li>
   <li>they must be written in Portuguese or Spanish. If they are written in English or in French, they must be accompanied by the respective translation;</li>
   <li>they must be unpublished, contain the complete identification of the work and be up to 17,000 characters (with spaces) long, including, if any, citations and bibliographical references;</li>
   <li>they must be structured based on the description of the work content, faithful to the main ideas, foundations, methodology, and also critical analysis, i.e., a dialogue between the author of the critique and the work;</li>
   <li>they should present textual quality as to style and academic language.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The stages for evaluation of the critiques are the same used for articles.</p>
  <p><b>Documents</b></p>
  <p>The Documents section publishes materials considered important and difficult to access, which can provide additional information for studies.</p>
  <p>The documents must be transcribed seeking to preserve as much as possible of the original characteristics. At least the complete bibliographical reference and its location (archives, library) must be given, and they must be accompanied by an introduction.</p>
  <p>The stages to evaluate the documents are the same used for articles.</p>
  <p><b>Translations</b></p>
  <p>Translations should be accompanied by an authorization given by the author of the original work or by the publishing house that may have published the text. If the work is in the public domain, this procedure is not necessary, and it is the author of the translation who is responsible for this information.</p>
  <p>The translations must also be accompanied by the text in the original language.</p>
  <p><b>Papers presented at events</b></p>
  <p>Exceptionally, works may be accepted for publications that have already been presented at events. The proposals are subject to the same evaluation criteria as unpublished original works.</p>
  <p>It is the author who must inform the credits of the event at which the work was originally presented.</p>
  <p><b>Key-words or descriptors</b></p>
  <p>The abstracts must be accompanied by three to five key-words that describe the thematic content of the text clearly and concisely.</p>
  <p>They must be written in a way that makes it easier to retrieve the text.</p>
  <p><b>Statement of responsibility</b></p>
  <p>The authors are responsible for the veracity and for the statement that the work has never been published before. The manuscript submitted must be accompanied by a statement of responsibility, signed by all authors, declaring that the study has not been published before, in part or completely, in printed or electronic medium, nor sent for publication in other periodicals, and that all the authors participated in the intellectual elaboration of its content.</p>
  <p><b>Conflict of interest</b></p>
  <p>Conflict of interest is the situation in which the authors have interests that might influence the process of elaborating the manuscripts. These are conflicts of various kinds - personal, commercial, political, academic or financial - to which anyone is exposed, and for this reason the authors must acknowledge and reveal them when present, in the statement of responsibility.</p>
  <p><b>Sources of funding</b></p>
  <p>The authors must declare all sources of funding or support, institutional or personal, to perform the study. The name of the institution or person must be identified, and also the city, state and country of origin. This information must be part of the statement of responsibility.</p>
  <p><b>Authorship criteria</b></p>
  <p>To be considered an author, the proponent must have participated sufficiently in the work to be able to take public responsibility for its content. Participation should include:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>concept, design, analysis and interpretation of the data;</li>
   <li>writing and revising the manuscript;</li>
   <li>final approval of the version to be published.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><b>Acknowledgements</b></p>
  <p>When desirable and pertinent, it is recommended to name the people who helped produce the study, even if they do not meet the criteria for authorship. Authors are responsible for obtaining the authorization of these people before mentioning them in the acknowledgements.</p>
  <p>Acknowledgement of institutions for their financial or logistical support to performing the study can also be included. Impersonal expressions of gratefulness should also be avoided.</p>
  <p><b>Indication of affiliation</b></p>
  <p>Besides the personal information required by the Seer/OJS environment, the author must indicate the affiliation, or institutional ties that should be presented in a complete form, with the name, complete without abbreviations, of the institution and its address.</p>
