    <td width="70%"><p>Manuscripts submitted to ABO should fit  into one of the following categories according to their format. The maximum  number of words, figures, tables and, references for each type of manuscript  are in parentheses at the end of the description for each category. The word  count of the manuscript includes the text from the beginning of the  introduction up to the end of the discussion; therefore, the following items  are not included: title page, abstract, references, acknowledgments, tables and  figures, including legends.
      <p><b>Editorials</b>
      <p> Editorials are contributed by  invitation and should be related to topics of current interest, preferentially  related to articles published in the same issue of ABO (title, maximum of 1,000  words, 2 figures or tables, and 10 references).
      <p><b>Original Articles</b>
      <p> Original articles present complete  experiments with results that have never been published before (title,  structured abstract, maximum of 3,000 words, 8 figures or tables, and 30  references). The evaluation of the manuscripts will be based on the following  priorities:
      <ol start="1" type="1">
        <li>New and relevant       information based on       a study that uses appropriate methodology.</li>
        <li>Repetition of       information available in the literature, not previously confirmed locally,       based on a study that       uses appropriate methodology.</li>
        <li>Repetition of       information available in the literature and previously confirmed locally, based on a study that uses       appropriate methodology.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>* Manuscripts containing speculative  conclusions, unsubstantiated by the results or based on a study with  inappropriate methodology will not be accepted.</p>
      <p><b>Case Reports and Case Series</b></p>
      <p> Case reports or case series will be  considered for publication when describing rare and original findings that have  not been internationally confirmed, or when presenting clinical or surgical  responses that can contribute to elucidate the pathophysiology of a disease  (title, unstructured abstract, maximum of 1,000 words, 4 figures or tables, and  10 references).</p>
      <p><b>Letters to the Editor</b></p>
      <p> Letters to the editor are considered  for publication if they contain comments related to manuscripts previously  published in ABO or, exceptionally, the results of original studies with  insufficient content to be submitted as Original Article. These letters should  present new information or new interpretation of existing information. When the  content of the letter refers to an article previously published in ABO, such  article should be mentioned in the first paragraph of the letter and included  in its reference list. In these cases, the letters will be linked to the  article, and the authors of the article will have their right of reply  guaranteed in the same issue. Congratulation letters will not be published  (title, maximum of 700 words, 2 figures or tables, and 5 references).</p>
      <p><b>Review Articles</b></p>
      Review articles follow the editorial line and  are also accepted if submitted. Suggestions of topics for  review articles should be sent directly to the editor, but manuscripts cannot  be sent without an invitation (title, unstructured abstract, maximum of 4,000  words, 8 figures or tables, and 100 references).</td>

    <td width="70%" height="385"><p>Manuscripts will only be considered for  publication if they meet all the journal's requirements. The editorial office  will inform the authors if their manuscript fails to meet such requirements.  Upon notification, the corresponding author will have 30 days to make the  necessary changes in the manuscript. If the deadline is not met, the manuscript  will be excluded from the editorial process.
      <p> The manuscripts submitted to ABO are  initially evaluated by the editors to check for content compliance with the  editorial line of the journal. After this assessment, all manuscripts are sent  for peer review. The anonymity of reviewers is preserved throughout the whole  process. However, the authors of manuscripts do not remain anonymous.
      <p> After the initial editorial evaluation,  the reviewers' comments can be sent to the authors to guide the changes to be  implemented in the text. After implementing the changes suggested by the  reviewers, the revised manuscript should be resubmitted along with a letter  (which is sent as a supplementary document) with specific indications of all  changes made to the manuscript or the reasons why the suggested changes were  not made. Manuscripts that are resubmitted without a letter will be withheld  until the editorial office receives the letter. The deadline to submit the new  version of the manuscript is 30 days after the authors are informed of the need  to make changes in their manuscript. Manuscripts will be excluded from the  process if authors fail to meet this deadline. The ultimate publication will be  based on the final approval of the editors.
      Manuscripts submitted to ABO should not be  simultaneously considered for publication by other journals. In addition, total  or partial publication or translation for publication in another language of  the manuscripts submitted to ABO should not be considered without the  permission of the editors of ABO.
      <p><b>Authorship</b> <br>
The criteria for authorship  of manuscripts in medical journals are well         <a href="http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html" target="_blank">established</a>. Individuals who have  contributed in a concrete way during the following three phases of manuscript  preparation should be considered authors:
      <blockquote>
        <p>I. Conception and design,  acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data.<br>
          II. Draft or critical revision  of the article for important intellectual content.<br>
          III. Final approval of the  version to be published.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The authors of manuscripts submitted to  ABO should make sure that all authors meet the criteria mentioned above and  that all persons who meet these criteria are listed. Individuals who hold  headship positions cannot be considered authors of manuscripts based only on  their positions. ABO does not accept the participation of honorary authors.</p>
      The corresponding author should complete and  submit the <a href="http://www.cbo.com.br/site/files/Formulario Contribuicao dos Autores.pdf" target="_blank">Author Contribution Statement</a> as a supplementary  document.
      <p><b>Guidelines  for Excellent Research</b><br>

      <b>13. Corrections and Retractions.</b> Errors may be noted in published manuscripts  that require the publication of a correction. However, some errors pointed out  by any reader may invalidate the results or the authorship of a manuscript. If  substantial doubt arises about the honesty or integrity of a submitted  manuscript, it is the editor's responsibility to exclude the possibility of  fraud. In these situations, the editor will inform the institutions involved  and the funding agencies about the suspicion and wait for their final decision.  If there is confirmation of a fraudulent publication in ABO, the editor will  act in compliance with the <a href="http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/publishing-and-editorial-issues/scientific-misconduct-expressions-of-concern-and-retraction.html" target="_blank">protocols suggested  by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE)</a> and by the <a href="http://publicationethics.org/resources/flowcharts" target="_blank">Committee on  Publication Ethics (COPE)</a>.
