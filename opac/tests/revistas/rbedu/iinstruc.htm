      <p>1. The Brazilian Magazine of Education (<b>Revista Brasileira de Educa&ccedil;&atilde;o</b>)  accepts publication  articles and thematic dossiers about education that have never been published  elsewhere from Brazilian and foreign authors that are the results of research,  as well as theoretical essays and papers that discuss current issues.

      <p>2.  Papers may be sent in portuguese,  english, french or spanish.</p>
      <p>3. The  articles must have a minimum of 40 thousand and a maximum of 70 thousand  characters with spaces, including the bibliographic references and footnotes;  the title abstract and keywords, which must be in Portuguese, English and  Spanish, and in French if the original article is in this language; and  authorial data (the words should be counted with a tool from a word processing  program such as Word or Star Office). </p>
      <p>4.  The publication of articles  is subject to evaluation by the members of the Editorial Board or by <i>ad hoc</i> collaborators. The selection of articles for publication is based on its  contribution to education and to the editorial line of the Magazine, the  originality of the themes or the treatment given to it, as well as the  consistency and rigor of the theoretical-methodological approach. Eventual  modifications in the structure or content, suggested by opinion makers or by  the Editorial Commission, will only be incorporated with agreement of the  authors.</p>
      <p>5. Each  year the journal will issue a public call for proposals with Specific Norms for  Thematic Dossiers.</p>
      <p>6. The <i><b>Revista  Brasileira de Educa&ccedil;&atilde;o</b></i> also publishes documents and book reviews.

      <p>7. Book reviews should not  exceed 10 thousand characters with spaces. A complete bibliographical reference of the work reviewed or  commented is necessary. The typing and formatting should follow the same instructions as those  for the articles. </p>
      <p>8. Articles  that reflect on current and relevant theories and practices, positions,  discussions or polemics or that debate an issue and defend positions, may be  published in the section &ldquo;Espaço Aberto&rdquo; [Open Space]. In this case, the texts  should have from 30-50 thousand characters and follow the same norms and  requirements as the other articles.</p>
      <p>9. Original  texts should be sent to the headquarters of the magazine  through the SciELO system.

      <p>12. References  should contain only those authors and texts cited in the work itself and should  be presented at the end of the text, in alphabetical order, complying with the  most recent ABNT norms. Materials that do not contain bibliographical  references or those presented incorrectly will not be considered for  examination and publication. It may be noted that university librarians are  qualified to offer orientation as to the correct use of norms. Examples of ABNT  norms application may be found at the end of these Norms.</p>

      <p>In conformity with the guidelines of the Committee on Publication  Ethics(<a href="http://publicationethics.org/" target="_blank">COPE</a>), which are designed to  encourage the identification of plagiarism, improper practices, fraud, possible  ethics violations and the opening of inquiries, we inform:</p>
      <p><strong>1. Authors must visit the COPE website&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://publicationethics.org/" target="_blank">http://publicationethics.org</a>, which contains information for authors and editors about research  ethics.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Before submission, authors must follow these  guidelines:</strong></p>
      <p>- articles that include data acquisition or analysis and interpretation  of data from other publications must cite them explicitly;<br>
        - articles that contain a critical review of the intellectual content of other  authors, must properly cite these authors;<br>
        - researchers who do not actively and substantially participate in all the  phases of research and writing of an article should not be included in the list  of authors. The editor can request formal explanations about the participation  in the production of the article by the authors attributed to the article, and  it is up to the editor to accept or not the submission in the manner that the  authorship was presented;<br>
        - all of the authors must meet the criteria for original authorship of the  article and none of the researchers involved in the study can be omitted from  this list of authors.</p>
<p><strong>3. To meet the criteria, the following procedures  will be conducted:</strong></p>
<p>a)The editors will evaluate the manuscripts with the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.crossref.org/08downloads/handouts/crosscheck.pdf" target="_blank"><strong><em>CrossCheck</em></strong></a>&nbsp;system, soon after  the evaluation of the form of the manuscripts. At this time, the textual  content of the articles will be evaluated, seeking to identify plagiarism,  duplicated submissions, manuscripts that have been previously published and  possible research fraud.
<p>b)Based on the results, the editor and editorial board will be  responsible for deciding if the manuscript will be sent for peer review;
<p>c)After acceptance and before publication, the  articles can be evaluated once again.</td>
