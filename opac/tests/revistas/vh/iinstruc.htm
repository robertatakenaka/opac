      <p><i><b>Varia Historia</b></i> publishes:</p>
      <ul>
        <p> 1) open topic articles;  <br>
          2) issue-specific topics (dossiers);<br> 
          3) book reviews. </p>
        <p>All manuscripts should be sent through the on line submission system:<br>
        <a href="https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/vh-scielo">https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/vh-scielo</a></p>
        <p><em><strong>Varia Historia</strong></em> adopts <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank">CC-BY</a> Open Access  license.</p>
        <p>Authors  do not pay any charge for article submission and review process.</p>
      </ul>
      <p><i><b>Varia Historia</b></i> receives manuscripts in Portuguese, English, French and Spanish.</p>
        <p>The Editorial Committee organizes the <strong>Dossiers</strong>, and renowned specialists are invited to present articles in the theme proposed. <strong>Open topic articles </strong>may deal with a whole variety of themes, as long as they are kept within the scope of the mission of our journal. <strong>Book reviews </strong>are expected to consider books in the history field first and foremost. </p>
        <p><i><b>Varia Historia</b></i> does not publish articles neither on didactic issues nor on history of education, for which there are specialized publications. </p>
        <p><strong>All manuscripts</strong> &ndash; those destined to the dossiers as well as the open topic section &ndash; undergo the same publishing process. Once submitted by means of our online system, they are immediately assessed by the Editor-in-Chief and the Editorial Committee. They are judged by their conformity with the mission of our journal, their adequacy to our norms, their innovative nature and general quality standards. The manuscripts may be refused at this first stage of the publishing process.</p>
        <p> If the manuscripts are in conformity with the requirements mentioned, they proceed to the second stage of the process, a <em>double blinded </em>system for two or more referees, who may decide whether the paper should be accepted or not and suggest alterations to be made. In this case, the authors should respond to the suggestions of the referees, who may proceed to another evaluation of the manuscripts. The Editor-in-Chief and the Editorial Committee will take the final decision. Since it is not possible for <i><b>Varia Historia</b></i> to publish the large number of manuscripts it receives, priority will be given to those that are innovative, with a better analytical quality and more refinement in their research into history. The results of these evaluations will be reported to the author no later than six months from the date the article was received. </p>
        <p>The <strong>book reviews </strong>are also submitted through our online system. They are also submitted to the assessment of the Editor-in-Chief and the Editorial Committee and may be accepted or refused at this first stage, and may also receive suggestions for changes. When there is a special case, the editors will indicate one or two referees for a double blinded procedure. The editors will make the final decision. </p>
        <p>One of the requirements of <i><b>Varia Historia</b></i> is that the manuscripts should be submitted by authors who have, at least, a master&rsquo;s degree. The journal does not publish texts by students from Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais&rsquo;s Post-graduation Programs and limits the number of publications by professors of the same University. </p>
        <p><strong><em>Varia Historia</em></strong> asks authors and reviewers  to consult its <strong>Ethical Guidelines</strong> (<a href="http://www.variahistoria.org/ethical-guidelines" target="_blank">http://www.variahistoria.org/ethical-guidelines</a> )  and its <strong>Authorship Guidelines</strong> (<a href="http://www.variahistoria.org/authorship-guidelines" target="_blank">http://www.variahistoria.org/authorship-guidelines</a>).</p></td>

      <p><strong>a) Articles</strong></p>
      <p>Read the instructions below attentively: </p>
      <ul>
        <p>1.	<i><b>Varia Historia</b></i> only publishes original articles. Our expectation is to receive articles that have no substantial similarity to articles or chapters of books already published by the author. It is also relevant that the article is not submitted to any other publishing or editorial process. After its publication in <i><b>Varia Historia</b></i>, the texts can be published somewhere else with our authorization, as long as they include a note with the credits for the initial publication. </p>
        <p>2.	The <strong>dossiers </strong>count on authors of such great excellence that they have become reference for people in the area. But as with <strong>open topic manuscripts</strong>, each original copy submitted will be handed on to two anonymous referees, in accordance to the quality standards of international publications. </p>
        <p>3.	The Editor-in-Chief and the Editorial Committee will decide on the adequacy of each <strong>open topic manuscript</strong> submitted and whether its publishing process will start or not. It is a requirement that every author that signs the article has a master&rsquo;s degree. The originals should not display the name of the author or the institution of origin, and any traces of such information should be omitted, as well as personal acknowledgements and self-references. If the projects submitted is accepted the author will then be asked to include the information mentioned above. </p>
        <p>4.	The articles should have 10 thousand words in the most, including notes, keys, pictures, tables, illustrations and bibliographic references. Use a word count for the whole article and take into account that each image, table of diagram will correspond to a total of 300 words.</p>
        <p> 5.	It is also required that each article has a title, an abstract and three key-words, in Portuguese and in English. The abstract should have a maximum of 150 words.</p>
        <p> 6.	Numbers from one to ten should be written in words, as well as  round tens and hundreds (twenty, three hundred), but we recommend the use of figures for ages (50 years) and time  (3 months, 7 minutes, 80 years). </p>
        <p>7.	Long quoted texts (more than five lines) should comprise one independent paragraph, indented on the left, and the font must be one point smaller than the font of the text; no quotation marks should be used. Short quoted texts (up to five lines) should be inserted in the text, between quotation marks and in italic.</p>
        <p> 8.	Page numbers must be written in full, e.g. p.455-457 (not 455-57 nor 455-7).</p>
        <p> 9.	Full references should be listed in alphabetical order at the end of the article:</p>
        <ul><p> FREYRE,  Gilberto. <em>Ingleses no Brasil</em>. Rio de Janeiro: Topbooks, 2000. </p>
        </ul>
        <p>When quoted throughout the article, the work must be indicated in shortened-reference, in case of in-text citation (Freyre, 2000, p.3) or in a footnote:  </p>
        <ul><p><sup>25</sup> &quot;That the efficiency of the methods of negotiating the 1st set of English in Brazil was only relative, is already established fact&quot; (Freyre, 2000, p.183). </p></ul>
        <p>Op. Cit., Ibid, Idem are not used. Long explanatory notes should be avoided. Whenever possible, combine the footnotes to about one per paragraph. The primary sources or data (letters, rules, etc. archival items) should remain in footnotes, and they are not expected to be included in the final list of references. </p>
        <p>10.<strong> Images</strong>: charts, tables, figures, illustrations, graphs and drawings must be submitted in separate files from the text. Digital images should have high resolution (not interpolated), JPEG format, colour RGB. Charts and tables must be in Word, and the graphs and spreadsheets in Excel, with indication of titles and sources. Please do not send images in Word because of the low quality resolution. All images must be numbered and have a key, with indication of the source. The author must present the permit for the use of each image (or state that such images are in the public domain, if this is the case). The original colour of the images will be preserved in the online version, but in black and white in the press. Special cases will be analyzed by the Editorial Committee. Each image will correspond to 300 words, at the final word-count of the article (and will be considered as part of the limit of ten thousand words). The keys should be followed by the credits in full.  </p>
        <p>11.	Acknowledgements and sponsoring agencies must come at the end of the article, placed before the references. </p></ul>

      <p><strong>b) Book Review  </strong></p>
     <ul> <p>&bull;	The book reviews should be between 800 and 1.000 words. Brazilian books should have been published in the same year as the submission or in the year immediately before that; foreign books should have been published within the three years before the submission.</p>
      <p> &bull;	The authors are required to address the following issues: What are the main arguments and aims of the author? Does the book develop the arguments well enough to reach its aims? Where does the work stand in the contemporary debates on the theme? Is the book supported by sound documental work and is it pertinent to the theme? What is the historiographical meaning of the book? Is the writing clear and correct? Which readers will be interested in the reviewed work: specialists, students, and the general public?  </p>
      <p>&bull;	The book reviews should bring a critical analysis of the book and shouldn't be a simple book summary. It is recommended that the reviewers do not summarize each chapter of the book, but discuss it in its general aspects.</p>
      <p>&bull;	The book reviews should have their own title (other than &quot;review&quot; or bibliographic reference), abstract and three key-words in the source language of the text and in English (when this is not the source language), citations and bibliography.</p>
      <p> &bull;	Quotations from the work being reviewed should bring the indication of the correct page, as in this example: &ldquo;We might question the dismissal of Brazilian wartime nationalism as an elite manipulation devoid of popular underpinnings&rdquo; (p.126).</p>
      <p> &bull;	Book reviews authors should be at least PhD candidates. </p>
      <p>&bull;	Book review authors should avoid situations that could be characterized as "conflict of interest".</p>
