        scientific editorial board approval, the manuscript will be analysed and 
        evaluated by two reviewers who will be kept anonymous throughout the whole 
        analysis process. The reviewed manuscript will be sent to the authors 
        for proper modifications or justifications. Only after final approval 
        by the editors and reviewers the manuscript will be published. As from 
        2012, all manuscripts from Brazilian authors will be bilingual Portuguese/English. 
        Hence, after technical review, the authors of accepted articles will receive 
        instructions regarding the translation of the manuscript into English. 
        The English version will be of the authors' full responsibility. Articles 
        that do not specifically follow the instructions will not be analyzed.

        Its structure contains: Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, 
        Abstract and References from literature. The results must be interpreted, 
        indicating statistical relevance found for the data, hence avoiding mere
