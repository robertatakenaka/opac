    <td width="70%"><p>The journal, which is mainly aimed at the academic community, welcomes scholarly articles in the most diverse  methodological and critic trends. The journal’s main areas of interest are literary studies, Brazilian literature and  comparative literature, focused on the work of Machado de Assis.</p>
      <p>Articles will be received on a rolling basis. The  articles must be original  and unpublished in Brazil. The journal receives,  reviews and publishes articles in Portuguese and English.</p>
      <p>All articles received by the editors will be submitted for evaluation by the editorial board and  by&nbsp;ad hoc reviewers, members of the Brazilian and international academic  community, who are specially invited for each issue of the journal.</p>
      <p>Every article will be assessed by two reviewers. In the case of a  discrepancy in the evaluation, the editors make the final decision. Based on the reviewers’ recommendations,  the editors will inform the authors whether  their papers were accepted for publication in each  specific issue of the journal.</p>
      <p>The texts accepted for publication are submitted to  editorial treatment and are sent to their respective authors for their final  approval.</p>
<p>Sometimes the journal publishes articles originally presented at conferences,  public talks and papers delivered at scientific  events organized or not by the journal board itself or by individual members of  the editorial board.</p>
      <p>The  editors always welcome reviews of books about the work of Machado de Assis, or  about new editions of his work.</p>

    <td width="70%"><p>The journal publishes original articles and reviews that have never been  published in Brazil, in Portuguese or in English. Articles should have  at least 20,000 and  at the most 35,000  characters, with  spaces.</p>
      <p>The file containing the article must not identify its authorship. When  citing their own works, authors are urged to do so in an impersonal fashion to  avoid being identified by the reviewers. In a separate digital document, the  author must include a bio-bibliographical note of about 600 characters that provides  academic title, affiliation, recent productions and e-mail address, all of  which will be published with the article if it is approved.</p>
      <p>Works submitted to the journal must be accompanied by titles and  abstracts in Portuguese and English  (120 words at most), as well as (three  to five) key words in Portuguese and English.</p>
      <p>All works are received by the editors and distributed for evaluation by  the members of the publication’s editorial board and by <em>ad hoc </em>peer reviewers, members of Brazilian and international  academia, who are specially invited for reviewing each issue. Every article is  evaluated by two peer reviewers and the editors are responsible for making  decisions in cases where the reviewers have a difference of opinion regarding a  text. Based on the peer reviewers’ opinions, the editors contact the authors  regarding whether their articles were accepted for publication in each specific  issue of the journal. Texts accepted for publication undergo editing and are  submitted to the respective authors for their final approval.</p>
      <p>The articles must be sent in word processing formats that are compatible  with the Windows platform. The upper and left margins of the document must be  4cm and the lower and right margins, 3 cm. The font is to be Times New Roman,  size 12, spacing between lines is to be 1.15, and paragraphs must be indented  1.0 cm from the left margin. Images should be in high resolution and JPEG format.</p>
      <p>All  of the quotations must be rigorously compared to the texts in the editions  consulted. Recommended sources for citing texts by Machado de Assis, include  critical editions by the Machado de Assis Commission (Comissão Machado de  Assis), which is published by the Instituto Nacional do Livro/ Civilização  Brasileira; editions made by a university press, or by a trustworthy commercial  publisher; the editions of the novels and short stories available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.machadodeassis.net/">www.machadodeassis.net</a>.</p>
      <p>Quotations that exceed three lines must be indented 2cm of the left margin, without quotation marks, in 11-point Times New  Roman font, with line spacing of 1 cm.  Quotations shorter than three lines (45 words) must be incorporated into the text, between quotation marks.</p>
      <p>Notes for the text will be in the form of footnotes, which include both  notes on content and bibliographical references; they must contain just the  author’s last name, the title of the work cited, and the page the citation  refers to, according to the following format:</p>
<p>1  ASSIS,&nbsp;<em>Contos</em>: uma antologia, v. 1, p. 158.<br>
