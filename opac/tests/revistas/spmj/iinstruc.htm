      <p><strong>Indexing  and scope</strong><br>
      <strong>S&atilde;o Paulo Medical  Journ</strong>al (formerly Revista Paulista de Medicina) was founded in 1932 and is now  published bimonthly by the Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Paulista de Medicina. It accepts articles  in the fields of clinical health science (internal medicine, gynecology &amp;  obstetrics, mental health, surgery, pediatrics, epidemiology and public  health). Articles will be accepted in the form of original articles, narrative  reviews, case reports, short communications and letters to the editor. Papers  with a commercial objective will not be accepted.</p>
      <p> The journal's  articles are indexed in MEDLINE,  LILACS, SciELO, Science Citation Index  Expanded, Journal Citation Reports/Science Edition (ISI) and EBSCO Publishing.</p>
      <p><strong>The  Journal's peer review policy and procedures</strong><br>
        After receipt of  the article through the electronic submission system, it will be read by the  Editorial Team, who will check whether the text complies with the journal's  Instructions for Authors. The Journal has adopted the <em>CrossRef</em><em>&nbsp;Similarity&nbsp;Check</em> system for  identifying plagiarism and any text that has been plagiarized, in whole or in  part, will be rejected.</p>
      <p> When the format of  the manuscript is deemed acceptable, the Editorial Team will submit the article  to the Editor-in-Chief who will assign at least two reviewers/referees with  expertise in the theme, to assess it. The authors will then receive the  reviewers' evaluation and will be required to provide all further information requested  and the corrections that may be necessary. Changes to the text should be  highlighted, accompanied by a letter answering the referees' comments, point by  point.</p>
      <p> Once the Editorial  Team has received the revised manuscript, the text will be sent to the Editor-in-Chief  for a decision. Manuscripts that are suitable for publication according to their  scientific merit will be considered "accepted.". However, all of them will subsequently be scrutinized to check for any problems  regarding sentence construction, spelling, grammar, bibliographical references  and other matters that may arise. The authors should contribute towards  improving the manuscript by making it as readable as possible. Lastly, the  Editorial Team will provide page proofs for the authors to approve. No article  is published without this final procedure.</p>
    <p><b>S&atilde;o Paulo Medical Journal</b> does not charge  authors for publication: there are no submission fees for the evaluation of  articles. The Journal is an open-access publication that does not charge the  readers, either. Articles accepted for publication become the journal's  property for copyright purposes, in accordance with the Creative Commons  attribution-type BY.</p></td>

      <p><strong>General guidelines: for all types of articles </strong><br>
All manuscripts  must be submitted in English with a covering letter signed by the corresponding  author. The letter must contain the following five essential items relating to  the manuscript:</p>
      <p> (1) a declaration  that the manuscript is original and that the text has not been nor will be  submitted for publication in any other journal.</p>
      <p> (2) a statement  that the manuscript has been approved by all authors, who agree to cede the  copyrights to the Journal, disclose all sources of funding and declare all  potential conflicts of interest.</p>
      <p> (3) a statement  that implementation of the study was endorsed by an Internal Review Board (Ethics  Committee), including the date and number of the approval (in the case of  original articles).</p>
      <p> (4) a brief  description of contributorship.</p>
      <p> (5) a list of a  minimum of five potential referees outside of the authors' institutions. </p>
      <p>The  Journal recommends that all articles submitted must comply with the editorial  quality standards established in the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts  Submitted to Biomedical Journals (<a href="available at www.icmje.org" target="_blank">available at www.icmje.org</a>).<sup>1</sup> This  means that each type of study must be described in accordance with the specific  quality guidelines for papers reporting on clinical trials (CONSORT),<sup>2</sup>  systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA),<sup>3,4</sup> observational  studies (STROBE),<sup>5,6</sup> case reports (CARE)<sup>7</sup> and accuracy  studies on diagnostic tests (STARD).<sup>8,9</sup></p>
      <p> Abbreviations  must not be used, even those in everyday use. Drugs or medications must be  referred to using their generic names, avoiding casual mention of commercial or  brand names. All drugs should be followed by the dosage and posology used. Any  product cited in the Methods section, such as diagnostic or therapeutic  equipment, tests, reagents, instruments, utensils, prostheses, orthoses and  intraoperative devices must be described together with the manufacturer's name  and place (city and country) of manufacture in parentheses.</p>
      <p> Grants,  bursaries and any other financial support for studies must be mentioned  separately, after the references, in a section named &#34;Acknowledgements.&#34; This  section should also be used to acknowledge any other contributions from  individuals or professionals who have helped in producing the study. The  Journal supports the position taken by the International Committee of Medical  Journal Editors (<a href="http://www.icmje.org" target="_blank">http://www.icmje.org</a>) regarding authorship. This body's  recommendations should be read to obtain clarifications regarding the criteria  for authorship.</p>
      <p> For  any manuscript, all statements in the text that do not result from the study  presented for publication in the <b>S&atilde;o Paulo Medical Journal</b> but from other  studies must be accompanied by a quotation of the source of the data. All  statements regarding health statistics and epidemiological data should generally  be followed by references to the sources that generated this information, even  if the data is only available electronically.</p>
      <p> Articles  must also include an abstract and three to five keywords in English. The  keywords must be selected from the MeSH list only, as explained in detail below  (no other keywords will be accepted).<br>
        Texts  must be submitted exclusively through the Internet, using the electronic  submission system, which is available at <a href="http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/spmj-scielo" target="_blank">http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/spmj-scielo</a>.  Submissions sent by e-mail or through the post will not be accepted.</p>
      <p><strong>Authorship </strong><br>
        Authors of  articles published in <b>S&atilde;o Paulo Medical Journal</b> should all have contributed  actively to the discussion of the study results and should review and approve  the final version to be released. The corresponding author is the primary  guarantor of all ethical issues relating to the manuscript, before, during and  after its publication. However, <b>S&atilde;o Paulo Medical Journal</b> considers that all  authors are held fully responsible for the study, regarding the accuracy or  integrity of data and data interpretation in the text.</p>
<p>All authors should  create an ORCID iD record (in <a href="www.orcid.org" target="_blank">www.orcid.org</a>) before submitting their article and link the  submission to their existing ORCID ID in the electronic submission system.  ORCID identifications help to distinguish researchers with similar names.</p>
    During submission, the authors will be asked to  indicate the names of three to five referees. All of them should be from  outside the institution where they work and at least two should preferably be  from outside Brazil. <b>S&atilde;o Paulo Medical Journal</b> does not charge authors for  publication.</td>

      <p><em>References</em><br>
        S&atilde;o Paulo Medical  Journal uses the reference style known as the "Vancouver style," as recommended  by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). Follow the  instructions and examples at www.icmje.org, item &quot;References&quot;, for  the format. In the text, the references must be numbered in  the order of citation. The citation numbers must be inserted after periods/full  stops or commas in sentences, and in superscript (without parentheses or square  brackets). References cited in the legends of tables and figures must maintain  sequence with the references mentioned in the text.</p>
      <p>The reference list should be inserted after the  conclusions and before the tables and figures. In the list of  references, all the authors must be listed if there are up to and including  five authors; if there are six or more, the first three should be cited,  followed by the expression "et al." For books, the city of publication and the  name of the publishing house are mandatory. For texts published on the  internet, the complete uniform resource locator (URL) or address is necessary  (not only the main home page of a website or link), so that by copying the  complete address into a computer internet browser, the journal's readers will  be taken to the exact document cited, and not to a general website. </p>
      <p>In the end of  each reference, please insert the &quot;PMID&quot; number (for papers indexed  in Pubmed) and the &quot;doi&quot; number if available.<br>
        <br>
Authors are  responsible for providing a complete and accurate list of references, so that  all references cited in the text must appear in the reference list, and every  item in the reference list must be cited in text. Also, citations must be in  the correct sequence.</p>
The reference list should be inserted after the conclusions and before  the tables and figures.
      <p><em>Figures  and tables</em><br>
      Images must be  submitted at a minimum size that is reproducible in the printed edition.  Figures should be sent a resolution of 300 DPI and/or minimum size of 2500 pixels  (width) and be recorded in ".jpg" or ".tif" format. Do not attach images inside  Microsoft PowerPoint or Microsoft Word documents. Failure to send the original  images at appropriate sizes leads to paper rejection before peer review.</p>
      <p> Graphs must be  prepared in Microsoft Excel (do not send them in image formats) and spreadsheets be  accompanied by the tables of data from which they have been generated.</p>
      <p> All the figures  and tables should be cited in the text.</p>
      <p>All figures and  tables must contain legends or titles that precisely describe their content and  the context or sample from which the information was obtained (i.e. what the  results presented are and what the kind of sample or setting was). The reader  should be able to understand the content of the figures and tables simply by  reading the titles (without the need to consult the text), i.e. titles should  be complete.</p>
      <p> For figures relating  to microscopic findings (i.e. histopathological results), a scale must be  embedded to indicate the magnification used. The staining agent should be  specified in the figure legend.</p>
      <p><strong>Original articles </strong><br>
        Clinical trials;  cohort, case-control, prevalence, incidence, accuracy and cost-effectiveness  studies; case series (i.e. case reports on more than three patients analyzed  together); and systematic reviews with or without meta-analysis, are considered  to be full-text original articles, with a maximum of 3000 words.</p>
<p>Short  communications are reports on the results from ongoing studies or studies that  have recently been concluded for which urgent publication is important. They  should be structured in the same way as original articles.</p>
<p>Short communications  and case reports must be limited to 1000 words (from the introduction to the  end of the conclusion). The abstracts in short communications should not be  structured and have a maximum of 100 words. </p>
        <p>Authors will be  required to comply with the guidelines for writing each type of original  article, as follows:</p>
      <p> 1. Observational  articles: STROBE Statement<sup>5,6</sup> <br>
        2. Clinical  trials: CONSORT Statement<sup>2</sup><br>
        3. Accuracy  studies on diagnostic tests: STARD Statement<sup>8,9</sup> <br>
        4. Systematic  reviews of the literature and meta-analyses: PRISMA<sup>4</sup><br>
        5. Case reports:  CARE<sup>7</sup></p>
      <p>S&atilde;o Paulo Medical  Journal supports the clinical trial registration policies of the World Health  Organization (WHO) and the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors  (ICMJE) and recognizes the importance of these initiatives for registration and  international dissemination of information on randomized clinical trials, with  open access. Thus, since 2008, manuscripts on clinical trials have only been  accepted for publication if they have received an identification number from  one of the clinical trial registers (the options are stated at  <a href="http://www.icmje.org" target="_blank">http://www.icmje.org</a>). The identification number should be declared at the end  of the abstract. Articles describing  systematic reviews must provide the protocol registration number in the  PROSPERO database. Authors of randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews must thus register their  studies before submitting them for publication in the S&atilde;o Paulo Medical  Journal.</p>
      <p> Results from cases  with DNA sequences must be deposited in appropriate public databases. The  protocol number or URL can be requested at any time during the editorial review.  Publication of other research data in public repositories is also recommended,  since it contributes towards replicability of research, increases article  visibility and possibly improves access to health information.</p>
      <p><strong>Short communications, case reports, case series and  narrative reviews </strong><br>
        Short  communications and case reports must be limited to 1000 words (from the  introduction to the end of the conclusion), a maximum of five references and  one figure or table. They should be structured in the same way as original  articles. Individual case reports should contain the following sections:  Introduction, Case Report, Discussion and Conclusion. Reports on case series  constitute observational studies and these should be structured in accordance  with the norms of the STROBE Statement.<sup>5</sup></p>
      <p> Both short  communications and case reports must be submitted with abstracts and keywords.  The abstracts in short communications should not be structured and have a  maximum of 100 words.</p>
      <p> The S&atilde;o Paulo  Medical Journal is interested in publishing rare or instructive case reports,  accompanied by a systematic search of the literature, in which relevant studies  found (based on their level of evidence) are presented and discussed.<sup>11</sup>  The search strategy for each database and the number of articles obtained from  each database should be shown in a table. The access route to the electronic  databases used should be stated (for example, PubMed, OVID, Elsevier or  Bireme). For the search strategies, MeSH terms must be utilized for Medline,  LILACS, and Cochrane Library. DeCS terms must be used for LILACS. EMTREE terms  must be used for Embase. Also, for LILACS, the search strategy must be conducted  using English (MeSH), Spanish (DeCS) and Portuguese (DeCS) terms concomitantly.  The search strategies must be presented exactly as they were used during the  search, including parentheses, quotation marks and Boolean operators (AND, OR,  and NOT) the search dates should be indicated in the text  or in the table.</p>
      <p> Narrative reviews  may be accepted by the <b>S&atilde;o Paulo Medical Journal</b> provided that a systematic  search is made, and they should be structured as Original Articles. The search  strategy and results should be presented as described above for case reports.  By invitation from the Editor-in-Chief, narrative reviews addressing historical  personal or collective experiences relating to clinical health sciences,  epidemiology and public health may be accepted, but with no more than two  authors.</p>
      <p> Individual  case reports should contain Introduction, Case Report, Discussion and  Conclusion. Case reports should be structured in accordance with the norms of  the CARE Statements.<sup>7 </sup>Case reports published in S&atilde;o Paulo Medical  Journal must be submitted with abstracts and keywords.</p>
      <p><strong>Letters to the editor</strong></p>
    Letters to the editor may address articles  published in the <b>S&atilde;o Paulo Medical Journal</b> publication or may deal with health  issues of interest. Case reports must not be submitted as letters. In the  category of letters to the editor, the text has a free format, but must not  exceed 500 words and five references.</td>
