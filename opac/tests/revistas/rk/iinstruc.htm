      <p>Revista Kat&aacute;lysis is dedicated to the publication of  work about current and important issues in the realm of Social Work, related fields and those with  common interdisciplinary interests. Each edition focuses on a single theme that  is previously defined by the Editorial Commission, considering its importance  in the contemporary social context, but reserves space for works about other topics, as long as they  are related to Social Work.<br>
        <br>
        Papers submitted for publication must have never been published, and they may  not be presented simultaneously to another journal, including its text, tables and  illustrations.<br>
        <br>
        Each issue of Revista Kat&aacute;lysis gives priority to the  publication of scientific  research articles that  are relevant to is  theme. <br>
        <br>
        Manuscripts  submitted to publication will be sent to external reviewers only after a  preliminary analysis, conducted by members of the Editorial Commission, in  which the following will be rated: adequacy to Revista Kat&aacute;lysis&rsquo; objectives  and editorial policy, presentation format and publication potential. <br>
        <br>
        Revista  Kat&aacute;lysis&rsquo; criteria to the acceptance of manuscripts include: originality,  validity of data, clarity of writing, implications of the findings and  scientific contribution to Social Work and related areas. Each manuscript is  reviewed by to external peers that will assess and make punctual and general  comments regarding the manuscript&rsquo;s scientific merit, arbitrating for its  acceptance, rejection and suggesting reformulations. <br>
        <br>
        During the analysis  the following will be  considered: rigor,  clarity and precision regarding  the scientific production, the writing quality, the methodological description, the content and the  ethical-theoretical probity. Any modifications to the structure and content  will be forwarded to  the authors. No additions or alterations to the text will be accepted after its final evaluation and  acceptance.<br>
        <br>
        Editors and the  Editorial Commission, in possession of the reviews, will take the final  decision based on the journal&rsquo;s editorial program. In case of discrepancies  between reviewers, more reviews may be requested. Editors will transmit the  final decision to the author through Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina&rsquo;s  Journal Portal. <br>
        <br>
        The Editorial Commission assures authors&rsquo; anonymity in the evaluation  process, as well as  ensures to the evaluators that  their participation will be classified, allowing freedom of judgment and  evaluations.<br>
        <br>
        Revista Kat&aacute;lysis publishes papers in Portuguese, Spanish and English.<br>
        <br>
        The journal translates  to English the editorial, the abstract of all manuscripts and, at the  discretion of the Editorial Commission, the totality of one or more  manuscripts. <br>
        <br>
        Authorship  imputes credit and implicates in responsibility to the content published.  Therefore, opinions and concepts issued in the manuscripts, as well as  accuracy, adequacy and provenance of citations and references, are the sole  responsibility of the author(s), not depicting, necessarily, the Editorial  Commission&rsquo;s position. <br>
        <br>
        Submission of a manuscript to the journal for review implies the  acceptance by the author(s) of the rules presented here.<br>
        <br>
      Revista Kat&aacute;lysis does not remunerate authors who have  their manuscripts published  in the journal. </p>
      <p><br>
        <strong>Research and Publication Ethics</strong><strong><br>
        </strong><br>
        To the  researchers, authors, editors and reviewers, beyond the ethical precepts, apply  the standards of conduct that accrue from the purpose of their profession: the  collective construction and appropriation of science. These rules define the  ethical integrity of the scientific activities and may be deduced from one  cornerstone: every scientist must exercise her or his profession in the most suitable  way in order that results the advance and socialization of science in a public  manner. <br>
        <br>
        The journal is  convinced that the conjugation of researchers, research institutions, authors,  editors and reviewers&rsquo; efforts will succeed in maintaining the propagation of  the scientific research accordingly with ethical integrity standards. <br>
        <br>
        Revista  Kat&aacute;lysis is deeply concerned about Research Integrity, Science and Publication  Ethics, and, therefore, recommends to the authors, reviewers, and editors, the  study of the following basic guidelines concerning the integrity of the  scientific activity and publications: </p>

<p><strong>Anti-Plagiarism Policy</strong><br>
  <br>
  Before being sent to the Editorial  Commission, to  external reviewers or at any moment during the editorial process,  manuscripts submitted  to Revista Kat&aacute;lysis  will be checked by an anti-plagiarism software. Authors must ensure the  originality of their  manuscripts, and if  works from other  authors are used they must  be cited properly.  To practice  plagiarism, or  self-plagiarism, in all its forms, is unacceptable. Thus, it&rsquo;s possible that the  authors receive eventual  inquiries during the evaluation  process of the work submitted, regarding to the indications pointed by the used software. If plagiarism is actually proved, the manuscript will be  returned to the author(s). </p>

1) <strong>Microsoft Word</strong> must be used with the following formatting: font <strong>Times New Roman</strong> size <strong>12</strong>,  paper size <strong>A4</strong>, <strong>1.5 lines </strong>line spacing,&nbsp;all  margins with <strong>2.5 cm</strong>.<br>
<br>
2) Length,  title, abstract and keywords in the language of the manuscript:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>Titles may have, at most, 12 words;</li>
       <li>Abstract, written in third person, must be  informative, with about 150 words, and shall exhibit, with clarity and  synthesis, the work&rsquo;s objective, methodology, structure and relevant results;</li>
       <li>Keywords: 3 to 5 that are really descriptive of the  work&rsquo;s focus, separated from each other with a dot;</li>
       <li>Manuscripts with at most 15 pages.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>3) The main body of the manuscripts must contain  topics that correspond to an introduction, development and conclusion. The  introduction must consist of a presentation of the manuscript and a briefly  problematization of the theme/object. Just like of a justification for why the  theme was chosen, the objectives of the manuscript and methodology, the theoretical  framework, the chosen theoretical-methodological perspectives and finally to  show how the work is structured and presented. We remind that both in the  introduction and conclusion the number of citations must be drastically low,  given that these items are essentially spaces for the construction and  elaboration of the authors themselves.<br>
       <br>
       4) Tables and frames must be presented in editable  text and in Microsoft Word. <br>
       <br>

       <br>
       8) Authorship&rsquo;s  identification <strong>MUST NOT</strong> be presented  in any part of the manuscript, assuring the blind peer review process adopted  by this journal.<br>
       <br>
       9) Authors must warrant that they participated in the conception  of the work, partially or wholly, that no bounds or financial agreements  between the authors and institutions that might be interested in the  publication are omitted. Must also assure that the manuscript is original and  that the same work, partially or wholly, or any other work of their authorship  with substantially similar content, wasn&rsquo;t submitted to another journal and  won&rsquo;t be while its submission is been considered by Revista Kat&aacute;lysis.<br>
       <br>
       10) If it&rsquo;s the case of a research developed with  public or private funding this must be mentioned at the end of the work, naming  the funding agency in full, project or protocol number and execution period.<br>
