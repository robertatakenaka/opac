      <p><b>Aims and scope</b></p>

      <p>Revista de Psiquiatria do Rio Grande do Sul (RPRS) is a peer-reviewed, 

        multidisciplinary journal that assures rapid publication of research papers 

        and authoritative reviews focusing on the&nbsp;interaction between experimental 

        and clinical research in the field of psychiatry and mental health. Other 

        types of articles whose primary focus is to help translate fundamental 

        discoveries from basic research into the reality of clinical psychiatric 

        practice will also be considered (see list of types of articles accepted 

        below). These may include papers on psychological processes and behavior, 

        neuropsychology, psychopharmacology, clinical neuroscience, psychotherapy, 

        and other areas of relevance to one or more aspects of psychopathology 

        and psychiatry.</p>

      <p>The journal aims to publish&nbsp;current and original research covering 

        the broad spectrum of clinical psychiatry and basic science, produced 

        by expert national and international bodies.</p>

      <p>RPRS is published four-monthly and is the official scientific publication 

        of Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o de Psiquiatria do Rio Grande do Sul (APRS, Brazil).&nbsp;</p>

      <p>These instructions were written based on the Uniform Requirements for 

        Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals: Writing and Editing for 

        Biomedical Publication, edited by the International Committee of Medical 

        Journal Editors (ICMJE). The original document is available at <a href="http://www.icmje.org/" target="_blank">http://www.icmje.org/</a>.</p>

      <p>RPRS supports the clinical trial registration policies of the World Health 

        Organization (WHO) and the ICMJE, recognizing the importance of such initiatives 

        for the registration and disclosure of trial results to the international 

        community through open access. According to this recommendation and to 

        the BIREME/OPAS/OMS guidelines for journals indexed in the LILACS and 

        SciELO databases, RPRS will only accept for publication clinical trials 

        that have been registered in Clinical Trials Registries that meet the 

        WHO and ICMJE requirements (URLs available at <a href="http://www.icmje.org/faq.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.icmje.org/faq.pdf</a>). 

        The clinical trial registration number should be informed at the end of 

        the abstract.</p>

      <p><b>Language<br>

        </b>Preference will be given to manuscripts written in English. Manuscripts 

        written in Portuguese may also be submitted but will be translated into 

        English upon acceptance for publication. Translation costs will be the 

        responsibility of the authors. Only manuscripts written in clear and understandable 

        language will be sent to peer review.</p>

        system, available at <a href="http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rprs" target="_blank">http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/rprs</a>. 

        Registration (login and password) is required on first access, prior to 

        submission.</p>

      <p>The submission system has several required fields and also some optional 

        fields. One of the required fields is related to the indication of potential 

        reviewers for the submitted manuscript. Authors should inform the name, 

        email address and affiliation of five preferred reviewers, i.e., experts 

        in the field who do not have conflicts of interest that may impede them 

        from revising the authors' work (for example, indicated reviewers should 

        not be from the same institutions as authors). The final decision on the 

        reviewers invited to analyze each manuscript lies with the editors.</p>

      <p>For system support and information on the status of submitted manuscripts,

      by the editors with regard to conformity between the manuscript content 

      and the journal's editorial line. If the paper is in accordance with the 

      editorial policies of the journal and with the present Instructions to Authors, 

      it will be referred to analysis by at least two reviewers selected by the 

      editors; the reviewers remain anonymous throughout the review process. Within 

      60 days, the authors are informed of either acceptance, rejection, or need 

      for revisions in the article, as requested by the Editorial Board. A decision 

      letter and the reviewers' comments are e-mailed to the authors. Manuscripts 

      requiring revision are returned to the authors for correction. Authors are 

      requested to return a revised version of the manuscript within 30 days and 

      to provide a letter with detailed responses to each of the reviewers' comments. 

      Failure to re-submit the article within 30 days will cause the paper to 

      be withdrawn from the submission system. Revised manuscripts are sent back 

      to reviewers for reassessment. At this time, a new decision is made, for 

      either the acceptance, rejection, or need for additional revision. Based 

      on the reviewers' comments, the editors make the final decision.</td>
