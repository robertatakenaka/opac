      <p>The scope of the journal is to cover topics involving  the following fields of knowledge: hydraulics, hydrology, relationship between water  resources and environmental engineering, hydrometeorology, irrigation, drainage,  qualitative and quantitative management of water, limnology, hydrogeology, erosion,  sedimentation, environmental technologies, water resources economics, measurement  and instrumentation in water resources.</p>
<p> Manuscripts can be submitted in Portuguese or English.  Papers are published in English, and should contain Title, Abstract and Keywords  in Portuguese. The translation of papers to English of accepted papers written in  Portuguese is of the authors responsibility.</p>
      <p> The manuscript should be sent by internet to the  following address: http://www.abrh.org.br/RBRH according to the instructions for  use, omitting the names of the authors and footnotes identifying them in the manuscript  file. Besides the identification of the authors via the system, it is requested  that (also via the system) the file be sent in Doc with the complete name and affiliation  of the authors. This information will be used if the article is accepted for publication.  The author must agree to the following conditions (via the system) when the manuscript  is sent:<br>
        1) Commit to paying a deposit concerning for the  fee charged per exceeding page, if any, after the review and final editing of the  manuscript;</p>
      <p> 2) Take responsibility for the other authors, if  any, as co-responsible for the technical and scientific content of the article,  according to Article 5 of Brazilian Law N. 9610, regarding Copyright</p>
      <p><strong>Copyright</strong><strong> </strong></p>
      <p>The authors are fully responsible for all  statements published in the article. All the material published becomes the  property of the RBRH, which then holds the copyright and will be available with  free and unrestricted access at: ABRH (www.abrh.org.br/RBRH) and SciELO  (www.scielo.br) or other databases where the RBRH - Brazilian Journal of Water  Resources is or eventually becomes indexed. Total or  partial reproduction of the work is allowed since the original work is  explicitly referred.If the manuscript is accepted for publication, a copyright transfer  agreement form to RBRH/ABRH will be requested from the authors</p>
<p> The manuscripts subdivided into parts I, II, etc,  must be registered separately, but will be submitted to the same reviewers. The  manuscripts may contain figures in color (pictures, graphs, plots, and other), but  the maximum permissible size of the complete file is 30Mb (Megabytes). Manuscripts  that do not follow these guidelines will be returned to the authors to correct the  problems. The classification of manuscripts sent as Scientific/Technical, and that  Editors and/or Reviewers interpret as being in the style of a Technical Note should  be altered, and they will be reevaluated if alterations are requested. If the authors  do not agree with the change to the Technical Note, the manuscript will be rejected.</p>
      <p><strong>Processing and  Peer Review system/ Criteria for refereeing</strong></p>
      <p>The manuscripts are sent to two reviewers for evaluation  and should present a technical and scientific contribution to the community.</p>
      <p> The manuscripts should be submitted through the  RBRH&rsquo;s electronic system for manuscript submission at http://www.editorialmanager.com/rbrh,  where the author responsible will be informed, as well as all the data for the identification  of the co-authors. The manuscript received will be treated according to the procedures  established by the Journal Editorial Board.</p>
      <p> The manuscript-reviewing process in the RBRH is  meticulous. Voluntary reviewers apply their knowledge and dedicate many hours of  their precious time to ensure that the articles will be published within a defined  period and will be appropriate for publication in the Journal.</p>
      <p> Technical review: The papers will be evaluated first  as to compliance with the rules of publication and documentation required to submit  the manuscripts. If they are not in accordance with the instructions, they will  be returned to the authors to adapt them to the scope of the journal. If the manuscript  is not within the expected parameters, it will be returned to the corresponding  author by the Chief Editor.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
        Pre-analysis: the manuscripts approved by the technical  review will be submitted to the Associate Editors for appreciation regarding their  adequacy to the scope of the journal. If the manuscript is not within the expected  parameters it will be returned to the corresponding author by the Chief Editor.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
        Analysis of merit and content: the manuscripts approved  by the Associate Editors will be evaluated for merit and scientific method by at  least two ad-hoc reporters from units that are not those from which the paper comes,  besides the Chief Editor. The Chief Editor will decide whether the manuscript will  be accepted. When the original has to be revised, the manuscript will be returned  to the corresponding author for modification. A revised version with the changes  made will be re-submitted by the authors and reevaluated by the Chief Editor, Associate  Editors and reviewers as needed. The manuscripts that have been refused, but which  could possibly be reformulated can return as a new paper, beginning another judgment  process.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
        After approval regarding scientific merit, the papers  will be submitted to a final review by an independent professional appointed by  the journal. This service will be paid for by the author(s), and the necessary procedure,  the value of the service and the form of payment of the professional will be sent  to the corresponding author. If they are not adequate, the papers will be sent to  the authors for revision.</p>
      <p>The concepts issue in the papers published will  be the exclusive responsibility of the authors and are not obliged to reflect the  opinion of the Chief Editor or Editorial Board.</p>
      <p><strong>Editorial Board</strong><br>
        The editorial board of the RBRH comprises the Chief  Editor, Associate Editors and Executive Editor (Look at Editorial Board). The Executive  Editor is the main person responsible for following the manuscript review process  at the RBRH, inviting Reviewers and informing Authors, and thus helping the Associate  Editors in the process. The Chief Editor, besides establishing guidelines for the  RBRH is also involved in polemical cases and analyzing appeals by authors regarding  the Editorial Decision.</p>
      <p><strong>Appeals against  an Editorial Decision</strong><br>
        The author(s) can appeal an Editorial Decision to  reject a manuscript. This procedure should be performed via the system using the  option &ldquo;Send E-mail&rdquo;, for the rejected manuscript. The authors should supply elements  that justify the appeal which will be analyzed by the Associate Editor and Chief  Editor. If the appeal is accepted, the manuscript review process may be re-opened.</p>
      <p>  <strong>Submission Fee</strong> <br>
        For the values presented below, the  corresponding author of the papers is considered for the classification at each  category of the submission fee</p>
      <ol start="1" type="a">
        <li>Submission       fee for members: R$120,00</li>
        <li>Submission       fee for non-members: R$300,00</li>
        <li>Discount       for authors who have collaborated as RBRH reviewers in three or more       reviews in 12 months: 50% of the amount of the fee corresponding to the       category to which they belong.</li>
        <li>International       authors (non-residents of Brazil)  and work was completed at an&nbsp;<strong>International Institution</strong> will be exempt from the submission fee until the       end of 2017.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The payments should be  performed by Credit Card or bank slip issued by the ABRH system.</p>
      <p> The process of evaluation  will begin only after the payment is identified by the ABRH system.</p>
      <p> This process is automatic,  and the author does not have to do anything.</p>
      <p> The submission fee will not  be returned if the manuscript is rejected for publication by the RBRH.</p>
      No processing&nbsp;charges (APCs) are applied  after the manuscript is accepted.
      <p>RBRH adopts the &nbsp;"Crossref Similarity Check"&nbsp;system offered by SciELO for plagiarism identification.</p>

      <p><strong>Scientific/Technical Article</strong> </p>
      <p>This refers to the report on an original research,  with a well defined hypothesis, favoring innovative topics. The texts should cover  the items highlighted in capital letters and in bold, without a paragraph and without  numbering, leaving two spaces (twice ENTER) after the previous item and one space  (a single ENTER) to begin the text in the following order: title (English), name  of authors; abstract, keywords; title (Portuguese), resumo and palavras chave. To  make sure that peer analysis will be blind, the papers submitted should be presented  without authors and footnotes.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
        TITLE: Centered; it should be clear and concise,  allowing immediate identification of the article content, trying to avoid words  such as: analysis, study and evaluation. The manuscripts should present the title  in English andPortuguese , enabling the presentation of a bilingual summary.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
        AUTHORS: The number of authors should be the minimum  possible, considering only people who actually participated in the article and are  able to answer for it fully or in essential parts. The authors must present complete  affiliation, indicating the institution, city, state and country. When necessary,  the Editorial Board may request justifications to explain the presence of the authors  in the paper, as well as present the indication of the contribution made by each  author. The authors will be identified in the paper sent for evaluation. The editors  will remove the authors&rsquo; names before sending them to the reviewers, and the information  will only be inserted into the articles after the paper is approved.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
        ABSTRACT: The text must begin on the second line  after the item, it should be clear, concise and must explain the intended objective(s)  seeking to justify their importance (without including references), the main procedures  adopted, the most significant results and conclusions, with a maximum of 12 lines.  Below it, on the second line after the item, should appear the KEYWORDS (at most  six trying not to repeat the words in the title), written in small caps and bold.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>INTRODUCTION: This presents the topic to be discussed,  its objectives and purposes, informing what methods were used, precise delimitation  of the research in relation to the field of knowledge, periods covered, and other  elements needed to situate the topic of the work, using recent bibliography (last  5 years) and, preferably periodicals.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
        MATERIAL AND METHODS: Depending on the nature  of the work, a characterization of the experimental area must be inserted, clarifying  the conditions under which the study was performed. When the methods are specifically  known to be used, the reference alone will be enough, otherwise it is necessary  to describe the procedures used and the adaptations made. Units of measure and symbols  must follow the International System of Units. <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
        RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Illustrations (figures,  charts and photographs, etc.) must be presented with sufficient size and details  for the final composition, preferably in the same position in the text, and may  be colored. Illustrations can have parts that are colored, and the caption below.  They must be numbered successively with Arabic numerals. Tables: avoid long tables  with superfluous data, adapt their sizes to the workspace of the paper and, as far  as possible, place only horizontal continuous lines; their captions should be concise  and self-explanatory, and should also present the title in English. Photographs  can be colored. In the discussion compare the results with the data obtained in  the bibliography.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
        CONCLUSIONS: They should be based only on the  results of the study. Avoid repeating the results in a subsequent listing, seeking  to compare what was obtained with the initial objectives established. The conclusions  should be written making it easier to interpret the article without the need to  consult other items of the same.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
        ACKNOWLEDGMENT(S): insert it (them) when necessary  concisely, after the conclusions.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
        REFERENCES: The references should be placed in  alphabetic order and in capital letters, and normalized according to standard NBR-6023  Aug.2000) of the ABNT (Brazilian Association of Technical Norms). All authors mentioned  in the text and in tables, figures or illustrations should be referenced. Avoid  citations of abstracts, unpublished papers and personal communications. It is suggested  that at least 70% of the references be from the last 5 years and 70% from articles  and periodicals.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
        CITATIONS: All citations in the text should be  in the list of References. The citations in the text should appear in small letters  and, when inserted between parentheses at the end of the paragraph, should be in  capital letters. If there are other citations of the same author(s), in the same  year (other publications), they will be identified by small letters (a, b, c), after  the year of publication. When there are three or more authors only the first author  will be cited in the text, followed by et al, without italics, but in the final  bibliographic list, the other names should also appear. When making a citation the  work consulted directly is identified: the author and/or the work cited in this  is indicated as follows: SILVA(2010) <em>apud</em> Santos (2012). If there are any  doubts, consult the NBR-6023 standard of ABNT. It is advisable that before drafting  the manuscript, the authors take an article published in the last issue of the journal  as a formatting base.<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  <strong>Technical Note</strong> <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
        It must present technological advances without  presenting a hypothesis. When it is a case study, the conclusions should present  propositions. It should be written in technical language, easy to understand, on  an issue related to the fields of knowledge covered by the Journal, by author(s)  showing experience on the subject matter, providing guidance for the different RBRH  users. Only the presentation of articles that contribute to the subject is justified,  not simply personal cases or cases with a limited interest. There is greater freedom&nbsp; of style than for scientific articles, and technical  notes should mostly contain the following items: Title, Author(s), Abstract, Keywords,  Introduction, Description of the Subject, Conclusions and References. The authors&rsquo;  identification will be included only after the article is accepted for publication.  The articles must be written according to the same guidelines for Scientific Articles,  with the following particularities;<br>
      The header of the first page should show the identification::  TECHNICAL NOTE,&nbsp; in capital letters, underlined,  bold, centered and spaced 1.1 cm from the top margin.</p>
      <p> INTRODUCTION:&nbsp;  should contain a brief history, explaining the importance, the current status  of the subject based on a review of literature, clearly presenting the purpose of  the article.</p>
      <p> DESCRIPTION OF THE SUBJECT: with different titles  that can be divided into sub-items, one should discuss the subject, pointing out  the theoretical bases, presenting experiences and recommendations, discussing and  critiquing situations, based as much as possible on bibliography and technical standards.</p>
      <p> CONCLUSIONS: when appropriate, they should be  written clearly and concisely, consistent with the goals set.&nbsp; It should not be a simple restatement simply presenting  the other paragraphs of the article again.
