  <strong>The receipt of a manuscript with the English usage considered  inappropriate can lead to the return of the paper to the authors even before  the beginning of the review process.</strong></p>
<p>
  In January 2016, the<strong>&nbsp;Revista do  Instituto de Medicina Tropical de S&atilde;o Paulo&nbsp;</strong>established a fee per  published article. Beginning on January the 1st, 2016, all the submitted  articles will be charged if they are accepted for publication.</p>
<p> These publication fees will supplement public  funding from the&nbsp;<em>Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo</em>&nbsp;and other grants  from foundations of the State of&nbsp;<em>S&atilde;o Paulo,&nbsp;</em>as well as from  federal supporting agencies. This additional support is essential to ensure  quality, the increment of the journal&rsquo;s impact fator and number of citations,  the maintenance of the electronic&nbsp;<em>manuscript&nbsp;</em>submission and  review system, the review of the English style and of grammar issues.</p>
<p> The fees will be of US$400 for original articles  and reviews; and of US$250 for case reports, technical reports, brief  communications and letters to the editor, provided that the number of pages are  in accordance with the type of article. Only for Brazilian citizens the fees  will be of BRL 1,500.00 for original articles and reviews; and of BRL 1,000.00  for case reports, brief communications and letters to the editor. Once the  manuscript has been approved,&nbsp;<em>t</em>he corresponding author will receive  the instructions for the payment of the publication fee. Thereafter, the  corresponding author will receive the proof of payment to be able to apply for  funding agencies reimbursement.</p>
<p> All types of manuscripts should be sent to  the Editor of the&nbsp;<strong>Revista do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de S&atilde;o  Paulo</strong>&nbsp;and they&nbsp;<strong>will be peer-reviewed by two or three reviewers  of the Editorial Board and/or&nbsp;<em>ad hoc</em>&nbsp;reviewers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The decision of acceptance for publication lies with the Editors and is  mainly based on the recommendations of these reviewers.</strong></p>
<p> A form stating the following items should be  sent to the Editorial Office signed by the corresponding author: 1) The  manuscript and all parts of it have not been submitted elsewhere; 2) There are  no financial or other relationships of any of the authors of the manuscript  that might lead to any conflict of interest; 3) The submitted manuscript has  been read by all authors carefully. All authors agree that the manuscript  represents their work. 4) Describe sources of funding that have supported the  work. Please also describe the role of the study sponsor(s), if any, in study  design; collection, analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the paper;  and decision to submit it for publication; 5) The corresponding author is  indicated below and will be responsible for the communication with the other  authors about revisions and final approval of the paper. The manuscripts will  be received only by online submission at:<a href="http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/rimtsp-scielo" target="_blank">http://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/rimtsp-scielo</a></p>
<p>
  At the same site the authors can check the  status of the submission any time. The electronic file will be used for  editorial assessment and online refereeing, and the editorial decisions on the  manuscript will be communicated to the corresponding author. <strong>Only the corresponding author will be  contacted and always by e-mail, so be sure to designate an author who checks  frequently the e-mail account.</strong></p>
Authors may suggest  potential reviewers for their work provided that they give the e-mail address  and affiliation of each scientist they have proposed. Please do not sugest  scientists of the same affiliations of the authors.</td>

      <p><strong>Types of  articles:</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Original  Articles: </strong>The text must  contain a maximum of 6,000 words including abstract and references. The body of  the manuscript should be preceded by a nonstructured abstract (with no sub-headings), with a maximum of 500 words. Then, authors should  proceed to sections of Introduction, Material and Methods (containing the  research&rsquo;s ethical approval) Results, Discussion, Acknowledgments and  References (limited to 40). Pages should be numbered consecutively in Arabic  numerals. Tables and figures should be referred to in the text. Tables and  figures should be numbered and contain a brief specific title. Figures such as  drawings, photographs, photomicrographs or electron micrographs should be  planned to suit the size of a single or double page column. Figures (graphs)  should be submitted in TIF format, in high resolution (1,200 DPI). Other types  of images, in black or white or in color art should have a minimum of 600 DPI. </p>
      <p><strong>Review  Articles: </strong>Should be presented  in the same format of original articles. <strong>Review  articles a</strong>re intended to investigators who are experts in a  certain field and have made substantial contributions to this specific area of  knowledge. This type of manuscript should focus on the description of the state  of art, highlighting the major breakthroughs regarding the subject. The number  of references are limited to 60. </p>
      <p><strong>Brief  Communications, Case Reports and Letters to the Editor:</strong>&nbsp;Should report new observations of critical  medical importance. <strong>Brief  Communications </strong>should follow the same format of original  articles, not exceeding 2,500 words. Case Reports should focus on clinical and  laboratory findings, summarizing the introduction, limiting discussion to the  essential, calling attention to novelties regarding diagnosis, treatment,  outcome of patients, not exceeding 2,000 words. Letters to the Editor should  state, from the beginning, why the subject merits this type of publication,  highlighting the innovative aspects attained by the research, not exceeding  1,500 words. In these three categories of manuscripts <strong>(<strong>Brief  Communications, Case Reports and Letters to the Editor), the number of  references is limited to 20. Brief Communications and Letters to the Editor  must not exceed 3 attachments, which may be figures (photographs, maps,  graphics) and/ or tables. </strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Acknowledgments: </strong>Should be brief, and should not include  thanks to anonymous referees and editors, or effusive comments. Private or  Governmental organizations that have provided financial support to the research  should be mentioned, together with the grants or contribution numbers and  period of validity. </p>
      <p><strong>Authors&rsquo; Contributions:</strong>&nbsp;The <em><strong>Revista  do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de São Paulo</strong></em>&nbsp;encourages  authors to include a statement to specify the individual contributions of each  co-author. This statement will be published under a separate subheading named  &quot;Authors&rsquo; contributions&quot;, following the &ldquo;Acknowledgments&rdquo;. As the <em><strong>Revista do Instituto de Medicina  Tropical de São Paulo</strong></em> reviewers work blindly, the &ldquo;authors&rsquo;  contributions&rdquo; must not be included in the main text of the manuscript, but in  the &ldquo;title page&rdquo;. This statement will be included in the body of the text on  the final version of the article.</p>
      <p> <strong>References:</strong><br>
        The list of&nbsp;references,  including only those actually mentioned in the text or tables, should be in <strong>Vancouver format, listed in order of the  citation on the text</strong>, and numbered consecutively in Arabic numerals  followed by a dot. <strong>The citations on the  text must be in superscript format, only the numbers without parentheses.</strong><br>

        <strong>The&nbsp;<em>Revista do  Instituto de Medicina Tropical de São Paulo </em>will not accept the citation of  master of Science, PhD thesis, or similar work.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Ethical Guidelines:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Papers must state in the Material and Methods section that: 1)  informed consent was obtained from all human adult participants and from  parents or legal guardians of minors together with the approved consent of the  Ethical Commission 2) a consent term was applied to study participants in the  case of children over the age of seven and adolescents besides the consent  obtained from parents or legal guardians of minors together with the approved  consent of the Ethical Commission 3) the maintenance of experimental animals  complies with the guidelines of the use of laboratory animals prevailing in the  country.</p>
      <p>        <strong>Numbers:</strong> </p>
      <p>Numbers that begin a sentence or  those that are less than 10 should be spelled out using letters. Centuries and decades should be spelled out, e.g. the  Eighties or nineteenth century. Laboratory parameters, time, temperature,  length, area, mass, and volume should be expressed using digits. </p>
      <p><strong>Units:</strong></p>
      <p>The International Unit System must  be used, with the exception of blood pressure values which are to be reported  in mmHg. Please use the metric system for the  expression of length, area, mass, and volume. Temperatures are to be given in  degrees Celsius. </p>
      <p><strong>Devices and equipment: </strong></p>
      <p>The  Materials and Methods section must include sufficient technical information to  allow the experiments to be repeated. The sources of all media (i.e., name and  location of manufacturer) or components of a new formulation must be provided. <br>
        When  centrifugation conditions are mentioned, give enough information to enable  another investigator to repeat the procedure: brand of the centrifuge  (manufacturer), model of the equipment and modelo of the rotor, temperature,  time at maximum speed, and centrifugal force (X g rather than revolutions per  minute). <br>
        For devices and other products, the  specific brand or trade name, the manufacturer and their location (city, state,  country) should be provided the first time the device or product is mentioned  in the text, for example, &ldquo;IBM SPSS Statistics version 21.0 was used (IBM  Corp., Armonk, NY, USA)&quot;. Another example: QIAamp&reg; DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Hilden, USA). Thereafter, the generic term (if appropriate) should be  used.</p>
      <p><strong>Names and identification of drugs and  other products: </strong></p>
      <p>Authors are asked to use the  Recommended International Nonproprietary Name (rINN) for medicinal substances,  unless the specific trade name of a drug is actually relevant to the  discussion. Generic drug names should appear in lowercase letters in the text.  If a specific proprietary drug needs to be identified, the brand name may  appear only once in the manuscript in parentheses following the generic name  the first time the drug is mentioned in the text.</p>
      <p> The  description of new methods should be complete and give sources of unusual  chemicals, reagents, equipment, or microbial strains. When large numbers of  microbial strains or mutants are used in a study, authors are asked to include  tables identifying the immediate sources (i.e., sources from whom the strains  were obtained) and properties of the strains, mutants, bacteriophages, and  plasmids, etc.</p>
      <p><strong>Patient identi&#64257;cation:</strong></p>
      <p>The informed consent is not needed  if the patient cannot be identified from any material in a manuscript. In the  absence of the informed consent, identifying details, such as patient initials,  specific dates, specific geographic exposures, or other identifying  features(including body features in figures), should be omitted, but this must  not alter the scientific meaning.</p>
      <p> Important  information that is relevant to the scientific meaning should be stated so that  the patient cannot be identified, e.g., by stating a season instead of a date,  or a region instead of a city.</p>
      <p> If a patient can be identified from  the material in a manuscript, the informed consent is required. It can be obtained from the patient(s) or their  parents/legal guardians in the case of minors.</p>
      <p> For  children of seven years old or more, beyond the informed consent of the  parents/legal guardians, an informed assent of the child should be provided. <br>
        The  Informed consent requires that the patient has had the opportunity to see and  approve the manuscript prior to submission. The written informed consent must  state either that the patient has seen and approved the complete manuscript, or  that the patient declines to do so.</p>
      <p> The  patient consent should be attached as an additional file at the time of the manuscript  submission. A statement attesting the receipt and archiving of the written  consent of the patient should be included in the published article.</p>
      <p>  <strong>Randomized Controlled Trials and Clinical Trials:</strong></p>
    The&nbsp;<strong>Revista  do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de S&atilde;o Paulo</strong>&nbsp;supports the policy of  Clinical Trials registration delivered by WHO and the International Committee  of Medical Journals Editors (ICMJE) recognizing the importance, in open access,  of these initiatives for the registration and international knowledge of the  information on clinical studies. Therefore, from 2007 on, only papers of  clinical research dealing with these issues having an identification number  provided by one of the clinical assays validated by established criteria from  WHO and ICMJE will be accepted. The addresses can be found in the ICMJE site (<a href="http://www.icmje.org/" target="_blank">http://www.icmje.org</a>).&nbsp;<strong>The trial  registration number should be written at the end of the summary</strong>.</td>
