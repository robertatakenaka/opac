      <p>RAUSP  publishes original empirical and theoretical research in the field of management  in order to contribute to the development of the area. All empirical methods -  including quantitative, qualitative, field, and laboratory methods - are  accepted. To be published, the article should present both empirical and  theoretical relevant contributions. The articles will be accepted after an  analysis by the editors that make the first evaluation. In case of preliminary  approval, the articles are sent to the reviewers.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ARTICLES </strong><br>
        The articles may be submitted in English or Portuguese (provided the  authors submit a final version in English for publication), and must respect  various aspects regarding scope, purpose, format, and life cycle.</p>
      <p><strong>Scope</strong><br>
        The  articles may cover a wide range of topics and management practices in different  industrial sectors, geographic areas and functional specialties.</p>
      <p><strong>Objective</strong><br>
        RAUSP readers should be motivated to establish a discussion agenda  within their organizations about the concepts presented in the Journal. To this  end, the articles should provide unprecedented insights that help to enhance  the experience of managers and researchers, increase knowledge about how  organizations function, and improve understanding of how to deal with the growing  management challenges. Articles can fulfill this main objective in four  different ways: by offering new ideas and different approaches to management;  by describing best practices and management techniques used in different  organizations; by analyzing innovative solutions for practical management  cases; and by communicating recent cutting-edge research in the management field.</p>
      <p><strong>Format</strong><br>
        Articles for publication in RAUSP should be presented in a format that  enhances their concept, using the following predetermined structure:  presentation of the conceptual objective, development of the thought process,  and conclusions.&nbsp; <br>
  <strong>Lifecycle</strong><br>
        Articles should be of lasting interest. They should  not be perishable products, devoid of future value. Their ideas and concepts  should be sound enough to continue to be of interest for a long time.</p>
      <p><strong>EVALUATION</strong><br>
    The articles submitted for appreciation are  evaluated by an Ad Hoc Body of Evaluators, using the double-blind review system,  meaning that throughout the evaluation process, the Evaluators are unaware of  who the author(s) is(are) and vice-versa. </p>    </td>
