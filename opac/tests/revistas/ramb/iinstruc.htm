      <p><b>Manuscript submission </b></p>

      <p>All  articles and letters should be sent only via website: <a href="http://www.ramb.com.br" target="_blank">www.ramb.org.br</a>. Just the realization of a  register, followed by the manuscript submission, following the rules described  here. Only articles will be accepted that, among its authors, contains at least  a doctor<strong>.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
      <p>The journal accepts  manuscripts in Portuguese, Spanish or English, however, if accepted, the English version will be published. All submitted manuscripts must  contain the manuscript file (with abstract and keywords, excluding Authors  Identifiers), the title page (including Authors Identifiers, and article's  intended section), cover letter, and separate files for each table and figure. </p>
      <p> All material submitted for  publication in RAMB cannot be in the evaluation process, have already been  published, or be submitted later to publication in other journals. All  submissions are reviewed by the Editorial Board. In preparing the manuscript,  authors should indicate which areas are related to the editorial article in  order to be sent to a specific editorial review.</p>
      <p> The Editorial Board  strongly recommends that the authors do a search for articles related to the  theme and previously published in this journal or other journals indexed in  SciELO, using the same keywords of the proposed article. These items should be  considered by the authors in preparing the manuscript in order to stimulate the  scientific exchange between the SciELO journals.</p>
      <p><strong>What  happens after submission</strong></p>
      <p>        Due to the large number of manuscripts  received, the Editorial Board has adopted selection criteria for the peer  review process. On receipt, the manuscript is appraised by a RAMB editor for  its conformity to the guidelines and preferences of the journal. As occurred  with other journals, most submitted manuscripts do not pass this initial  screening and are not sent out for peer review. Manuscripts are initially  evaluated according to the following criteria: subjects fall within the scope  of the journal and are relevant to our readership, the main topic has general  medical interest, title and abstract are appropriate, writing is clear, study  methods are well defined and appropriate (including, in the case of clinical  trials, sample size, statistical analysis and Ethics Committee approval),  results are clearly presented, and conclusions are reasonable and supported by  the data. This procedure aims to reduce the time between date of submission and  editorial acceptance or rejection, without hindering the submission process.  Only manuscripts that have passed this initial screening by the editors will  undergo complete peer review. </p>
      <p> If a manuscript is deemed  unsuitable for publication by the editors, the authors will be notified of this  decision within 2 weeks (starting after the review for proper formatting).  Peer-review reports with the reviewers&rsquo; recommendations about acceptance or  rejection will be sent to the authors as soon as possible. Although there are  strict time limits on the peer-review process, most journals count on the  remarkable collaborative spirit of the scientific community, which, due to  their numerous duties, cannot always meet deadlines. Authors who are advised that  their manuscript must be revised are required to provide a document detailing  their response to each reviewer&rsquo;s comment upon resubmission. In addition,  revised manuscripts should clearly indicate changes made to the text using red  font, and the original text should be
        kept and marked as underlined text. </p>
      <p> Papers are published on a  first-come, first-served basis, but the Editorial Board reserves the right to  make case-by-case exceptions. After acceptance for publication, the authors  will receive page proofs for checking, but corrections should be limited to  typesetting errors. Proofs should be returned within two days. After final  approval by the authors, no changes can be made to the paper.</p>
      <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p><strong>EDITORIAL  BOARD</strong></p>
      <p>        The Editorial Board  consists of an Editor-in-Chief, Associate Editors, Assistant Editors, and an  Advisory Board in the following areas: Clinical Medicine, Clinical Surgery,  Public Health, Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Bioethics, Oncology,  Emergency and Intensive Care Medicine, Pharmaceutical Medicine, and  Evidence-based Medicine. The Editorial Board is responsible for the initial  appraisal and acceptance or rejection of manuscripts submitted for publication.  The editor in chief has the prerogatives that the position gives it to  accept or reject any article, regardless of peer review, as well as set the  edition of its publication. </p>
