      <p>Currently, submissions are accepted for manuscripts written in Portuguese and English. The authors&acute; full names as well as their institutional affiliation must be inserted in the appropriate fields on the submission page. This information must not appear in the manuscript. <i>Ci&ecirc;ncia Animal Brasileira</i> suggests that papers should be written by no more than six authors. Papers written by more than six authors will be considered exception and evaluated by the Editorial Board and, if necessary, correction will be requested. The denial of such request may lead to refusal of publication. The journal also suggests that papers should be presented within 20 pages, and figures, graphics and tables should be displayed in the body of the text, where they are mentioned. It is important to emphasize that research with animals should be approved by the Ethics Committee of the institution where the study was carried out. The absence of approval impedes the publishing of the paper.</p>
      <p>Manuscripts in Portuguese  should be organized as follows:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>Title in Portuguese:</b> Times New Roman font at 14 points, uppercase letters, in bold and centered;</p>
        <p><b>Abstract in Portuguese (Resumo)</b>: Times New Roman font at 11 points, space 1, justified alignment, with up to 200 characters;</p>
        <p><b>Keywords in Portuguese (palavras-chave)</b>: similar to abstract with up to five words not present in the title;</p>
        <p><b>Title in English </b>(mandatory): Times New Roman font at 12 points, uppercase letters, in bold and centered;</p>
        <p><b>Abstract in English</b> (not Summary): Times New Roman font at 11 points, space 1, justified alignment, with up to 200 characters;</p>
        <p><b>Keywords: </b>similar to keywords in Portuguese.</p>
</blockquote>
      <p>Papers should be divided  into sections in the following order:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>Introduction</b> (up to 3000 digits);<br>
        <b>Material and  Methods</b> (subheadings are not accepted);<br>
        <b>Results and Discussion</b>;<br>
        <b>Conclusions</b>;<br>
        <b>Acknowledgments</b> (optional);<br>
        <b>References</b> (not bibliography).</p>
</blockquote>
      <p>The text should be typed by using Times New Roman font at 12 points, space 1.5 and justified alignment, except for References, which should be set in Times New Roman font at 11 points, space 1, with six points above and below the paragraph, without indentation.</p>
    <p>References should be numbered in the order in which they appear in the text. The full list of references, at the end of the article, must follow Vancouver style (complete <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7256/" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7256/</a>; concise <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html" target="_blank">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html</a>).</p>
    <p>Manuscripts submitted in  English should present the same format and sections as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><b>Title in English</b>; <br>
        <b>Abstract in English</b>; <br>
        <b>Keywords</b>; <br>
        <b>Title in Portuguese</b> (mandatory); <br>
        <b>Abstract in Portuguse</b> (Resumo, mandatory); <br>
        <b>Keywords in Portuguese</b> (Palavras-chave, mandatory); <br>
        <b>Introduction</b>; <br>
        <b>Material and Methods</b>; <br>
        <b>Results and Discussion</b>; <br>
        <b>Conclusions</b>; <b>Acknowledges</b> (optional);<br>
        <b>References</b></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b>Short communications</b> and <b>case reports</b> are no longer accepted for submission. <b>Reviews</b> will only be published in cases of peer-refereed invitation by the Editorial Board.</p>
    <p>Using simple or extended abstracts as well as full papers published on annals as reference may be difficult for recovery; therefore, we request that this kind of material <b>must not</b> be used as reference.</p>
    <p>Likewise, theses and dissertations should also be avoided. If their use is necessary, we request that only documents from the <b>last three years</b> are cited. The webpage where it can be found must be indicated, especially because this kind of document can be found in university databases under .pdf format.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, we recommend the use of papers as reference instead of textbooks, besides prioritizing references up to five years of publishing.</p>
    <p>The Scientific Editor may request information regarding the references by the time of editing the paper. A prompt response may fasten the publication process. The easy recovery of information is the key point of bibliographic, technical and electronic references.</p>
