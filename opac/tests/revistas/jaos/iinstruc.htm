        </blockquote>
      <p><b>3 Revision Criteria</b></p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>3.1 Pre-evaluation: manuscripts in accordance with the instructions 
          will be appreciated by Associate Editors regarding its adequacy to Journal 
          scope and the presentation of all required documents. Papers considerated 
          inadequate will be rejected and returned to authors.</p> 
        <p>3.2 Technical review: manuscripts will be firstly evaluated regarding 
          presentation according to the instructions for authors and presence 
          of mandatory documents required for submission. Manuscripts not in accordance 
          with instructions will be returned to authors for adjustments before 
        being reviewed by Associate Editors and referees.</p>
        <p>3.3 Merit and content evaluation: papers approved by Associate Editors 
          will be evaluated in their scientific merit and methods by at least 
          two <em>ad hoc</em> referees from different institutions of that of the authors, 
          besides the Editor-in-Chief.</p>
          <blockquote> 
          <p>3.3.1 As part of the evaluation process, all manuscripts will be submitted to analysis by a plagiarism software.</p>
          <p>3.3.2 Editor-in-Chief will decide on manuscript 
          acceptance. When revision of the original is required, the manuscript 
          will be returned to the corresponding author for modification. A revised 
          version with modifications will be re-submitted by the authors, and 
          that will be re-evaluated by the Editor-in-Chief and Editorial Board, 
          if necessary.</p>
          </blockquote>
         <p>3.4 After approval of the scientific merit, manuscripts will pass through 
          a final review performed by a professional assigned by the JAOS. If manuscripts are still considered inadequate, 
          they will be returned to authors for revision.</p>
        <p>3.5 Authors and referees will be kept anonymous during the review process.</p>
        <p>3.6 Contents of the manuscript are the authors&#146; responsibility 
          and do not reflect the opinion of the Editor-in-Chief or Editorial Board.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><b>4 Galley Proofs</b></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>4.1 Galley proofs will be sent to the corresponding author by electronic 
          mail in pdf format for final approval.</p>
        <p>4.2 Approval of galley proofs by the corresponding author should be 
          returned with corrections, if necessary, within 48 hours.</p>
        <p>4.3 Corrections in the galley proofs should be restricted to minor mistakes 
          that do not modify the content of the manuscript. Major corrections 
          will imply that the manuscript should enter the review process again.</p>
        <p>4.4 If there is no return of proof in 48 hours, the Editor-in-Chief will consider the version without changes as the final version.</p>
          <p>4.5 Inclusion of new authors is not allowed at this phase of the publication

      <p><b>3 ETHICAL PRINCIPLES AND REGISTRATION OF CLINICAL TRIALS</b></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><b>3.1 Experimental procedures in humans and animals</b></p>
        <p>The Journal of Applied Oral Science reassures the principles incorporated 
          in the Helsinky Declaration and insists that all research involving 
          human beings, in the event of publication in this journal, be conducted 
          in conformity with such principles and others specified in the respective 
          ethics committees of authors&#146; institution. In the case of experiments 
          with animals, such ethical principles must also be followed. When surgical 
          procedures in animals were used, the authors should present, in the 
          Material and Methods section, evidence that the dose of a proper substance 
          was adequate to produce anesthesia during the entire surgical procedure. 
          All experiments conducted in human or animals must accompany a description, 
          in the Material and Methods section, that the study was approved by 
          the respective Ethics Committee of authors&#146; affiliation and provide 
          the number of the protocol approval.</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>3.1.1 Papers presenting <b>clinical trials</b> or <b>clinical studies 
            in human volunteers or in animals</b> must contain the Ethical Committee 
            approval of the reports <b>as mandatory supplementary file</b>.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>3.1.2 Papers describing studies in animals must be submitted with the ARRIVE Checklist as mandatory supplementary file. The ARRIVE Checklist is available at

        </blockquote>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>3.1.3 Ethics Committee certificate written in different languages from English, Spanish and Portuguese must be full translated into English.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><b>3.2 Clinical Trial Registration</b></p>
        <p>The Journal of Applied Oral Science supports the policies of the World 
          Health Organization (WHO) and the International Committee of Medical 
          Journal Editors (ICMJE) for the registration of clinical trials. The 
          journal recognizes the importance of such initiatives for the registration 
          and international publication of clinical studies with an open access. 
          Therefore, the Journal of Applied Oral Science will publish only those 
          clinical trials that have previously received an identification number validated by the criteria established by the WHO and ICMJE. 
          The WHO defines clinical trials as "any research study that prospectively 
          assigns human participants or groups of humans to one or more health-related 
          interventions to evaluate the effects on health outcomes. Interventions 
          include but are not restricted to drugs, cells and other biological 
          products, surgical procedures, radiologic procedures, devices, behavioral 
          treatments, process-of-care changes, preventive care, etc".</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>3.2.1 Manuscripts presenting clinical trials in human volunteers
