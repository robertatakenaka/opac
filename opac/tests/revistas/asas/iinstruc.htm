      <p>The journal publishes original articles in
  all areas of Animal Science and Zootechny, including genetics and genetic
  improvement, nutrition and digestion, physiology and endocrinology,
  reproduction and lactation, growth, etiology and animal well-being,
  environment and installations, food evaluation and animal production.</p>
      <p>The policy of the Editorial board comprises
        the publication of original articles that may significantly have an impact on
        Agronomy field of knowledge. Only original articles shall be published. Publication
        of articles depends on the approval of the Editorial Board, base on peer
        reviews.</p>
      <p>Articles will be reviewed by three peers
        acknowledged for their scientific production and research, from higher
        institutions in Brazil and abroad. After the necessary corrections and
        possible suggestions, the paper shall be accepted if two peers give a
        favorable statement; the article will be rejected if two peer reviews are
        unfavorable.</p>
      <p>Its aims are:</p>
      <p>&bull; To publish original articles in
        thematic areas relevant to Animal Production;</p>
      <p>&bull; To publish articles that
        significantly contribute towards the knowledge of Vegetal production,
        featuring a scientific stance and in-depth knowledge on themes and trends
        within Animal production;</p>
      <p>&bull; To reach its target public
        which mainly consists of undergraduate and postgraduate students and
        researchers working in universities, research centers and firms both in
        Brazil and abroad.</p>
      <p>&bull; To provide a strict evaluation
        policy with articles sent for publication; each manuscript is evaluated by
        three revisers who are carefully selected from the scientific community,
        especially doctoral supervisors and CNPq&rsquo;s productivity researchers;
        acceptance of article is the result of the revisers&rsquo; assessment and of the
        editors concerned;</p>
      <p>&bull; To respect the ethical
        principles of research which should be explicitly acknowledged in the
        Materials &amp; Methods section (and approved by the ethics committee in animal
        research) and taking into account the biosecurity norms inherent to this type
        of research; </p>
      <p>&bull; To maintain a high ethical
        behavior with regard to the review and its collaborators;</p>
      <p>&bull; To maintain strict quality in
        scientific article to be published;</p>
      <p>&bull; To select revisers featuring
        ethical stance and professional respect to authors, impartial in their
        decisions and imparting constructive and professional criticism;</p>
      <p>&bull; To select revisers
        scientifically acknowledged by colleagues in their area of knowledge, with
    special preference to CNPq&rsquo;s productivity scholars.</p>
      <p><strong>OPEN ACCESS POLICY</strong></p>
      <p>Acta Scientiarum. Animal Sciences is published under the Open Access model and is therefore free for anybody to read and download, and to copy and disseminate according to the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 policy.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>APCS (ARTICLE PROCESSING CHARGES) AND SUBMISSION CHARGES</strong></p>
      <p>Acta Scientiarum. Animal Sciences is free of any kind of submission/publication fees, thus the authors are not charged to publish with us.</p>
      <p><strong>POLICIES AGAINST PLAGIARISM AND BAD CONDUCT IN RESEARCH</strong></p>
      <p>In the wake of our tradition in excellence, we would like to inform collaborators on editorial improvements that foreground the integrity of articles published by the&nbsp;<em>Acta Scientiarum</em>. Following guidelines by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) stimulating the identification of the practice of plagiarism, bad practices, frauds, possible violations in Ethics and indicting, we would like to recommend the following:</p>
      <p><strong>1. Authors are invited to visit the COPE website</strong><a href="http://publicationethics.org/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=pt-BR&q=http://publicationethics.org/&source=gmail&ust=1472308135310000&usg=AFQjCNHMc8DdvyWekMaGL6Xq85kqCncDew">http://publicationethics.org</a>&nbsp;for information on authors and editors on Ethics in research;</p>
      <p><strong>2. Prior to submission of scientific articles, authors should follow the criteria below:</strong></p>
      <p>- articles that contain data acquisition or analysis and interpretation of data from other publications should refer to the latter explicitly and directly;</p>
      <p>- articles with a critical review on the intellectual contents of other authors should duly quote the latter authors;</p>
      <p>- all authors should attend to the authorship criteria of an unpublished article and no researcher involved in the investigation should be omitted from the list of authors;</p>
      <p>- the definite approval of the article is the role of the respective editors and of the editorial board.</p>
      <p><strong>3. So that the above criteria could be complied with, the following procedures will be taken:</strong></p>
      <p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Editors will evaluate manuscripts by&nbsp;<strong><em><a href="http://www.crossref.org/08downloads/handouts/crosscheck.pdf" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=pt-BR&q=http://www.crossref.org/08downloads/handouts/crosscheck.pdf&source=gmail&ust=1472308135310000&usg=AFQjCNGeueYMZxWU4GxS3aG0YMU7yw_UCA">CrossCheck</a></em></strong>&nbsp;system immediately after submission. Contents of the scientific articles will be evaluated to identify any sort of plagiarism, double submissions, already published articles and possible frauds in research;</p>
      <p>b)&nbsp; With these results in hand, the editors and the editorial board decide whether the manuscript is sent for the review of peers, who will also make their own evaluations;</p>
      <p>c) After acceptance and prior to publication, the article may again be assessed.</p></td>
