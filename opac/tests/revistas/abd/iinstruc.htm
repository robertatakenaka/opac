<p>Choose the section the article belongs to and  verify, on the cover sheet, the full title of the manuscript, the name(s) of  the author(s), full and abbreviated, academic degrees, the name of the  institution where the study was conducted, the institution which the author(s)  are affiliated to and their respective functions, the complete address of the  main author, his or her phone numbers and email address, financial support and  potential conflicts of interest. When required by the Editorial Staff for  inclusion in the Investigation and Review Sessions, the specific participation  of each author in the conduction of the study should be informed, through a  declaration signed by the main author (please see "Authorship  Criteria" below).</p>
   <p> Indicate at least 3 and at most 10  descriptors (keywords) which identify the subjects discussed in the text and  which are included in the publication "Descriptors in Health Sciences" (DeCS),  of Bireme, available on the website <a href="http://decs.bvs.br/">http://decs.bvs.br</a> or in <em>Medical Subject Headings</em> (MeSH), of <em>Index Medicus</em>, available on the website <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh">www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh</a>.</p>
   <p>     <strong><u>Authorship Criteria </u></strong> <br>
     To be classified as  author an individual must have given significant intellectual contribution to  the performance of the study. This involves participation in conceiving and  planning the study; in collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data; in writing  or critically reviewing the manuscript, and in approving its final version.  Other participation, such as securing financial support, data collecting and  cataloging, technical support for conducting medical protocols, patient  referral, interpretation of routine exams and service supervision or department  heading, which is not directly involved in the study, does not constitute  criteria for authorship. However, if these individuals have significantly  contributed to the study, they may be cited in the "Acknowledgements", at the  end of the text, by means of written authorization from the individuals in  charge of the study.</p>
   <p>  <strong><u>References</u></strong> <br>
     Unabridged bibliographical references, in  order of citation, should include only publications mentioned in the manuscript  and follow the norms of the "Uniformity Requirements for Manuscripts  Submitted to Biomedical Journals&quot; (Vancouver Style). Journal titles must be  abbreviated as in <em>Index Medicus</em>,  whose list of abbreviations may be obtained in the NLM publication  "List of Serials Indexed for Online Users", available on the website <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7256">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7256</a>.

   <p> To use photographs of patients, their  identity should be kept anonymous. Otherwise, it will be necessary to obtain  written permission for their disclosure and dissemination (please see  Protection of Rights and Privacy of Patients below).<strong><u></u></strong></p>
   <p><strong><u>Protection of Rights and Privacy of Patients  Participating in Research </u></strong> <br>
     Information that may reveal the identity of a  research participant or case report should not be published as descriptions,  photographs or genealogy, unless the information is essential for scientific  purposes. In this case, the patient or person responsible for the patient must  give written permission for its publication.</p>
   <p> The written consent for this purpose requires  that the manuscript to be published be shown to the patient or person  responsible for him/her. Acknowledgment that authorization has been granted  should be included in the publication.</p>
   <p> In the pursuit of anonymity, patient data  must never be altered or falsified. Details that may help identifying  individuals should be omitted if they are not essential. <br>
     Patient names, their initials or hospital  records should not be used, especially in the illustrative materials.</p>
   <p> When experiments with animals are conducted, the  approval of the Ethics Committee for Animal Research of the Institution where  the research was conducted  should be informed. </p>
   <p><strong><u>Reproduction of images </u></strong> <br>
