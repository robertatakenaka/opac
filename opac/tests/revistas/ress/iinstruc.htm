        If any software has been used for reference  management, such as Zotero, Endnote, Reference Manager or others, these  references must be converted into text. Authors have exclusive responsibility  for the accuracy of the references listed and for correct citations in the  text.
      
      <p><strong>Tables and figures</strong>
      <p>
        Original and review articles should contain up  to 5 tables and/or figures, in total. For research notes and experience  reports, the limit is 3 tables and/or figures;  and for experience reports, four tables and/or figures.
      <p>Figures and tables should  be put at the end of the manuscript, when possible, or in separate files sorted  as cited in the text, always in editable format. Tables and figures titles  should be concise and avoid the use of abbreviations or acronyms. If these must  be used in titles, they should be explained with subtitles at the bottom of  each table or figure. Tables  and figures must be presented in black and white or grey shades only.  <br>
Tablesand charts (classified  and titled in the same way as figures), should be presented in text The following formats will  be accepted: DOC (Microsoft Word), RTF (Rich Text Format) or ODT (Open Document  Text). Organization charts and flowcharts must be presented in text format or  vectorial format. The following types of files will be accepted: DOC (Microsoft  Word), RTF (Rich Text Format), ODT (Open Document Text), WMF (Windows  MetaFile), EPS (Encapsuled PostScript) or SVG (Scalable Vectorial Graphics).  Maps should be presented in vectorial format. The following types of files are  accepted: WMF (Windows MetaFile), EPS (Encapsuled PostScript) or SVG (Scalable  Vectorial Graphics). Maps originally produced in image format and later saved  in vectorial format will not be accepted. Graphs must be sent in vectorial  format. The following types of files are accepted: XLS (Microsoft Excel), ODS  (Open Document Spreadsheet), WMF (Windows MetaFile), EPS (Encapsuled  PostScript) or SVG (Scalable Vectorial Graphics).  Satellite images and photographs must be  presented in the following types: TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) or BMP  (Bitmap). The minimum resolution must be 300dpi, with minimum size of 17,5cm  width, and file size limit of 10Mb. 
      <p><strong>Use of acronyms</strong>       
      <p>      The use of uncommon acronyms should be avoided.  Their use should be employed only when they are recognized by the literature;  valuing the manuscript clarity. Some recognized acronyms  are: WHO, HIV, AIDS. 
      <p> Acronyms with up to three letters should be  written in upper case letters (e.g. DOU, USP, OIT). When unknown acronyms are  used for the first time the words they represent must be written in full,  followed by the acronym in brackets. Acronyms and abbreviations comprised only  of consonants should be written in upper case letters. Acronyms with four  letters or more should be written in capital letters, if each one of them is  pronounced separately (e.g. BNDES, INSS, IBGE). In the case of acronyms with  four letters or more that form a word comprised of vowels and consonants, only  the first letter should be capitalized (e.g. Funasa, Datasus, Sinan). Acronyms  including upper and lower case letters should be written as originally created  (e.g. CNPq, UnB). Foreign acronyms (not Brazilian ones) are recommended to be  translated into Portuguese if such translation is universally accepted. If  there is no corresponding acronym in Portuguese, the original acronym is to be  used even if the full name in Portuguese does not correspond to the acronym  (e.g. Organiza&ccedil;&atilde;o das Na&ccedil;&otilde;es Unidas para a Educa&ccedil;&atilde;o, a Ci&ecirc;ncia e a Cultura -  Unesco). Some foreign acronyms have been adopted in popular communication as a  name, such as the word AIDS in English. The Ministry of Health National AIDS  Commission (CNAIDS) has decided to recommend that all Ministry documents and  publications may refer to the acronym by its original English name, but in  lower case letters: aids (BRASIL. Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o Nacional de Sa&uacute;de. Manual de  editora&ccedil;&atilde;o e produ&ccedil;&atilde;o visual da Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o Nacional de Sa&uacute;de. Bras&iacute;lia: Funasa, 2004. 272p.).

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="15%"></td>
    <td width="70%"><p>Only manuscripts having the  indicated format and containing subjects relevant to the journal’s scope will  be accepted. In the case of studies involving human subjects, a preliminary  analysis will be made to verify their potential for being published and being  of interest to the journal’s readers. Manuscripts not meeting these  requirements will not be accepted. The Journal adopts Ephorus and iThenticate systems for identifying  plagiarism. 
    <p> Manuscripts considered relevant to be published  will go through the editorial process, composed by the following stages:      
      <p> 1) Technical review &ndash; it is conducted by the  Editorial Board. It consists basically on reviewing aspects of form and  scientific writing, so the manuscript fits into all the aspects from the  authors&rsquo; instructions and is able to start the external peer review process.      
      <p> 2) External peer review – it is conducted by at  least two reviewers who do not belong to the Editorial Board (ad hoc reviewers),  that present solid knowledge on the manuscript topic. On this stage, the ad hoc  reviewers are supposed to assess the scientific merit and the manuscript  format, making constructive critics to its improvement. RESS adopts the system  of double-blind review, in which the ad hoc reviewers do not know who the  authors are and are not named in the review sent to the authors. The ad hoc  reviewers must follow the ethics guidelines recommended by the COPE, available  at:<a href="http://publicationethics.org/files/Ethical_guidelines_for_peer_reviewers_0.pdf">http://publicationethics.org/files/Ethical_guidelines_for_peer_reviewers_0.pdf</a>
      <p> 3) Editorial Board review &ndash; after submitting  the redraft version of the manuscript, according to the double-blind review,  the editorial board will assess the manuscript again, checking the acceptance  or the reasons for not accepting the ad hoc reviewers&rsquo; suggestion, as well as,  when relevant, will highlight aspects that may be improved on the presentation  of the study report, issues related to the pattern for publishing at RESS. On  this stage, one more time, it is verified if the manuscript complies  with  all the  journal&rsquo;s instructions.      
      <p> 4) Editorial Committee final review &ndash; after the  manuscript is pre-approved for publishing by the editorial board, one of the  members of the Editorial Committee, with knowledge on the topic, will assess  it. On this stage, the manuscript can be considered as approved and ready for  publishing, approved with adjustment to be done or not approved for publishing.
      <p>It is important to highlight that, at all the  stages, more than one review round may be necessary.
      <p> The  considerations will be sent to the authors with a defined timetable to be  returned. The authors are recommended to pay attention to communications that  will be sent to the e-mail address informed on the submission, as well as to  observe the deadlines to answer. Not observing the deadline, mainly when there  is no justification , may be a reason to stop the  manuscript editorial process.
      <p> Once manuscripts have been approved for  publication but still require small adjustments or corrections, the journal&rsquo;s  editors reserve the right to do so.    
      
      <p><strong>Electronic page proof</strong> <br>
        After the manuscript acceptance, an electronic  page proof in PDF format will be sent by e-mail to the corresponding author.  Once the proof has been reviewed, the author must provide the journal&rsquo;s  Executive Secretary with authorization for publishing the manuscript within the  deadline specified by the Editorial Board.
      <p> Authors requiring any further information about  these instructions can contact the journal&rsquo;s secretariat by e-mail: <a href="mailto:ress.svs@gmail.com">ress.svs@gmail.com</a>  or <a href="mailto:revista.svs@saude.gov.br">revista.svs@saude.gov.br</a>.
