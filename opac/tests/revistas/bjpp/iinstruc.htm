 <td WIDTH="70%"><p>The Brazilian Journal of Plant Physiology (BJPP) (ISSN 1677-0420) is an international journal, published four times per year, which is devoted to publish original research contributions in several domains of plant physiology. BJPP publishes Research Articles, Short Communications, Reviews, Opinion, Articles and Letters to the Editor.</p>
  <p>BJPP does not publish articles in taxonomy, anatomy, systematics and ecology unless they have a physiological approach related to the following sections:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Biochemical Processes: primary and secondary metabolism, and biochemistry</li>
  <li>Photobiology and Photosynthesis Processes</li>
  <li>Cell Biology</li>
  <li>Genes and Development</li>
  <li>Plant Signalling and Response</li>
  <li>Plant Nutrition</li>
  <li>Growth and Differentiation: seed physiology, hormonal physiology and photomorphogenesis</li>
  <li>Post-Harvest Physiology</li>
  <li>Ecophysiology/Crop Physiology and Stress Physiology</li>
  <li>Plant-Microbe and Plant-Insect Interactions</li>
  <li>Instrumentation in Plant Physiology</li>
  <li>Education in Plant Physiology</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Contributions should present new and significant findings. Simple experiments on applications of existing methods or methodological and technical procedures will not be considered for publication as well as data from dose-response experiments without physiological discussion. Manuscripts assuring known aspects without coming up to a suitable understanding of the physiological mechanisms involved will be returned as a general rule without review.</p>
  <p>Misconduct on submitted manuscripts will compel us to reject them immediately. This includes double-submission, plagiarism, data manipulation and fraud. In the case of authors using material formerly published, official permission must be obtained prior to their reproduction. It&rsquo;s recommended to append an acknowledgement of the source in their manuscript.</p>
  <p>Acceptance will be retracted if misconduct is found after the manuscript is accepted, and a note to announce retraction will be requested to the authors. If, during the course of reviewing an article, an editor is alerted to possible problems such as fraudulent data in another publication, the Editorial Office may contact the journal in which the previous publication appeared to raise the concern. Submitted manuscripts will be examined using CrossCheck system - the intention is to detect plagiarism and verify data originality.</p></td>

 <td width="70%"><p>Submission of a manuscript to the Editor-in-Chief implies that it has not yet been published nor is it being considered for publication elsewhere. Submission of multi-authored manuscripts implies that the senior corresponding author has obtained the approval of all other co-authors to submit the manuscript to BJPP. BJPP assumes that all information contained in an article is full responsibility of the authors, including the accuracy of the data and the conclusions resulting from them. Authors are requested to send the manuscript (in a single manuscript file including text as well as tables, figure legends, and figures) by e-mail to the Editor-in-Chief. Files should be submitted preferentially as a Microsoft Word&reg; document.</p>
  <p>Photographs that are important or essential for the understanding of the results must have high quality.</p>
  <p>On submitting a manuscript, the Editor-in-Chief will check if it fits the scope of the journal and if it follows the journal guidelines. Submissions that do not conform to these guidelines will be returned immediately to the authors for correction.</p>
  <p>The manuscripts will be sent to an Associate Editor and will judged by its originality and scientific quality before sending out for review. On submission, the authors may indicate up to five potential reviewers (with their respective e-mails) with recognized competence in the research area of the manuscript. However, the Associate Editors reserve the right to not follow these suggestions. Based on the reviewers comments the Associate Editors will suggest rejection, revision or acceptance of the manuscript but the final decision will be appraised by the Editor-in-Chief.</p>
 <p>Manuscript in which revision was requested should be returned to the Editor within 15 days; otherwise it will be considered as new submission. The revised version should be sent by email and accompanied with a letter responding to the reviewer's and editor's comments. Disregarded comments must be justified. Using track changes and comments throughout the text are highly recommended.</p></td>

  <p>BJPP only accepts manuscripts written in English. It is strongly recommended the text be checked by a native English-speaker who is familiar with scientific writing and terminology. <br>
  All texts should be 1.5 spaced, using Times New Roman or Arial font.</p>
  <p>To format the manuscript, please check a recent issue of BJPP. The pages must be numbered consecutively, including figures and tables (see an example of this page at the end of these instructions). Manuscript length should generally be no longer than 18 printed pages. The lines of each page must be numbered to aid reviewers.</p>
  <p>Arrange the manuscript in the following order:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Page 1: Cover Letter, each manuscript should be accompanied by a cover letter outlining the basic findings of the paper and their significance.</p>
  <p>Page 2: Full title of the submitted manuscript, full name and address of the corresponding author (including telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail address), running title, the number of tables and figures, the number of pages and the total word count. If Supplementary Data are included please specify the number of figures, tables or videos.</p>
  <p>Page 3: Four short (not exceeding 75 characters) bullets high-lighting the main aspects of the manuscript, followed by the Abstract (250 words) and three to six key words (in alphabetical order) which do not appear in the title. If necessary, a list of abbreviations can be included.</p>
  <p>Page 4: Research Articles should be organized as:</p>
  <blockquote>
   <p>Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, Supplementary Data (if applicable), Acknowledgements, References, Tables, Figure Legends and Figures</p>
  </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
 <p>There should be no repetition of Results in Discussion. Scientific names should be in italics. The complete scientific name (genus, species, and authority, and cultivar where appropriate) must be cited for every organism at the first mention. The generic name may be abbreviated to the initial thereafter except where intervening references to other genera with the same initial could cause confusion. If vernacular names are employed, they must be accompanied by the correct scientific name on first use.</p>
 <p>Items of Specialized Equipment mentioned in 'Material and Methods' should be accompanied by details of the model, manufacturer, and city and country of origin. Enzymes should be given with the EC-number when first mentioned. Numbers up to nine should be written out unless they are measurements. All numbers above and including ten should be in numerals. Do not start sentence with an abbreviation or a numeral. Dates should be as 20 May 2013, and Clock Time as 1:00am or 1:00pm.</p>
 <p>Literature citations in the text should be cited in chronological order and then sorted by author and year (e.g., Styles 1978; Meier and Bowling 1995; Meier et al. 1997; Silva et al. 2004a,b). Do not italicize et al. Always insert space between numeral and unit (e.g., 1 mL), with the exceptions of %, &permil; and &ordm;C (e.g., 1%). Only refer to papers as 'in press' if they have been accepted for publication in a named journal, otherwise use the terms 'unpublished results'. Supply the DOI number for papers published ahead of print. Avoid citing unpublished data. Unpublished observations or personal communications should be mentioned in the text (e.g., T. Carter, personal communication; T. Carter and J. Spanning, unpublished results). Titles of periodicals should be written in full.</p>
 <blockquote>
  <p><b>Short Communications</b></p>
  <p>Short communications are not intended to publish preliminary results. They should be concise but also contain significant findings. Scientific communications should not have more than ten double-spaced typewritten pages, including tables and figures. They should be sent with the first page as for regular manuscripts, but they do not have main headings. References should follow the text.</p>
  <p><b>Reviews</b></p>
  <p>In Reviews, authors are free to suggest the article structure, but tables and figures should follow the guidelines for manuscript publication in BJPP. Reviews will be submitted to referees. They must be written concisely, with emphasis on the state of the art of the subject reviewed. They should not have more than twenty double-spaced typewritten pages.</p>
  <p><b>Opinion</b></p>
  <p>To express a particular point of view on a controversial topic relevant to any aspect of plant physiology are considered for BJPP. </p>
  <p><b>Letters to the Editor</b></p>
  <p>Letters to the Editor are usually invited. Nevertheless, uninvited Editorials and Letters to the Editor on topics of interest or controversy will be considered for publication. Authors should contact the Editor-in-Chief (Ricardo Bressan-Smith, <a href="mailto:bjpp.sbfv@gmail.com">bjpp.sbfv@gmail.com</a>) before submission.</p>
	</blockquote>
  <p><b>Tables and Figures</b></p>
 	  <p>Figures and tables should not repeat data and should be reduced to a minimum. Tables and figures should be numbered consecutively with arabic numbers and, in the text, calls for tables and figures should appear as: "These data are shown in Table 1 and Figure1A...". Table and figure headings should be 1.5 space. Please use Table Formatting (i.e. use table cells); do not use tabs, spaces or hard returns when setting up columns. Footnotes to tables should be in font size 10 and indicated by lowercase superscript letters, beginning with a in each table. Each table and figure must be typewritten on a separate page of the manuscript, and should never be included in the text.</p>
 	  <p>Figure legends should be collated and typed with 1.5 space on a separate page preceding figures. Text and numbers in figure ordinates should be typed using font size no smaller than 10. Electronic photographic work should be submitted at the intended print size (8.4 cm for single column width or 17 cm for double column width). The publishers reserve the right to reduce figure sizes.</p>
  <p><b>Units, symbols and abbreviations:</b></p>
    <p>Scientific International units should be used throughout. For a comprehensive and detailed description of the units, symbols and terminology in plant science, consult Units, Symbols and Terminology for Plant Physiology, edited by F.B. Salisbury, Oxford University Press, Oxford. Briefly, use pascal (Pa) for pressure (e.g. -1 MPa), L for liter (e.g. 2.2 L), &mu;mol m-2 s-1 for photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), becquerel (Bq) for radioactivity, g for acceleration due to gravity (e.g. 2,000 g), s for second, min for minute, h for hour (ex: 1 s, 3 min, 2 h), Da for indication of molecular mass, which is represented by m (relative molecular mass of proteins is the same as molecular weight, Mr, and should not be accompanied by Da; e.g., the relative molecular mass Mr = 10,000), &Psi;w for water potential (&Psi;p for pressure potential, &Psi;s for solute potential and &Psi;m for matrix potential). For fluorescence variables, use F0, FV, FM, FV/FM and ETR. Please consult the last issue of each volume of BJPP for a broader range of units and symbols. Abbreviations are discouraged except for units of measurement, standard chemical symbols (e.g., Fe, Na), names of chemicals (e.g., ATP, MES, HEPES, H2SO4, NaCl, CO2), procedures (e.g., RT-PCR, qPCR, PAGE, RFLP), molecular terminology (e.g., bp, SDS) or statistical terms (e.g. ANOVA, SD, SE, n, F, t-test and r2) which are of general use. Other abbreviations should be spelled out at first mention and all terms must be written out in full when used to start a sentence. Abbreviations of scientific terms should not be followed by a full stop. Use the minus index to indicate 'per' (e.g., m-3, L-1, h-1) except in such cases as 'per plant' or 'per pot'. If you decide that a list of abbreviations would help the reader, this should be included following Page 3 (see above).</p>
  <p><b>Illustrations</b></p>
    <p>Coloured or black and white photographs must have high quality and can be included at the end of the text. Micrographs must contain a scale in the right corner. The number of photographs should be reduced to a minimum. Line drawings should be of uniform thickness. Text and numbers should be of proper dimensions.</p>
