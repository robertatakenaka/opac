    <p>The aim of <strong><em>Scientiae Studia</em></strong>is to give  visibility to academic production in the areas of philosophy and history of  science without neglecting the contributions of related areas, such as the  sociology of science and technology, the history of technical practices and the  philosophy of technology. The journal&rsquo;s orientation is strictly focused on  philosophical and historical studies of science, understood broadly to include  the exact, natural and human sciences, and the impact of the technological  application of science on culture and on society.&nbsp; From the outset, <strong><em>Scientiae Studia</em></strong> has  aimed to publish contributions that attempt to understand science as a  reflection of culture and an expression of the current stage of the process of  civilization, analyzing the internal aspects that mark the rationality and  autonomy of science, while also attending to the social values that give  sustenance to scientific and technological practices and that provide the  context for posing questions about the ethical and social responsibility of  scientists and technologists.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, the journal is addressed to the Portuguese and Spanish  speaking scientific and academic communities, aiming not only to share critical  (historical, epistemological, ethical) studies about science and technology,  but also to foster a greater linguistic and cultural integration among the  Latin American countries.</p>

    <p>It should be especially noted that the editorial policy of the journal  reflects a thoroughly interdisciplinary outlook, since it is dedicated to  studies that enter into contact with the frontiers of disciplines such as  philosophy, history, sociology and anthropology.</p>

    <p>The journal publishes academic articles, translations of historically  valuable scientific documents (mainly scientific correspondence), critical  analyses of current publications in the areas of interest, discussions of  relevant aspects of science and technology policies, and critical reviews of  classical and recent texts.</p>

Regarding peer review, an  Editorial Board has been established, composed of scholars whose competence is  recognized nationally and internationally in the areas of the journal&rsquo;s  specialization, and from the outset there has been a system of blind refereeing  in place that involves two referees for each article, so as to ensure the  quality of published articles, as well their fit with the journal&rsquo;s  orientation. Referees receive a set of instructions in order to ensure that the  form of referees&rsquo; reports is more or less uniform. </td>
