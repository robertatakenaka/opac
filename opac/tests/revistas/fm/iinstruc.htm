      <p><strong>Physical Therapy in Movement</strong>&nbsp;is a peer-reviewed journal that<em>&nbsp;</em>publishes scientific papers  in the areas of physical therapy and human health. The editorial assistant  coordinates the exchange of information between the authors and the reviewers,  and it is up to the editor in chief which articles will be accepted for  publication, based on the recommendations made by the reviewers. If an article  is rejected authors will receive  a notification along with the editor in chief’s&nbsp;explanation. Papers are accepted for  publication on the understanding that they have not been and will not be  published elsewhere, nor have they been submitted for simultaneous evaluation to  any other journal. The journal  adopts the Blackboard system for identifying plagiarism.</p>

Clinical  trial articles will only be accepted when registered in a Clinical Trial  Registry recommended by WHO and the ICMJE, and papers containing results from studies  with humans and/or animals will only be accepted for publication if clear that  all the&nbsp;ethical principles&nbsp;have  been followed in the investigation. These papers must necessarily include a  statement indicating that the research protocol has been approved by an  institutional ethics committee (as established in the National Health Council  Resolution 466/12 on the ethical guidelines for the development of research  involving human subjects). For experiments involving animals, follow&nbsp;<em>Pain</em>&nbsp;international  guidelines<em>.</em>&nbsp;(PAIN, 16: 109-110, 1983).</p>
