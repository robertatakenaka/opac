      <p>1- <b>Anais do Museu Paulista</b> is a journal published by Museu Paulista/USP. 

        Articles are received continuously, but it is up to the editors in charge 

        and to the Publishing Committee to decide on the opportune moment for 

        their publication and in which section they should be inserted. </p>

      <p>2- The publication of articles depends on their compliance with the Editorial 

        Standards and on the opinions issued by the Editorial Board, Publishing 

        Committee and/or ad hoc consultants. All the opinions are impartial and 

        confidential. </p>

      <p>3- Responsibility for the concepts expressed in the published articles 

        rests solely with their respective authors. </p>

      <p>4- <b>Anais do Museu Paulista</b> seeks to articulate investigative, 

        technological, educational and documentation activities. Thus, its sections 

        have been designed to bring together these different approaches as a means 

        to encourage interchange and integration. The journal consists of six 

        sections, namely: Debates, Material Culture Studies, Museums, Documents, 

        Conservation and Restoration (opened in 2003), and Bibliography. Debates 

        introduces works concerned with concepts and methodology, as well as initiatives 

        to take stock of the pros and cons on themes capable of generating controversy. 

        The main text is accompanied by commentary and a reply from a guest author. 

        Material Culture Studies, as the title indicates, is the journal's backbone 

        and the only permanent section. It presents the research being done in 

        the specific field of knowledge adopted by the periodical, plus everything 

        else that may enrich and provide a solid foundation for the studies in 

        question, such as theoretical and methodological approaches, techniques, 

        papers about other topics of interest for the purpose of comparison, alongside 

        contributions from Anthropology, Historical/Industrial Archeology, Sociology, 

        History of Art, Literature, Linguistics, Semiotics, Psychology, Economics, 

        Technology, Architecture, Geography, and so on. Museums offers articles 

        linking the study of material culture to specific museum contexts, such 

        as issues related to exhibitions, target audience research, documentation 

        systems, institutional collections, etc. Conservation and Restoration, 

        a section that was opened in 2003, brings together works concerning the 

        development of research and innovative techniques for the recovery of 

        documental sources, particularly objects, buildings, landscapes, and iconography. 

        Documents organizes and offers the reader material and visual sources, 

        preferably items that have never been published before or which have been 

        recently submitted to treatment or acquired. Finally, Bibliography plays 

        an instrumental role. In addition to providing new references and critical 

        reviews, it places a great emphasis on bibliography updates, and themed, 

        selected or annotated bibliographic compilations.</p>

      <p>5- Only articles submitted in accordance with the standards and rules 

        below will be accepted.</p>
