      <p><b>The reviewing process</b> </p>

      <p>The  Editorial Board carries out a preliminary evaluation of the manuscripts,  looking at adherence to the journal scope and publication guidelines,<strong> </strong>scientific  relevance, and command of language in the text. The Editorial Board decision  (eligible, not eligible) is  uploaded in the submission system. If modifications are needed, the  authors may submit a new version. If the manuscript is adequate for reviewing,  authors are requested to pay either the Simple or the Full Processing Fee.  Following, the manuscript is evaluated by at least two peer reviewers of that  specific theme and then by the Scientific Editor. The Scientific Editor can either (1)  recommend for publication, (2) ask for modifications, or (3) do not recommend  for publication. In situations 1 and 3, the manuscript is reviewed by the  Associate Editor, who holds the responsibility for the final decision. In  situation 2, the manuscript is returned to the author(s), who produce and  upload a new version in the submission system. The Scientific Editor checks the  new version and recommend it or not for publication. In both cases, the new  version is evaluated by the Associate Editor, for the final decision.</p>

      <p>No  modifications are incorporated to the manuscript without author’s approval .  Once the paper is accepted, an electronic copy of the formatted version is sent to the  correspondent  author who should make any necessary corrections and send it back within 48  hours. Extensive text corrections, whose format and content have already been  approved for publication, will not be accepted. Alterations, additions,  deletions and editing imply in  a new examination of the manuscript by the Editorial Board. Authors are held  responsible for any errors and omissions present in the text that has been returned  to the Editorial Board.</p>

      <p><b>Authorship</b></p>

      <p>To define the manuscript authors, consider the following criteria, based 

        on <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/about/editorialpolicies#authorship" target="_blank">http://www.biomedcentral.com/about/editorialpolicies#authorship</a>:</p>

      <p>Authors  are those who participated intensively in the work and therefore can take  public responsibility for the manuscript contents.</p>

      <p>Authors  are those who have made <strong>substantial contributions</strong> to the work  conception, design of experiments or gathering, analysis and interpretation of data.</p>

      <p>Authors  are also those who were strongly involved in  writing the manuscript or changed it decisively during the reviewing  process.</p>

      <p>The  simple collection of data; transference of genotypes, seeds or other inputs;  discussion about the experiments and/or results; as well as the general supervision or funding of  the research group, alone,  does not justify authorship and should be included in the <strong>Acknowledgements</strong></p>

      <p><b>The publishing idiom</b></p>

      <p>In  any point of the reviewing process, authors can indicate their will on  publishing the paper in English, Portuguese, or Spanish independent of the idiom originally used to write it.  For example, a  paper may be submitted and reviewed in Portuguese and published in English. In  this case, authors can either produce a translated version or authorize the  Editorial Board to forward the  manuscript to translating. If the translated version provided by authors  is below the idiomatic standard required for publication, the Editorial Board  will redirect the text for specialized reviewing. All costs related to  translating and idiomatic reviewing are charged to authors.</p>

      <p><b>Page charge</b></p>

      <p>Horticultura Brasileira charges US$ 30.00 or E$ 25.00 per page, plus 

        US$ 20.00 or E$ 20.00 for covering the fees of international money transference.</p>

      <p><b>Color Printing</b></p>

      <p>Horticultura Brasileira charges US$ 260.00 or E$ 220.00 per page printed 

        in colors, plus US$ 20.00 or E$ 20.00 for covering the fees of international 

        money transference.</p>
