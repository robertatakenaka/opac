      <strong>SCOPE</strong>
      <p>The <strong>Revista  Brasileira de Pol&iacute;tica Internacional (RBPI) </strong>receives contributions in an  ongoing flow in the form of scientific articles written in English. It issues  unpublished scientific articles whose theme is placed in the great area of  International Relations, comprising International and Comparative Politics,  Foreign Policy Analysis, International Law, History of International Relations  and Foreign Policy, and International Political Economy.</p>
      <p>        <strong>RBPI</strong> aims to  publish better and more innovative originals in the field of International  Relations. Contributions which do not emphasize international or  cross-border phenomena, defined as pertaining to the international studies  agenda, are out of the publication's scope.</p>
      <p>        <strong>RBPI</strong> maintains a high-quality standard and the first and more important criterion  for assessing contributions is the scientific quality. Before submitting any  piece of work, please certify your manuscript strictly follows the  below-presented journal standards.</p>
      <p> Successful manuscripts usually are characterized as  follows: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>They are introduced with a clear, concise argument that presents the  work's scientific contribution to the field of International Relations; </li>
        <li>They have an interpretation based on state-of-the-art literature which  indicates the manuscript's relevance to it; </li>
        <li>They present an indication of the importance of cited sources; </li>
        <li>They have arguments structured clearly in the body of the article,  presenting evidence unambiguously; </li>
        <li>They have a concluding section summarizing the content and analyzing  results, which may possibly introduce an agenda for further research; </li>
        <li>They observe the correct use of grammar and academic language in  English, and format consistent with the journal's criteria. </li>
        <li>They respect the criteria  of maximum extension. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Manuscripts that fail to be  admitted usually are characterized as follows: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>They are irrelevant to  the working field of the journal and present low adherence to the editorial  policy; </li>
        <li>They present imprecise, superficial, or incorrect treatment of the  theme; </li>
        <li>They lack adequate sources for sustaining arguments; </li>
        <li>Their presentation is flawed (non-adherence to the journal's standard  and writing and style problems); </li>
        <li>The writing is poor, the language is imprecise, and  they present logical or conceptual inaccuracies; </li>
        <li>They are  contributions that have been previously published elsewhere, in whole or in  part. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Before submitting, examine your  manuscript looking for potential expressions, sentences, and paragraphs which  may be omitted and, by doing so, not compromise the central argument, or even  help it become clearer. We also encourage potential collaborator so seek help  and detailed comments from qualified reviewers before submitting to the  Journal.</p>
      <p> Articles must present clear, concise writing in  English. Writing in either North American or British English is admitted, but  not a mix of both registers. In case you have no conditions of proper writing  in English, it is strongly recommended that the text is submitted only after  revision by a professional text reviser or translator who has experience in the  area of international studies. The  Secretariat may recommend certified translators and revisers, with whom the  Journal has worked throughout the last few years, who may provide translation  into English and English text revision services (those shall be paid directly  by the author to the service provider).</p>
      <p> Editors reserve the right to return articles that are  not pursuant to these instructions, which must be read carefully and followed  thoroughly. </p>
      <p><b>EDITORIAL POLICY </b></p>
      <p>The articles cannot have been previously published, in  whole or in part, in any other journal (even if in modified format), neither be  under consideration for publication in other media. This rule applies for both  abridged or unabridged versions and to excerpts of the article. RBPI is a  medium vehemently committed to good practices in scientific publication,  including in what concerns the full originality of published works and also the  due reference of arguments, data, and excerpts of texts of other authors or the  article's own authors.</p>
      <p> The editorial analysis process may  extend up to 120 days. The editorial analysis of all submitted contributions  takes place in three stages: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>All contributions are analyzed by <strong>RBPI</strong> Editorial Board, which will preliminarily decide on the adherence of the work  to the editorial policy of the journal, and verify its scientific consistency  and preliminary correction in writing acceptable conditions; </li>
        <li>The works approved in the first stage will be submitted to similarity-detection  mechanisms. This  necessarily involves the identification of excerpts of the manuscript that have  already been previously published, even if modified, by the contributor or  whomever else; </li>
        <li>The contributions approved in the  second stage will be submitted to scientific arbitration, in a double-blind  process. The arbitration may recommend full acceptance, acceptance with  modifications, or manuscript refusal. In case of refusal, the manuscript may  not be submitted again to RBPI even with modifications.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>When necessary, acknowledgements must refer  exclusively to the substantial support received by the author in the  development of the research that originated the article. Acknowledgements must  be inserted in the Title Page, as described previously. In case the work is  approved for publication, this part will be inserted in the end of the text, in  an Acknowledgments section.

      <p>The authors are responsible for the accuracy of  bibliographic references cited in their work. <br>
        The references may be cited in the text, as, for  example, (Almeida 2004), (Almeida and Farias 2009), (Almeida, Farias, and Cunha  2009) or, for three or more authors, (Almeida et al. 2010). Two or more  articles by the same authorship in the same year should be differentiated by  letters, as in (Almeida 2004a), (Almeida 2004b), (Almeida and Farias 2009a),  (Almeida and Farias 2009b), and so forth.</p>
      <p> The references must be listed at the end of the text,  in the <strong>Bibliographic references</strong> section, in alphabetical order of the cited work's first author's last name. If  there are more than three authors, use the first author's last name followed by  et al. The following examples are considered as a general guide for listing  references. </p>
