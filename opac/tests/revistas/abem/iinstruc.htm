    <p>We emphasize the importance of following these instructions carefully.  Failure to do so will delay the processing of your manuscript.</p>
    <p>
      Manuscripts should be submitted solely to ABE&amp;M and may not have  been published, or be under consideration for publication, in any substantial  form in another periodical—professional or lay.</p>
    <p>
      Manuscripts must be written in idiomatic English or Portuguese and  conform to the specifications described below. If authors are not fluent in  written medical and scientific English, they are strongly encouraged to have  their manuscripts reviewed and edited by an expert English writer prior to  submission. This will increase the chances that the paper will be accepted and  will speed the publication of those manuscripts that are accepted. </p>
    <p>
      <b>Papers that do not meet these  requirements will be returned to the author for necessary revision before  formal review. </b></p>
All submissions are initially evaluated in depth  by the scientific editors. Papers that do not conform to the general criteria  for publication will be returned to the authors without detailed review,  typically within three to five days. Otherwise, manuscripts will be sent to  reviewers (most commonly two).</td>

    <p>Reports of original research may be submitted to <b>ABE&amp;M</b> as an Original Article or Brief Report. Other special  categories of manuscripts are described below. All manuscripts must adhere to  the word count limitations, as specified below, for text only; the word count  does not include the abstract, references, or figure/table legends. The word  count must be noted on the title page, along with the number of figures and  tables. The format is similar for all manuscript categories and it is described  in detail in &ldquo;Manuscript Preparation&rdquo; section.</p>
    <p><b>Original  Articles</b><br>
      Original Article is a scientific report of the results of original  research that has not been published or submitted for publication elsewhere  (either in print or electronically). Represent a substantial body of laboratory  or clinical work. In general, original paper should not exceed 3600 words in  the main text, include no more than six figures and tables and 35 references. </p>
    <p><b>Review  Articles</b><br>
      The ABE&amp;M publishes review articles which present a balanced  perspective on timely issues within the field of clinical endocrinology. <b>All reviews are submitted upon invitation  and are subject to peer review. </b>Articles in this category are requested by  the Editors to authors with proven experience in the field. Authors considering  the submission of uninvited reviews should contact the editors in advance to  determine whether the topic that they propose is of current potential interest  to the Journal. <br>
      These manuscripts should be no longer than 4000 words in the main text,  include no more than four figures and tables and 60 references. The author  should mention the source and/or request authorization for use of previously  published figures or tables.<br>
  <b>Consensus  Statements</b><br>
      Consensus Statements related to the endocrine and metabolic health  standards and healthcare practices may be <b>submitted  by professional societies, task forces, and other consortia.</b> All such  submissions will be subjected to peer review, must be modifiable in response to  criticisms, and will be published only if they meet the Journal's usual  editorial standards. These manuscripts should typically be no longer than 3600  words in the main text, include no more than six figures and tables and 60  references. </p>
    <p><b>Brief  Report</b><br>
      Brief report should consist of new data of sufficient importance to  warrant immediate publication. It is a succinct description of focused study  with important, but very straightforward, negative or confirmatory results.  Brevity and clarity are always likely to enhance the chance of a manuscript  being accepted for publication. A maximum of 1500 words in the main text plus  up to 20 references and normally no more than two illustrations (tables or  figures or one of each).</p>
    <p><b>Case  report</b><br>
      A brief communication presenting collected case reports, or single case  reports of clinical or scientific significance. These reports should be concise  and focused. They should address observations of patients or families <b>that add substantially to the knowledge of  the etiology, pathogenesis and delineation of the natural history or management  of the condition described</b>. Brevity and clarity are always likely to  enhance the chance of a manuscript being accepted for publication. These  manuscripts should be 2000 words or less, with no more than four figures and  tables and 30 references.</p>
    <p><b>Letter</b><br>

Letters to the Editor may be submitted in  response to work that has been published in the Journal. Letters should be  short commentaries related to specific points of agreement or disagreement with  the published work. Letters are not intended for presentation of original data  unrelated to a published article. Letters should be no longer than 500 words  with no more than five complete references, and may not include any figures or  tables.</p></td>

    <p>
      <b>Materials and Methods</b><br>
      These should be described  and referenced in sufficient detail for other investigators to repeat the work.  The source of hormones, unusual chemicals and reagents, and special pieces of  apparatus should be stated. For modified methods, only the modifications need  be described. </p>
    <p><b>Results and Discussion</b><br>
      The Results section should  briefly present the experimental data in text, tables, and/or figures. For  details on preparation of tables and figures, see below. The Discussion should  focus on the interpretation and significance of the findings with concise  objective comments that describe their relation to other work in that area. The  Discussion should not reiterate the Results. </p>
    <p><b>Authorship</b><br>
      The ABE&amp;M ascribes to the authorship and contributorship guidelines  defined by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (<a href="http://www.ICMJE.org">www.ICMJE.org</a>). Unrestricted joint authorship is allowed. A  maximum of two corresponding authors is allowed.</p>
    <p>The uniform requirements for manuscripts  submitted to medical journals state that authorship credit should be based only  on substantial contribution to:</p>
    <ul>
      <p>1. conception and design, or analysis and  interpretation of data<br>
        2.	drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content<br>
        3.	and final approval of the version to be published.</p></ul>
      <p>All these conditions must  all be met. The corresponding author is responsible for ensuring that all  appropriate contributors are listed as authors and that all authors have agreed  to the manuscript’s content and its submission to ABE&amp;M.</p>
      <p><b>Conflict of interest</b><br>
        A conflict-of-interest statement for all authors must be included in the  main document, following the text, in the Acknowledgments section. If authors  have no relevant conflict of interest to disclose, it should be indicated in  the Acknowledgments section.</p>
      <p><b>Acknowledgments</b><br>
        The Acknowledgments section  should include the names of those people who contributed to a study but did not  meet the requirements for authorship. The corresponding author is responsible  for informing each person listed in the acknowledgment section that they have  been included and providing them with a description of their contribution so  they know the activity for which they are considered responsible. Each person  listed in the acknowledgments must give permission - in writing, if possible -  for the use of his or her name. It is the responsibility of the corresponding  author to collect this information. </p>

      <p><b>References</b><br>
        References to the  literature should be cited in numerical order (in parentheses) in the text and  listed in the same numerical order at the end of the manuscript on a separate  page or pages. The author is responsible for the accuracy of references. The number  of references cited should be limited, as indicated above for each category of  submission. </p>
      <p><b>Tables</b><br>
        Tables should be submitted  in the same format as your article (Word) and not another format. Please note:  we cannot accept tables as Excel files within the manuscript. Tables should be  self-explanatory and the data they contain must not be duplicated in the text  or figures. Tables must be constructed as simply as possible and be  intelligible without reference to the text. Each table must have a concise heading.  A description of experimental conditions may appear together with footnotes at  the foot of the table. Tables must not simply duplicate the text or figures. </p>
      <p><b>Figures and Legends</b><br>
        All figures must display  the figure number. Sizing the figure: The author is responsible for providing  digital art that has been properly sized, cropped, and has adequate space  between images. All color figures will be reproduced in full color in the  online edition of the journal at no cost to the authors. Authors are requested  to pay the cost of reproducing color figures in print (upon acceptance of the  manuscript, the publisher will provide price quotes).</p>
      <p><b>Photographs. </b> <br>
        TheABE&amp;M  strongly prefers to  publish unmasked patient photos. We encourage all prospective authors to work  with families prior to submission to address the issue of permission for review  and possible publication of patient images. If your submission contains ANY  identifiable patient images or other protected health information, you MUST  provide documented permission from the patient (or the patient’s parent,  guardian, or legal representative) before the specific material will be  circulated among editors, reviewers and staff for the purpose of possible  publication in ABE&amp;M. If it is necessary to identify an individual, use a  numerical designation (e.g. Patient 1) rather than using any other identifying  notations such as initials. </p>
      <p><b>Units of Measure</b><br>
        Results should be expressed  in metric units. Temperature should be expressed in degrees Celsius and time of  day using the 24-hour clock (e.g., 0800 h, 1500 h). </p>
      <p><b>Standard Abbreviations</b><br>
        All abbreviations in the text must be defined immediately after the  first use of the abbreviation.</p>

      <p><b>Experimental Subjects</b><br>
        To be considered, all  clinical investigations described in submitted manuscripts must have been  conducted in accordance with the guidelines in The Declaration of Helsinki and  must have been formally approved by the appropriate institutional review  committees or its equivalent. <br>
        The study populations  should be described in detail.<br>
        Subjects must be identified  only by number or letter, not by initials or names. Photographs of patients'  faces should be included only if scientifically relevant. Authors must obtain  written consent from the patient for use of such photographs. For further  details, see the Ethical Guidelines. <br>
        Investigators must disclose  potential conflict of interest to study participants and should indicate in the  manuscript that they have done so. </p>
      <p><b>Experimental Animals</b><br>
        A statement confirming that  all animal experimentation described in the submitted manuscript was conducted  in accord with accepted standards of humane animal care, as outlined in the  Ethical Guidelines, should be included in the manuscript. </p>
      <p><b>Molecular Genetic Description</b><br>
        • Use standard terminology  for variants, providing rs numbers for all variants reported. These can be  easily derived for novel variants uncovered by the study. Where rs numbers are  provided, the details of the assay (primer sequences, PCR conditions, etc.)  should be described very concisely. <br>
        • Pedigrees should be drawn  according to published standards (See Bennett <i>et al.</i> J Genet Counsel (2008) 17:424–433 - DOI  10.1007/s10897-008-9169-9). </p>
      <p><b>Nomenclatures</b><br>
        <b>- </b>For genes, use genetic  notation and symbols approved by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) – (<a href="http://www.genenames.org/">http://www.genenames.org/</a>). <br>
        - For mutation nomeclature  please use the nomenclature guidelines suggested by the Human Genome Variation  Society (<a href="http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/" target="_blank">http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/</a>) <br>
        - Provide information and a  discussion of departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The calculation  of HWE may help uncover genotyping errors and impact on downstream analytical  methods that assume HWE. <br>
        - Provide raw genotype  frequencies in addition to allele frequencies. It is also desirable to provide  haplotype frequencies. <br>
        - Whenever possible, drugs  should be given their approved generic name. Where a proprietary (brand) name  is used, it should begin with a capital letter. <br>
- Acronyms should be used sparingly and fully  explained when first used. </p></td>
