      <p><b>Editorial  <strong>policy</strong></b></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Mission:</strong>&nbsp;The  mission of BAR - Brazilian Administration Review is to contribute to  deeper understanding of theories of Administration  and its managerial implications by means of global dissemination of relevant papers in theory development and application produced by the Brazilian academia and the international scholarly  community.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Scope and focus:&nbsp;</strong>BAR publishes  conceptual, empirical and  methodology-focused articles in the broad field of Administration. Innovative  theoretical and methodological perspectives are welcome as long as they are  academically sound. Papers with greater potential for having an international  impact will be given preference. To be published in BAR, articles must bring  relevant theoretical, empirical or methodological contributions.</p>
<p>BAR’s editorial scope does not include teaching cases  or purely applied,  practitioner-oriented material.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Target audience:</strong>&nbsp;The target  audience of BAR is the Brazilian and the international scholarly communities in the field of Administration.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong>&nbsp;Submitted articles must be unpublished and should not be under  consideration for publication in any other journal. Previous publication of papers in conference  proceedings would not violate the originality requirements, but we recommend that articles  are significantly improved after conference presentation. Articles must  be written in English.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><strong>Article review</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<blockquote> 

        <p align="justify"><b>1. </b>Article review consists of two stages.&nbsp;In the first stage, the  editor-in-chief and an associate editor (chosen by the editor-in-chief based on the article’s main topic and methods) verify the  relevance of the submitted article, its alignment with the journal’s editorial scope, and  other aspects including originality and contribution to the area of  submission.&nbsp;Only articles the editors consider relevant to the academic  community and, in  particular, to the journal’s audience, proceed to further stages. Articles that pass the first stage of  analysis are sent to double blind, peer review by at least two reviewers assigned by the associate editor.</p>

        <p align="justify"><b>2.</b> Neither ANPAD nor its editors are responsible for the opinions, ideas and concepts included in published materials beyond concurring with  the potential academic impact on the literature. The authors bear full authority and responsibility  on their articles.</p>
<p><b>3. </b>In order to be published, authors must sign the Copyrights Letter, which  is sent to the  authors by e-mail, thus  granting rights, including on translation, to BAR.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BAR adopts iThenticate  to control for plagiarism.</p>
<p>There are no fees for submitting, reviewing or publishing articles in  BAR.</p>
