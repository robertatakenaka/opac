    <TD width="70%"><P>The purpose of  the Latin American Journal of Nursing (RLAE) is to contribute to the advancement  of scientific knowledge and professional practice in Nursing and other  healthcare areas through the publication of articles of high scientific merit. It  contains unpublished articles in English, Portuguese and Spanish, in the  categories Original Article, Systematic Review and Letters to the Editor. It  adopts the rolling pass system. Special numbers are published at the Board of  Editors discretion. Peer review is the adopted evaluation process, with the  anonymity of authors and reviewers preserved.</P>
      <P> The journal  adopts the standardization of &quot;Uniform Requirements for manuscripts  submitted to biomedical journals&quot; (Vancouver Style (<a href="http://www.icmje.org/recommendations">http://www.icmje.org/recommendations</a>).</P>
      <P> RLAE follows  the ethical conduct code recommended by the <em>Committee on Publication Ethics</em> (COPE) (<a href="http://publicationethics.org/">http://publicationethics.org</a>) and the <em>Code of Conduct and Best  Practice Guidelines for Journal Editors</em> (<a href="http://publicationethics.org/resources/code-conduct">http://publicationethics.org/resources/code-conduct</a>).</P>
      <P> All articles  should be forwarded to the journal with the copy of the Research Ethics  Committee approval in cases of human research (except public domain data). The  clinical trial type studies must have the number of the Clinical Trials  Approval Record (<a href="http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/">http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br</a>) which should be sent to the journal. In  cases involving research with animals, the approval of the Ethics Committee on  Animal Use should be forwarded.</P>
      <P>Articles  must be submitted by the ScholarOne (<a href="https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/rlae-scielo">https://mc04.manuscriptcentral.com/rlae-scielo</a>)  in Portuguese or English or Spanish and intended exclusively for RLAE. Simultaneous  presentation to any other publication vehicle is not permitted. RLAE considers  as ethical infraction the duplicate or fragmented publication of the same  research. The journal has tools for locating text similarity to detect  plagiarism.</P></TD>

      <li><strong>Authorship </strong></li>
    </ul>
      <p>The concept of  authorship adopted by RLAE is based on the substantial contribution of each of  the individuals listed as authors, especially in the design and planning of the  research project, obtaining or analyzing and interpreting data, writing and  critical review. The number of authors is limited to six and, exceptionally,  for multicentric studies, it should be considered the possibility of including  more authors, considering the justifications presented by them. Names of  authors whose contribution does not fit the mentioned criteria are not  permitted, and, in this case, they may be included in the section  Acknowledgments.</p>
      <p> The  contribution of each of the authors should be explained in a declaration,  signed individually by the authors, for this purpose and sent to RLAE at the  submission of the manuscript. All authors must inform their ORCID registration  number (<a href="http://orcid.org/">http://orcid.org</a>).</p>
      <p> The concepts  emitted in the articles are the exclusive responsibility of the author(s), not  necessarily reflecting the opinion of the Editors and the Editorial Board. </p>
      <p>Identification data of the responsible author (register)</p>
      <p>          <strong>Name and  surname</strong>. The authors  should follow the format by which their names are already indexed in the  databases and include the ORCID registration number.</p>
