      <p>RBGN only accepts  unpublished articles by both foreign and Brazilian authors on national or  international issues in the areas of Business Administration and Accounting (in  accordance with the editorial scope). Articles must be  written in Portuguese, English, or Spanish, preferably be of long-term  relevance and significant for the scenario of corporate management.&nbsp;<strong>Priority  is given to articles featuring a relevant theoretical contribution to the  literature of Business Administration and Accounting.</strong></p>
      <p>Articles should be  written in a clear, concise and objective style and be in accordance with the  usual academic way of referring to concepts and ideas. As  they write their articles, authors should focus on the methodological procedures,  the way data were processed, and the conclusions, thus emphasizing the topics  that contribute in the stricter sense to the area of business administration.</p>
      <p><strong>Submission  Preparation Checklist</strong><br>
        As part of the submission process, authors are  required to check off their submission's compliance with all of the following  items, and submissions may be returned to authors that do not adhere to these  guidelines.</p>
      <p>  <strong>General  Guidelines</strong><br>
        <strong>Scope:</strong> The  thematic areas of the review, as defined by its Editorial Board, are: (I)  Accounting and Controlling; (II) Strategy; (III) Finance; (IV) Personnel  Management, and (V) Marketing.</p>
      <p>  <strong>Number of  authors:</strong> A maximum of four authors per paper is allowed; authors may not be changed   (removed, included or replaced) after the article has been submitted online.  Authorship change requests will result in filing of the paper. If there  is more than one author, please name the author in charge to whom our editorial  correspondence may be sent and who will follow the submission process.</p>
      <p><strong>Authorship criteria:</strong> According  to criteria adapted from ICMJE (1985), only authors may be designated as such  who have sufficiently participated in the development of the work, from  research design to its dissemination, thus being suitable to take public  responsibility for its content. Authorship credits should be based exclusively  on substantial contributions to:</p>
      <p> (i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the design, planning, analysis or  interpretation of data;<br>
        (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp; the writing of the article or its critical  intellectual review;<br>
        (iii)&nbsp; the responsibility for the final approval for  publication of the article.</p>
      <p> All those conditions (i, ii and iii) must be  complied with. Minor contributions, such as suggestion of literature, data  analysis, or assistance in publishing do not guarantee authorship credits.  These and other contributions to the work may be recognized separately in the  form of &ldquo;acknowledgements&rdquo;, according to the authors' decision. However, acknowledgements  must be excluded from the article upon its submission. They may be added to the  article after it was accepted for publication.</p>
      <p>  <strong>Contribution  of each author</strong><br>
        Each author should take responsibility for at  least one component of the paper. If the article is aproved for publication,  authors should indicate in the diagram below, what was the contribution of  each.</p>
      <p> This information will be available in  publications as end notal in accordance with the Criteria, policies and  procedures for admission and permanence of scientific journals in SciELO Brazil  Collection.</p>
      <p>  <strong>Affiliation  of authors:</strong> Upon submission  of the paper, a  biography of all authors containing ORCID, name, title, institutional  affiliation, city/country of origin and academic title MUST be submitted in the  form of additional documentation. Please rank authors according to the level of their involvement and  contribution to the paper. </p>
<p>  <strong>Identification  of authorship and co-authorship:</strong> Articles may not mention the names of  the author or co-authors, not even in the file properties. Should the author(s)  be identified in the text, the reference list, or in the file properties, the  article will be filed.</p>
      <p>  <strong>Originality  of articles:</strong> Papers  must be inedited, may not be under consideration for publication elsewhere  and/or may not have been previously published by any other vehicle, except for  papers published in conference proceedings and excerpts derived from theses and  dissertations. <strong>Regarding previous  publications in conference proceedings, only paper that contain substantial  advances regarding the version presented at the event will be admitted.  Concerning papers derived from theses and dissertations, the first author must  also be the one of the original work, but other authors may be included. In  both cases, the versions prior to the one submitted to RBGN should be mentioned  (name, edition, place and date of the event) and (title, author, institution  and year of the thesis/dissertation).</strong></p>
      <p>  <strong>Plagiarism:</strong> Content of  the signed articles are the sole and exclusive responsibility of the authors.  Upon submitting an article, the author(s) warrant that it does not violate any  copyright or any other right of any third party. RBGN uses CrossCheck (a  plagiarism software program developed by iThenticate, on the initiative of  CrossRef) to fight academic and professional plagiarism by checking the  originality of submitted and published articles. Should plagiarism be detected  in any article submitted to RBGN, the manuscript will be filed and the authors  will not be allowed to submit other articles to the revue for a period of five  years.
